      <title>Thermally Labile Organic-Soluble Heterometal Diorganophosphate-Derived Efficient Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Heterometal phosphates are burgeoning electrocatalysts and cathode materials in energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we demonstrate a novel and clean synthetic route for substoichiometric lithium-deficient metastable Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 (Li-Co-P-HEX) and metaphosphate P212121-LiCo(PO3)3 (Li-Co-P-BT), starting from the same starting material [LiCo(dtbp)3] (dtbp = di-tert-butyl phosphate) through a thermolytic single-source precursor approach. The heterometal organophosphate [LiCo(dtbp)3] decomposed into different phases of inorganic heterometal phosphates by employing a solution and solid-state thermal treatment. The solution-processed Li-deficient orthophosphate exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at an overpotential of 294 mV, outperforming other reported lithium&#8211;cobalt phosphates for water oxidation. The enhanced performance of the Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 as an electrocatalyst elucidates the synergistic effect generated by the structure, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Electrochemical Transformations on a Metal-Oxide Surface during Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05931</link>
      <description>Tanja Cuk, Michael Paolino, Suryansh Singh, James J. P. Stewart, Xihan Chen, Ilya Vinogradov, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399767385

                Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamic structural evolution of oxygen vacancies enriched SrFe12O19 for efficient reverse water gas shift reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153205</link>
      <description>Gaje Singh, Jyotishman Kaishyop, Md Jahiruddin Gazi, Vivek Kumar Shrivastaw, Mumtaj Shah, Indrajit Ghosh, Tuhin S. Khan, Ankur Bordoloi, Chemical engineering journal. 494(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399771486

                The Reverse Water-Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction is recognized as a potentially promising pathway to serve the dual purpose, possible shifting of CO2 from a linear economy to a circular and positive economic impact in the current industrial process. This study is engaged to develop a series of oxygen vacancies enriched M&#8722;type strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) catalysts via doping of transition metals like Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni for the rWGS reaction. Cu-doped SrFe12O19 exhibited 100 % CO selectivity and a CO production rate of 2850 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat-1, at a comparatively lower temperature (500 &#176;C), outpacing the performance of almost all non-precious metal-based catalytic systems. Moreover, the catalyst was active without the requirement of the H2 pre-reduction procedure and displayed remarkable stability tested up to 200 h without any significant deactivation, making it more industrially relevant. The characterization of as-prepared catalysts indicates the enrichment of oxygen vacancies and reducibility after the involvement of the dopant in the SrFe12O19 system. The formation of various iron species (Fe3O4, Fe3C, and Fe5C2) was revealed by the in-situ studies and post-reaction characterizations of the catalyst system, and their relative amounts were significantly affected by the nature of doping elements, which subsequently influenced the CO selectivity. The dynamic structural evolution and surface-adsorbed species were identified using in-situ Raman and DRIFTS studies. Finally, the structure&#8211;activity relationship was rationalized through not only several ex-situ/in-situ characterization techniques but also an in-detailed Density functional theory (DFT) study.</description>

      <title>A Review on Highly Efficient Ru-Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c02080</link>
      <description>Jiayi Li, Zeng Ju, Fangchen Zhao, Xinran Sun, Sibo Wang, Xingwen Lu, Energy &amp; fuels. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399772787

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is seen as the most compatible hydrogen production technology with renewable energy generation. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the scarcity of acid-resistant, high-activity, and low-cost catalysts have seriously hindered the overall efficiency and manufacturing costs of PEMWE. Recently, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials have gradually attracted attention due to their suitable binding strength toward oxygen intermediates and lowest price in the noble metal family. Herein, the great achievements and progress of Ru-based acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively reviewed, which started with a general description of reaction mechanisms and in situ characterization techniques to understand the structure&#8211;activity relationships. Subsequently, some typical strategies to enhance the activity and stability of Ru-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. Insights from synthesis methods, advanced characterizations, intermediate evolution, and theoretical calculations are provided, together with our viewpoints on the daunting challenges and future endeavors of Ru-based OER electrocatalysts for their practical employment.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Electro-oxidation Mechanism of 5-Aminotetrazole on Nickel-Based Oxides and Synthesizing 5,5&#8242;-Azotetrazolate Salts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c01703</link>

                With the gradual expansion of the application of organic electromechanical synthesis in the field of energetic materials, it is necessary to explore deeply the mechanisms behind the organic electromechanical oxidation of energetic materials in order to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Electrochemical synthesis of 5,5&#8242;-azotetrazolate (ZT) salts is not only environmentally friendly and efficient but also can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) combined with hydrogen production, significantly reducing the battery voltage of overall water splitting (OWS) and achieving low energy consumption hydrogen production. Here, we prepared the Co-modified nickel-based oxide electrodes (Ni3&#8211;xCoO4/carbon cloth (CC), x = 1, 2) as a medium to reveal the oxidative coupling mechanism of 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT). Experimental and theoretical calculations verified that Ni-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 5-AT is a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, including electron transfer of electrocatalytic intermediates (Ni2+&#8211;O + OH&#8211; = Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) + e&#8211;) and spontaneous dehydrogenation process (Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;O + X&#8226;). The Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) is an extremely fast nonreducing electron transfer center that serves as a chemical oxidant to directly abstract hydrogen atoms from the 5-AT. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of Co doping on the electric cloud around Ni causes the upshift of the d-band centers, which is conducive to the easier adsorption of OH*, forming the generation of active intermediate Ni3+&#8211;O(OH). Thus, Ni2CoO4/CC has higher Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield for the oxidation reaction of 5-AT, with a yield of approximately 72.3% after electrolysis at 1.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</description>

                Exploiting highly active bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts for reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with CoFe alloys and Fe2N (denoted as CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs) has been successfully constructed. The introduction of Fe2N can not only regulate the electronic structure of the FeCo alloy but also provide sufficient metal-Nx catalytic sites. Besides, the strong synergistic effect among CoFe alloy, Fe2N, and N-CNTs endows CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs with prominent bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance toward ORR and OER (&#916;E = 0.669 V), superior to that of the FeCo alloy@N-CNTs without Fe2N and commercial precious metal-based catalyst. Importantly, the assembled aqueous Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB) possesses a high open-circuit voltage (1.60 V), high peak power density (173 mW cm&#8211;2), and prominent good charge&#8211;discharge stability (1000 h), surpassing commercial precious metal catalysts.</description>

      <title>pH Effects on Electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production and Flooding in Gas-Diffusion Electrodes for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c02325</link>
      <description>Takuya Okazaki, Kento Shibata, Chihiro Tateishi, K. Enomoto, Kosuke Beppu, Fumiaki Amano, ACS sustainable chemistry &amp; engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399812282

                Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) is a crucial process for on-site and on-demand H2O2 production. Evaluating the impact of the medium's pH is essential for achieving selective H2O2 production at higher current density through continuous O2 supply to gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) in membrane electrolyzers. We investigated the effect of electrolyte pH on both H2O2 production and the flooding behavior of GDEs loaded with a cobalt single-atom catalyst in a typical H-type cell. The electrocatalyst was prepared by heating cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin loaded on Ketjen Black (CoTPP/KB) at 750 &#176;C. Remarkably, the cobalt single-atom catalyst exhibited high current density when the top of the hydrophobic gas-diffusion layer was exposed to the gas phase, facilitating efficient O2 diffusion within the GDE. Potential&#8211;time curves at &#8722;40 mA cm&#8211;2 showed stable potentials and Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;80%) over 5 h across a pH range from 1 to 10, with the H2O2 concentration reaching approximately 100 mmol L&#8211;1 at pH 1.0. In contrast, the potential at pH 13 decreased abruptly in 3 h due to the flooding of GDE. Long-term tests demonstrated stable electrocatalytic H2O2 production only in the acidic electrolytes for 24 h, attributed to reduced flooding with decreasing pH. These findings underscore the impact of electrolyte pH on GDE performance during H2O2 production via the 2e&#8211; ORR, with acidity favoring the mitigation of undesirable flooding behavior.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Arrays Composed of Atomically Thin Nanosheets: Simultaneous Improvements in Thermodynamics and Kinetics for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting in Neutral Media</title>

                Abstract The inefficiency of electrocatalysts for water splitting in neutral media stems from a comprehensive impact of poor intrinsic activity, a limited number of active sites, and inadequate mass transport. Herein, hierarchical ultrathin NiCo 2 Se 4 nanosheets are synthesized by the selenization of NiCo 2 O 4 porous nanoneedles. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity primarily originate from the NiCo 2 Se 4 , whereas the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is related to the NiCoOOH due to the structural reconstruction. The abundant Se and O vacancies introduced by atomically thin nanostructure modulate the electronic structure of NiCo 2 Se 4 and NiCoOOH, thereby improving the intrinsic HER and OER activities, respectively. COMSOL simulation demonstrate the edges of extended nanosheets from the main body significantly promote the charge aggregation, boosting the reduction and oxidation current during HER/OER process. This charge aggregation effect notably exceeds the tip effect for the nanoneedle, highlighting the unique advantage of the hierarchical nanosheet structure. Benefiting from abundant vacancies and unique nanostructure, the hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet simultaneously improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrocatalyst. The optimized samples display an overpotential of 92 mV for HER and 214 mV for OER at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , significantly surpassing the performance of currently reported HER/OER catalysts in neutral media.</description>

                Abstract The development of advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional performance at high current densities is pivotal for reducing electric energy consumption in industrial water splitting for hydrogen production. Herein, a flexible one&#8208;step electrodeposition approach is developed to synthesize superhydrophilic 3D flower&#8208;like clusters of Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P nanosheets grown in situ on nickel foam (NF). Introducing Cu into Co&#8211;P causes strong electron interactions, forming an electronic configuration favorable for the adsorption and desorption of intermediates, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity. The as&#8208;deposited Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P/NF display notable bifunctional catalytic activity with low overpotentials of 259 and 65 mV for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Superwetting 3D flower&#8208;like nanostructures are conducive to the penetration of electrolytes and the rapid release of bubbles, enabling the efficient utilization of active sites and the timely release of bubble stress under high current densities. An assembled Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P/NF(+, &#8722;) electrolyzer achieves an impressive voltage of 1.85 V at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 for water splitting and appreciable stability for over 220 h under simulated industrial conditions. This work offers an attractive strategy for regulating superaerophobic Co&#8211;P electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting, which can contribute to practical applications.</description>

                Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have obtained widespread attention as next-generation energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. However, the high charge overpotential, attributed to the insulating property of Li2O2, significantly limits the energy efficiency and triggers solvent degradation. The high electrochemical activities of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) on the cathode are crucial for alleviating the high charging polarizations and enhancing the lifetime of Li&#8211;O2 batteries, which are also top challenges of state-of-art research. In this review, the scientific challenges and the proposed solutions in the development of cathode catalysts have been summarized. The recent research advancements on the nanoengineering of cathode catalysts for Li&#8211;O2 batteries have been comprehensively discussed, and the perspectives on the structure optimization are presented. Meanwhile, we have elucidated the structure&#8211;performance relationship between the electronic state and performance of the cathode catalysts at the nanoscale level. This review intends to provide guidelines for the design and construction of cathode catalysts in advanced Li&#8211;O2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Revealing Structural Evolution of Nickel Phosphide-Iron Oxide Core&#8211;Shell Nanocatalysts in Alkaline Medium for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00379</link>

                Metal phosphide-containing materials have emerged as a potential candidate of nonprecious metal-based catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While it is known that metal phosphide undergoes structural evolution, considerable debate persists regarding the effects of dynamics on the surface activation and morphological stability of the catalysts. In this study, we synthesize NiPx-FeOx core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts with an amorphous NiPx core designed for enhanced OER activity. Using ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we elucidate the local structural changes as a function of the cyclic voltammetry cycles. Our studies suggest that the presence of corner-sharing octahedra in the FeOx shell improves structural rigidity through interlayer cross-linking, thereby inhibiting the diffusion of OH&#8211;/H2O. Thus, the FeOx shell preserves the amorphous NiPx core from rapid oxidation to Ni3(PO4)2 and Ni(OH)2. On the other hand, the incorporation of Ni from the core into the FeOx shell facilitates absorption of hydroxide ions for OER. As a result, Ni/Fe(OH)x at the surface oxidizes to the active &#947;-(oxy)hydroxide phase under the applied potentials, promoting OER. This intriguing synergistic behavior holds significance as such a synthetic route involving the FeOx shell can be extended to other systems, enabling manipulation of surface adsorption and diffusion of hydroxide ions. These findings also demonstrate that nanomaterials with core&#8211;shell morphologies can be tuned to leverage the strength of each metallic component for improved electrochemical activities.</description>

      <title>NiMo&#8322;S&#8324;-VS&#8322; heterostructure on nickel Foam: A promising electrocatalyst for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118436</link>

                Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is a slow process; therefore, improved kinetics require catalytic active centers and higher charge transfer capacities. In the present study, a novel heterostructure made of nickel molybdenum sulfide and vanadium disulfide supported on nickel foam (NiMo2S4-VS2/NF) substrate is fabricated using a single-step hydrothermal process. The structural, morphological, elemental, and textural properties of the fabricated materials are confirmed via various analytical techniques. Furthermore, at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, the observed overpotentials was approximately 318 mV corresponding to an OER in 1 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte. It also shows a lower Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec with large turnover frequency of 2.56 s&#8722;1. The resulting NiMo2S4-VS2/NF showed enhanced charge transfer properties and frequent integrated active sites. Hence the remarkable activity of this catalyst is significantly influenced by the synergistic effect of these combined features and resulted in an efficient overall water splitting. This was ascribed to NiMo2S4 which increases OER at the anode by providing active sites for oxidizing water molecules. In NiMo2S4, Mo and S elements aid to maintain active sites and accelerate reaction kinetics, while Ni sites operate as electrocatalytic efforts for water oxidation. In general, VS2 promotes hydrogen atom recombination into molecular hydrogen while also encouraging HER at the cathode via hydrogen atom adsorption. In general, NiMo2S4-VS2/NF is a suitable option for water splitting applications due to the close proximity of these two components within the structure of the catalyst, which enables charge transfer and surface reactions and also allow for effective OER. This unique approach for designing the catalyst and engineering the heterointerface is a promising strategy to develop novel and efficient OER catalysts.</description>

                Forced by the problems of severe energy crisis, it is urgent to explore high efficiency sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, particularly for electrolytic water devices and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The efficiency of these two devices is mainly dominated by the half-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is the key for the development of water splitting and rechargeable ZABs. The antiperovskites as a promising family of electrocatalyst with structure flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic properties. Defining the enhancement mechanism toward HER, OER, and ORR is an urgent problem for the application of antiperovskite in the electrocatalysis field. This review brief introduces the fundamentals of HER/OER/ORR and summarizes the recent progress of antiperovskite materials in electrocatalysis field, including the research on structural regulation strategies of catalytic properties and catalytic mechanism. Based on ex situ/in situ characterized of electrocatalytic mechanism, the future challenges of antiperovskite in electrocatalytic mechanism and intrinsic modulation were prospected. The basic frontier issues are aimed in the field of HER/OER/ORR to provide theoretical guidance for the development of efficient and economical multifunctional electrocatalysts for ZAB and water splitting.</description>

                Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), especially those containing nickel (Ni), are increasingly recognized for their potential in photo(-/)electrocatalytic water oxidation due to the abundant availability of Ni, their corrosion resistance, and their minimal toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive examination of Ni-based LDHs in electrocatalytic (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water oxidation processes. The review delves into the operational principles, highlighting similarities and distinctions as well as the benefits and limitations associated with each method of water oxidation. It includes a detailed discussion on the synthesis of monolayer, ultrathin, and bulk Ni-based LDHs, focusing on the merits and drawbacks inherent to each synthesis approach. Regarding the EC oxygen evolution reaction (OER), strategies to improve catalytic performance and insights into the structural evolution of Ni-based LDHs during the electrocatalytic process are summarized. Furthermore, the review extensively covers the advancements in Ni-based LDHs for PEC OER, including an analysis of semiconductors paired with Ni-based LDHs to form photoanodes, with a focus on their enhanced activity, stability, and underlying mechanisms facilitated by LDHs. The review concludes by addressing the challenges and prospects in the development of innovative Ni-based LDH catalysts for practical applications. The comprehensive insights provided in this paper will not only stimulate further research but also engage the scientific community, thus driving the field of photo(-/)electrocatalytic water oxidation forward.</description>

                Electrochemical water-splitting is widely acknowledged as a renewable strategy for hydrogen production, but it is primarily constrained by the sluggish reaction kinetics of the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In our study, we employ a fast room-temperature corrosion engineering strategy for the construction of a sulfur-doped Ni-Fe layered dihydroxide catalyst (S-NiFe LDH). With the assistance of a sulfur source, microsphere morphology with an ultra-thin lamellar surface cross-arrangement can be rapidly grown on the surface of an iron foam substrate, ensuring a substantial electrochemical interface. The composition of Ni species in the catalysts can be regulated by simply adjusting the amount of Ni2+ and reaction time. Functioning as an OER catalyst, the S-NiFe LDH demonstrates high activity and reaction kinetics, featuring a minimal overpotential of 120.0 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 39.5 mV dec&#8722;1 and a notable electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of 31.3 mF cm&#8722;2. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to its distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structure and sulfur dopants, which effectively regulate the electrochemical interface and electronic structure of NiFe LDH. This work provides valuable insights for expeditious materials design.</description>

                Abstract Water electrolysis has become an attractive hydrogen production method. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck of water splitting as its four&#8208;electron transfer procedure presents sluggish reaction kinetics. Designing composite catalysts with high performance for efficient OER still remains a huge challenge. Here, the P&#8208;doped cobalt oxide/NiFe layered double hydroxides (P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs) composite catalysts with amorphous/crystalline interfaces are successfully prepared for OER by hydrothermal&#8208;electrodeposition combined method. The results of electrochemical characterizations, operando Raman spectra, and DFT theoretical calculations have demonstrated the electrons in the P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs heterointerfaces are easily transferred from Ni 2+ to Co 3+ because that the amorphous configuration of P&#8208;CoO X can well induce Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Co orbital coupling. The electron transfer of Ni 2+ to the surrounding Fe 3+ and Co 3+ will lead to the unoccupied e g orbitals of Ni 3+ that can promote water dissociation and accelerate * OOH migration to improve OER catalytic performance. The optimized P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs exhibit superior catalytic performance for OER with a very low overpotential of 265 mV at 300 mA cm &#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability of 500 h with almost no attenuation at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work will provide a new method to design high&#8208;performance NiFe LDHs&#8208;based catalysts for OER.</description>

                Developing low&#8208;cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of vital significance for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we fabricate a heterostructure NiS/Ni(OH)x electrocatalyst (Ni&#8208;S&#8208;n) with regenerative oxygen vacancies via electro&#8208;deposition on nickel foam (NF) followed by a facile NaBH4 reduction. The resulting Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst with appropriate amount of oxygen vacancies (Ovs) exhibits extraordinary activity for alkaline OER with overpotential of 142 mV and 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. This catalyst also shows remarkable durability with 40 h. After the stability test, the excellent OER performance is well recovered by regenerating the surface oxygen vacancies (Ovs) significantly with additional NaBH4 reduction. The Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst still displays good activity even after repeating it three times (180 h). The surface oxygen vacancies act as vital active sites for OER. A mechanism of Ovs species transformation and regeneration based on the Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst is proposed, which provides a new direction for exploring ultrastable and efficient OER electrocatalysts with renewable active species.</description>

      <title>A photocatalytic redox cycle over a polyimide catalyst drives efficient solar-to-H2O2 conversion</title>

                Abstract Circumventing the conventional two-electron oxygen reduction pathway remains a great problem in enhancing the efficiency of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis. A promising approach to achieve outstanding photocatalytic activity involves the utilization of redox intermediates. Here, we engineer a polyimide aerogel photocatalyst with photoreductive carbonyl groups for non-sacrificial H 2 O 2 production. Under photoexcitation, carbonyl groups on the photocatalyst surface are reduced, forming an anion radical intermediate. The produced intermediate is oxidized by O 2 to produce H 2 O 2 and subsequently restores the carbonyl group. The high catalytic efficiency is ascribed to a photocatalytic redox cycle mediated by the radical anion, which not only promotes oxygen adsorption but also lowers the energy barrier of O 2 reduction reaction for H 2 O 2 generation. An apparent quantum yield of 14.28% at 420 &#177; 10 nm with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.92% is achieved. Moreover, we demonstrate that a mere 0.5 m 2 self-supported polyimide aerogel exposed to natural sunlight for 6 h yields significant H 2 O 2 production of 34.3 mmol m &#8722;2 .</description>

                Abstract Renewable energy&#8208;driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero&#8208;emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir&#8208;based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure&#8208;performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core&#8208;shell, single&#8208;atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

                Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous crystalline materials, synthesized by combining organic linkers and secondary building blocks. Their remarkable designs and flexibility facilitate functional linkers and engineering synergies between the metal nodes, making them appropriate platforms for an extensive variety of applications. The high surface area, controllable porosity, and good stability make them promising materials. The oxygen evolution reaction is the important half-cell reaction that plays a key role in energy conversion and storage devices such as water electrolyzers, regenerative fuel cells, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. The main obstacle in the OER is the sluggish kinetics, the four-electron transfer process requires high overpotential for OER. The development of sophisticated electrocatalysts with high activity and stability based on non-noble metal elements remains a great challenge</description>

                Recently, CoP is considered as a very promising electrode material for rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB). In this study, a Prussian blue analogue (Co3[Co(CN)6]2, PBA) derived CoP coupling with N-doped carbon (NC) as an effective oxygen electrocatalyst PBA-CoP/NC was prepared. Notably, as-prepared PBA-CoP/NC has good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance even comparable to Pt/C (0.855 V), with half wave potential reaching 0.847 V. While, it also has satisfactory performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Importantly, the PBA-CoP/NC assembled ZAB exhibits an open circuit potential of 1.62 V, and a peak power density of 119.3 mW cm&#8722;2, as well as good stability. This PBA-CoP/NC catalyst would give good reference to developing advanced carbon-based electrocatalyst, also has great potential applied in other energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effect to unlock the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction in spinel LiMn2O4 via d-block metal substitution</title>

                An effective strategy using d-block metal hybridization was proposed to induce electronic interaction and promote the synergistic effect, aiming to enhance the OER performance of cost-effective spinel LiMn2O4. Indeed, we deploy a series of LiNixMn2-xO4 catalysts substituted with Ni, yielding the increase of Mn valence states from Mn3.5+ to Mn4+. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 catalyst achieved an excellent OER performance in alkaline media, with an overpotential reduction more than 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared to the unsubstituted LiMn2O4, as well as the electrochemical stability. It was shown to be superior to most reported Mn-based oxide OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that Ni dopes holes in the Mn site, leading to an increase in Mn4+, and that the shared covalent network of Ni 3d-O 2p-Mn 3d optimized an easier desorption of intermediates. These results pave a new example for modulating the chemisorption strength, thus enabling activating the activity and stability of the OER process for cost-effective electrocatalysts based on spinel Mn oxides.</description>

                In this paper, a series of LaMnO3+&#948; (LMOs) were successfully prepared by adjusting the sintering temperature using the sol-gel method with ABO3-type LMO oxides as the object of study. The results showed that with the increase of sintering temperature, the Oads, oxygen vacancies, and Mn4+ content in the system gradually decreased, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was subsequently weakened. Although the suitable Mn3+/Mn4+ valence ratio (2.15:1) of the LMO700 sample created a strong ferromagnetic double-exchange effect, the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in LMO700 disturbed this effect and weakened its macro magnetism. This paper serves to contribute to the design and development of new magnetic perovskite electrocatalysts.</description>

                Co&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their low price and excellent catalytic performance. Herein, strategies of ion leaching and surface reconstruction to form more catalytic active sites are proposed, and accordingly improving the intrinsic activity of OER catalyst. First, the Co&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)/Ni precursors are synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal method. Then, the second hydrothermal reaction is carried out in sodium metavanadate solution, and a highly active V&#8208;doped Co&#8208;MOFs/Ni OER catalyst with particle coating is obtained. The results show that V&#8208;doped Co&#8208;MOFs/Ni in 1 m KOH solution shows excellent performance, that is, low overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , Tafel slope of 56 mV dec &#8722;1 , small charge transfer impedance, large electrochemically active area of 1.71 mF cm &#8722;2 , and good stability. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;atomic emission spectrometry measurements confirm that the V ions play a dominant role in leaching, while the Co ions negligibly contribute to the leaching. This work paves an alternative approach for advancing the synthesis of high&#8208;efficiency nonprecious OER catalysts by such a facile green method.</description>

However, the lack of a universal HEO preparation method severely limits the property study and application of HEOs. Herein, we report a universal approach of spray pyrolysis for the preparation of various HEOs and study the electrocatalytic performance of HEOs toward the oxygen evolution reaction.

      <title>The Effect of Surface Oxygen Coverage on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction over a CoFeNiCr High-Entropy Alloy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14121058</link>

                Developing cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy applications. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) made from earth-abundant transition metals, thanks to their remarkable stability and electrocatalytic performance, provide a promising alternative to expensive electrocatalysts typically derived from noble metals. While pristine HEA surfaces have been theoretically investigated, and the effect of oxygen coverage on conventional metal electrocatalysts has been examined, the impact of surface oxygen coverage on the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reconstruct the free energy diagram of OER intermediates on CoFeNiCr HEA surfaces with varying oxygen coverages, evaluating their impact on the rate-limiting step and theoretical overpotential. Our findings reveal that increased oxygen coverage weakens the adsorption of HO* and O*, but not HOO*. As a result, the theoretical overpotential for the OER decreases with higher oxygen coverage, and the rate-limiting step shifts from the third oxidation step (HOO* formation) at low coverage to the first oxidation step (HO* formation) at higher coverage.</description>

                Abstract Enabling a hydrogen fuel-based economy is reliant on the discovery of materials that catalyze the electrolysis of water which requires low-cost catalytic electrodes to improve the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. Fe2.5Ni2.5Sn3, was prepared by arc-melting and electrochemical studies were conducted to evaluate its ability to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction. Potentiodynamic polarization testing revealed that the Fe2.5Ni2.5Sn3 alloy had a Tafel slope of 40 mV/decade and required an overpotential of 326 mV in order to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicated that the native oxide present on the surface became hydrated upon subjecting it to oxygen evolution studies.</description>

                To alleviate the problems of environmental pollution and energy crisis, aggressive development of clean and alternative energy technologies, in particular, water splitting, metal&#8211;air batteries, and fuel cells involving two key half reactions comprising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR), is crucial. In this work, an innovative hybrid comprising heterogeneous Cu/Co bimetallic nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed on a nitrogen-doped carbon layer (Cu/Co/NC) was constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and ORR via a hydrothermal reaction along with post-solid-phase sintering technique. Thanks to the interfacial coupling and electronic synergism between the Cu and Co bimetallic nanoparticles, the Cu/Co/NC catalyst showed improved catalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.865 V and an excellent stability of more than 30 h, even compared to 20 wt% Pt/C. The Cu/Co/NC catalyst also exhibited excellent HER catalytic performance with an overpotential of below 149 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and long-term operation for over 30 h.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Highly Active GaN:ZnO Photocatalysts Applicable to Z-Scheme Overall Water Splitting Systems</title>

                The Z-scheme system, integrating an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) with a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), is an ideal strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), in which the development of an efficient OEP remains a challenge. Herein, the GaN:ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized by an ammonium halide-based process to perform a recorded apparent quantum yield of 30% at 420 nm for oxygen evolution from water. It made the GaN:ZnO a remarkable OEP for the construction of three distinct Z-scheme OWS systems, including an unbiased-photoelectrochemical sheet, direct collision, and redox-ion-mediated electron shuttle. The features and parameters of each Z-scheme system were discussed in relation to water splitting, and the most efficient one was established by employing [Fe(CN)6]3&#8211;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8211; as an electron shuttle and SrTiO3:Rh as an HEP. This work not only provides a methodology for synthesizing an efficient GaN:ZnO photocatalyst but also highlights its great potential as an OEP applicable to constructing various Z-scheme OWS systems.</description>

                Exploring the intrinsic relationship between the network structure and the performance of catalyst layer (CL) by rational design its structure is of paramount importance for proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. This study reveals the relative effect of polymeric dispersion evolution on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and cell voltage loss and linked to CL network structure. The results show that although the dispersed particle size of the ionomer and ink increases with increasing the solubility parameter (&#948;) difference between the mixed solvent and the ionomer, MeOH-cat (ink from MeOH aqueous solution) has the largest ionomer and ink particle size resulting in the poorest stability, but has comparable OER overpotential to that of IPA-cat (249 mV@10 mA cm</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Protective Carbon Shells for Improved Stability of Alkaline Water Oxidation Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00688</link>

                In recent years, carbon shells have garnered attention as possible protective layers that can be applied to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to prevent corrosion under alkaline conditions. However, thermodynamic considerations and experimental results indicate that these carbon shells are subject to corrosion themselves, limiting their applicability as protective coatings against oxidation. Herein, the thermodynamics of carbon corrosion are presented with spectrometric, spectroscopic, crystallographic, microscopy, and electrochemical measurements, emphasizing the inevitable degradation of carbon under alkaline OER conditions. Recent work focused on suppressing this carbon corrosion is then discussed alongside future directions for carbon shells in water oxidation research.</description>

                We studied the influence of the surface and crystal lattice about both H2-oxidation reaction and electronic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The oxygen evolution phenomena in CeO2 NPs were observed in reducing (hydrogen or vacuum) atmosphere. In the catalytic hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR) of CeO2, nonstoichiometric CeO2 produces active oxygen species which react with H2 to form H2O. The CeO2 NPs showed the main TPR temperature of the lattice oxygen at around 700 &#176;C (slow reaction). A low temperature peak appeared at around 500 &#176;C, which is originated from the surface of CeO2 (fast reaction). The active oxygen formation was characterized by different activation energies which were newly determined as 77&#177;18 kJmol-1 (on surface) and 131&#177;16 kJmol-1 (in lattice) for NPs, respectively. Regarding with the electric current response of CeO2 NP, we found the relatively fast peak-out peak and then the gradual increase at 300 &#176;C under the low oxygen pressure of 5&#215;10-3 Pa (vacuum). These were both related to the fast and slow release of oxygen on the surface and then in the lattice of CeO2 NPs. The comparative TPR and electric current observations revealed the common reduction behavior on surface and in bulk region of CeO2 NPs.</description>

                Abstract LiNi x Co y Al z O 2 (NCA) and LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 (NCM) have become extensively utilized as cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage applications that necessitate consistent power output over prolonged periods and under varying environmental conditions. A crucial structural degradation issue leading to cycling&#8208;induced deterioration, rapid loss of cell capacity/voltage, and the onset of undesirable thermal runaway events involves the decay of cathode materials enriched in nickel. This contribution offers a comprehensive evaluation of cutting&#8208;edge strategies in engineering and material design to enhance the structural stability of cathode materials and reduce detrimental oxygen evolution reactions. It also provides the most recent discoveries regarding oxygen release phenomena and associated mechanisms contributing to structural breakdown in high&#8208;nickel cathodes. The primary source of oxygen depletion and the ensuing structural deterioration caused are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the kinetic mechanisms responsible for oxygen loss are scrutinized, and measures to mitigate resulting electrochemical degradation are elaborated. This overview can guide researchers in the development of oxygen&#8208;containing cathode materials in the future, where oxygen leakage is of lesser concern compared to other forms of deterioration.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction is the bottleneck to energy-efficient water-based electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), precious metals have generally been necessary for the stable catalysis of this reaction. In this work, we report that delamination of cobalt tungstate enables high activity and durability through the stabilization of oxide and water-hydroxide networks of the lattice defects in acid. The resulting catalysts achieve lower overpotentials, a current density of 1.8 amperes per square centimeter at 2 volts, and stable operation up to 1 ampere per square centimeter in a PEMWE system at industrial conditions (80&#176;C) at 1.77 volts; a threefold improvement in activity; and stable operation at 1 ampere per square centimeter over the course of 600 hours.</description>

                Abstract Homogeneous microstructure in lead alloy matrix plays an important role in improving its mechanical and electrochemical properties. In this work, different stirring speed provided during the melt casting of the alloy are tended to obtain lead alloys with different microstructure. The results show that proper stirring speed is beneficial for improving the overall homogeneity of the alloy, however, as the stirring speed is too high, plenty of second phase impurities and defects produced in the lead matrix, which possesses negative effect on the mechanical and electrochemical properties. The most uniform composition and homogeneous microstructure was obtained when the stirring speed is 100 r/min, which is conducive to the decrease of oxygen evolution potential of 30 mV and charge transfer resistance of 22.77%, and the increase of the corrosion resistance of 1.49%, and promote the generation of the uniform and dense PbO2 protective layer.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary The electrochemical processes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a crucial role in various energy storage and conversion systems. However, the inherently slow kinetics of reversible oxygen reactions present an urgent demand for the development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. Recently, metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) derivatives have attracted extensive attention in electrocatalysis research due to their unique porous structure, abundant active sites, and tunable structural properties. Especially, the optimization of the electronic structure of active sites in MOF derivatives has been proven as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity. In this review, we provide an overview of the electronic structure optimization strategies for active sites in MOF derivatives as advanced catalysts in various O&#8212;O bond activation reactions, including the construction of synergistic effects between multiple sites, the development of heterogeneous interfaces, the utilization of metal support interactions, and the precise modulation of organic ligands surrounding catalytic active sites at the atomic level. Furthermore, this review offers theoretical insights into the oxygen activation and catalytic mechanisms of MOF derivatives, as well as the identification of active sites. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of MOF derivatives in electrocatalysis are discussed. This review contributes to the understanding and advancement of efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in energy systems. Key Scientists</description>

      <title>Recent Progress and Challenges in Hybrid Water Electrolysis through Economic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00676</link>

                Water electrolysis is a sustainable method of hydrogen production with low levels of CO2 emissions. However, the problem of high economic costs must be resolved. Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg&#8211;1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.</description>

      <title>Effect of cell sintering temperature on the performance of non-noble metal loaded cerium oxide SOEC anodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2783/1/012050</link>

                Abstract Introducing methane oxidation reaction into the anode of the high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) can reduce the power consumption for water electrolysis. Compared to the traditional conditions of methane oxidation, the methane oxidation catalyst sintered at the SOEC anode, which is closely related to the cell sintering process. This study uses non-noble metals as active sites for methane oxidation, zirconia, and samarium oxides doped ceria as catalyst support and oxygen ion conductors. The effects of anode sintering temperature on the electrochemical performance of SOEC assisted by methane oxidation were investigated. The results indicate that the high-temperature sintering process promotes the performance of the SOEC anode with Ni as the active site, while high temperature harms the performance of the Co-loaded anode. The sintering temperature exhibits a poor effect on the Fe-loaded anode. The Ni exhibits good enhancement of methane oxidation on reducing the electrolysis voltage of SOEC, while Co only exhibits methane oxidation assistance at low-temperature sintering. Differently, Fe has almost no obvious methane oxidation assistance for SOEC, which mainly represents good oxygen evolution performance.</description>

                Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) supported single transition metal (TM) atom (TM1/POM) as an efficient soluble redox mediator for Li&#8211;O2 batteries is comprehensively investigated by first-principles calculations. Among the pristine POM and four kinds of TM1/POM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), Co1/POM not only maintains good structural and thermodynamic stability in oxidized and reduced states but also exhibits promising electro(chemical) catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li&#8211;O2 batteries with the lowest Gibbs free energy barriers. Further investigations demonstrate that the moderate binding strength of Li2-xO2 (x = 0, 1, and 2) intermediates on Co1/POM guarantees favorable Li2O2 formation and decomposition. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the introduced Co single atom as an electron transfer bridge can not only efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of POM but also regulate the bonding/antibonding states around the Fermi level of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox. The solvent effect on the OER catalytic performance and the electronic properties of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox with and without dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are also investigated.</description>

                The development of redox bifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance, low cost, and long lifetimes is essential for achieving clean energy goals. This study proposed an atom capture strategy for anchoring dual single atoms (DSAs) in a zinc&#8211;zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn&#8211;ZIF), followed by calcination under an N2 atmosphere to synthesize ruthenium&#8211;platinum DSAs supported on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (RuPt DSAs-NC). Theoretical calculations showed that the degree of Ru 5dxz &#8722; *O 2px orbital hybridization was high when *O was adsorbed at the Ru site, indicating enhanced covalent hybridization of metal sites and oxygen ligands, which benefited the adsorption of intermediate species. The presence of the RuPtN6 active center optimized the absorption&#8211;desorption behavior of intermediates, improving the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuPt DSAs-NC exhibited a 0.87 V high half-wave potential and a 268 mV low overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline environment. Furthermore, rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) achieved a peak power density of 171 mW cm&#8722;2. The RuPt DSAs-NC demonstrated long-term cycling for up to 500 h with superior round-trip efficiency. This study provided an effective structural design strategy to construct DSAs active sites for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.</description>

                Abstract Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated tripodal benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes (CCs), Ni-tPBA0~3, with three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites (OCSs) can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. Specifically, nickel centers with mono-coordinated water undergo the intermolecular oxygen coupling while those with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism (IOM) with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized IOM process appears with the synergy of potential OCSs, enabling fast generation of &#8211;Ni&#8211;(OH)x intermediate and synchronizing the re-coordination of water molecules with the deprotonation of active &#8211;OH for enhanced kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and long-term stability of 150 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 was achieved, superior to most single transition metal-based molecular electrocatalysts. This study underscores the potential of crafting the coordinated water molecules for efficient electrocatalysis applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on the Te/Po doped SrTiO3 (100) surface for photocatalytic overall water splitting to produce hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104645</link>

                The (100) surface of SrTiO3 is inefficient for solar photocatalytic performance because its wide bandgap restricts the response to visible light. The effects of the different surface termination and the doped atoms are investigated to manipulate the solar photocatalytic behavior of the surface. The results reveal that the band edges for the Ti/O-terminated (100) surface of SrTiO3 (SS-I) can straddle the redox potentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but this is not true for the Sr/O-terminated one (SS-II). However, we successfully make the band edges of SS-II meet the HER and OER conditions by the doped Te and Po atoms (Te-SS-II and Po-SS-II), after trying the doped elements of the IIIA-VIA group. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency are 14.50 %, 9.89 %, and 12.75 % for SS-I, Te-SS-II, and Po-SS-II, respectively. The Gibbs free energies are calculated for each HER and OER. The result of -0.34 eV for the HER on SS-I indicates that this reaction can spontaneously proceed. Therefore, these surfaces are promisingly used for photocatalytic water splitting. The present findings provide helpful guidance to manipulate the photocatalytic water splitting on the (100) surfaces of SrTiO3 by choosing the terminal atoms or doped atoms on the surface.</description>

                Developing BiVO4 photoanode with efficient carrier transfer and fast water oxidation kinetics is the permanent pursuit to achieve the state-of-art solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The capacity to increase the PEC activity of BiVO4 by loading oxygen evolution co-catalysts (OECs) has been proven, however it suffers from sluggish charge carriers dynamics brought on by the complicated interface between BiVO4 and OECs as well as poor long-term durability. Herein, we connected OECs (NiFeOx) and photoanode with a Al-O bridge for bettering the PEC performance of BiVO4. The Al-O bridge served as a channel to extract hole from BiVO4 to NiFeOx, thus boosting charge carriers&#8242; separation and preventing BiVO4 from photo-corrosion. The Al-O bridging photoanode (NiFeOx/Al2O3/BiVO4) demonstrated a high photocurrent density of 5.87 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and long-term photostability in comparison to NiFeOx/BiVO4 photoanode. This study proposes a unique technique to boost charge carriers&#8242; separation between BiVO4 and OECs for high-efficiency solar-driven PEC water splitting.</description>

                Designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge that needs to be resolved to enable green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two half-cell reactions of OWS. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize hierarchical het- erostructure MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low overpotentials of 178 mV and 64 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 under light assistance. The MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH&#8214;MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH OWS cell demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA/cm2 during light-assisted water electrolysis. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping of high-valence Mo atoms within and the deposition of MoS2 quantum dots on the LDH matrix improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the elec- trocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the ther- modynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, the facile synthesis method enables the design of highly active MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids is considered a sustainable method to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil. In this study, we assess the effect of monovalent alkali cations (of the acetates) on the performance of Pt electrodes in acid decarboxylation and the competing OER, using various electrochemical methods. We reveal a strong cation dependence generally following the trend Li + &lt;Na + &lt;K + ~Cs + within a large pH range. Using rotating ring disc electrode measurements, we highlight the strong contribution of the oxygen evolution reaction particularly for electrolytes containing Li + and Na + which decreases the selectivity for Kolbe oxidation. In addition, the faradaic efficiency (FE) towards methanol ranges between 16 % (for Li + ) and 29 % (for Cs + ) at high solution pH (9 or 12). The observed trends are generally explained by a cation&#8208;dependent interfacial pH and surface coverage of acetate, both lowest for Li. This is evident from differences in charge transfer resistance determined by impedance measurements and local pH measurements. Additionally, enhanced dissolution of Pt by Li + is also proposed. This work highlights that K + and Cs + cations favor FE for electrochemical Kolbe oxidation, at relatively low current densities.</description>

                The treasure hunting of effective and efficient materials for the renewable hydrogen production through the water splitting process has escalated due to the pressing demand for the clean and sustainable energy sources. In this context, the layered two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenides have become attractive options owing to their special structural and electrical characteristics. In this investigation, the 2D layered copper sulfide (CuS) and copper sulfoselenide (CuSSe) as the electrocatalysts have been carried out for the water splitting applications. The synthesis of CuS and CuSSe nanosheets was achieved by an easy and scalable solvothermal technique, permitting mastery in the fabrication of high-quality 2D layers. The successful formation of 2D layered structure was characterized by using several methods, including the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further, the electrochemical studies of the CuS and CuSSe were conducted to investigate the water splitting performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The laminar 2D nanostructured ternary CuSSe electrocatalyst exhibited a smaller overpotential of &#8722;270 mV with a Tafel value of 153 mV/dec with three-fold enhancement in response rate compared to the binary sample. The results provided the crucial insights for advancing the development of efficient and sustainable materials, which could be played a key role in enabling the clean hydrogen generation and contribute significantly to the ongoing efforts to establish a hydrogen-based energy system.</description>

                IrO2 is the benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, the high cost and low earth abundance hinder its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, surface&#8208;segregated IrCo nanoparticles on CoO nanosheets with a strong electronic interaction are synthesized through the ion exchange&#8208;pyrolysis method. The resulting IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures, containing an ultra&#8208;low Ir content of 4.73 wt %, demonstrate exceptional performance in the acidic OER. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and remarkable stability, with noticeable activity decay observed only after 140 hours of continuous operation. These results surpass most reported Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Specifically, the mass activity at the overpotential of 300 mV for the IrCo&#8208;CoO catalyst reaches 124.52 mA mgIr&#8208;1, which is 20 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, we constructed a home&#8208;made overall water splitting cell utilizing IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures as both anode and cathode electrodes, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.51 V. Our findings present a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficient catalysts with significantly reduced noble metals loading.</description>

      <title>Engineering Durable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers through Suppressed Electrochemical Corrosion of a NiFe&#8211;Graphitic Carbon Shell Anode Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02696</link>

                Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract This work utilizes defect engineering, heterostructure, pyridine N&#8208;doping, and carbon supporting to enhance cobalt&#8208;nickel selenide microspheres' performance in the oxygen electrode reaction. Specifically, microspheres mainly composed of CoNiSe 2 and Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction rich in selenium vacancies (V Se&#183; ) wrapped with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC) are prepared by Ar/NH 3 radio frequency plasma etching technique. The synthesized p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC shows high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance (half&#8208;wave potential (E 1/2 ) = 0.878 V and limiting current density (J L ) = 21.88 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The J L exceeds the 20 wt% Pt/C (19.34 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and the E 1/2 is close to the 20 wt% Pt/C (0.881 V). It also possesses excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (overpotential of 324 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), which even exceeds that of the commercial RuO 2 (427 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The density functional theory calculation indicates that the enhancement of ORR performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of plasma&#8208;induced V Se&#183; and the CoNiSe 2 &#8208;Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction. The p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC electrode assembled Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) show a peak power density of 138.29 mW cm &#8722;2 , outperforming the 20 wt% Pt/C+RuO 2 (73.9 mW cm &#8722;2 ) and other recently reported catalysts. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB delivers a high peak power density of 64.83 mW cm &#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;robust cycling stability even under bending.</description>

      <title>Sulfidation of Iron - Based Nanomaterial as Catalyst for Water Splitting Using Hydrothermal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.59188/jcs.v3i5.728</link>

                Consumption of fossil fuels causes greenhouse effect and global warming, hence the need for renewable energy sources that are environmentally friendly. Hydrogen is one of the abundant elements on earth. Hydrogen refers to a clean and renewable energy source, hydrogen can be a good choice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One way to produce hydrogen is by electrochemical water splitting. This study aims to determine the characterization of iron-based nanomaterials (iron sulfide - iron hydroxide) as a water splitting catalyst in general. Iron sulfide synthesis was carried out using hydrothermal sulfidation method for 6 hours at 80 oC with nickel foam as substrate. Synthesis of iron sulfide varying the concentration of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (0.0125 M, 0.025 M, 0.05 M and 0.1 M) produced brownish yellow to blackish grey colored samples. Characterization results using XRD showed that iron sulfide peaks were detected at higher concentrations of sodium sulfide nonahydrate. Based on the results of analyzing iron hydroxide using SEM, it is known that the sample is in the form of nano walls and on iron sulfide, it is known that the sample is in the form of nanoscale particles. Based on electrochemical measurement results, iron hydroxide can be a good catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with commercial Pt/C. The overpotential of iron hydroxide is smaller than Pt/C, which is only 15 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm2 and iron sulfide can be a good catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with electrocatalytic measurement results close to commercial RuO2. This is indicated by the small overpotential (260 mV at current densisty 10 mA/cm2 and small tafel slope (51 mV/dec).</description>

                The in situ confinement of nickel (Ni)&#8208;iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer&#8208;derived micro&#8208;/mesoporous silicon carboxynitride (Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N)&#8208;based support is investigated to stimulate superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in an alkaline media. Firstly, we consider a commercial polysilazane (PSZ) and Ni and Fe salts to be mixed together in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in order to prepare a series of Ni&#8208;Fe:organosilicon coordination complexes. The latter are then heat&#8208;treated at 500 &#176;C in flowing argon to form the title compounds. By considering a Ni:Fe ratio of 1.5, face centred cubic (fcc) NixFey alloy NPs with a size of 15&#8208;30 nm are in situ generated in a micro&#8208;/mesoporous Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N&#8208;based support displaying a specific surface area (SSA) as high as 237 m2&#8901;g&#8208;1. Hence, NPs are renderedaccessible to promote electrocatalytic water oxidation. An OER overpotential as low as 315 mV at 10 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 is measured. This high catalytic performance (considering that the metal mass loading is as low as 0.24 mg cm&#8722;2) is rather stable as observed after an activation step; thus, validating our synthesis approach and opening further investigations. This is clearly attributed to both the strong NP&#8208;matrix interaction and the confinement effect of the matrix as highlighted through post mortem microscopy observations.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Electrochemical Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural on a Thin-Film Ni Anode</title>

                The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is being explored as a favorable substitute for the oxygen evolution reaction owing to its capability to generate high-value products and lower overpotentials. Herein, we present a systematic investigation into the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a model biomass platform chemical, on a thin-film nickel catalyst, aiming to investigate the underlying reaction mechanism and shed light on the role of the catalyst's microenvironment and phase on activity and product selectivity. Utilizing a combined experimental and computational approach, we demonstrate that NiOOH is the active phase for HMF oxidation. Additionally, we find a substantial impact of the electrochemical environment, particularly the electrolyte pH, on the reaction. Under highly alkaline conditions (pH = 13), higher activity for HMF oxidation is observed, accompanied by an increased selectivity toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) production. Conversely, a less alkaline environment (pH = 11) results in diminished HMF oxidation activity and a higher preference for the partial oxidation product 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). Mechanistic insights from DFT studies reveal that geminal diols that are present under highly alkaline conditions undergo hydride transfer via HMFCA, while a shift to an alkoxide route occurs at a lower pH, favoring the DFF pathway. Hydride transfer energetics are also strongly affected by the surface Ni oxidation state. This integrated approach, bridging experimental and computational insights, provides a general framework for investigating the electrochemical oxidation of aldehydes and alcohols, thereby advancing rational design strategies in electrocatalysts for alcohol electro-oxidation reactions.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Ions Synergistic Bilayer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Pillared MXene Directing In Situ Ordered Embedding Growth of Highly Efficient NiFe Alloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202408303</link>
      <description>Zhongjie Qiu, Jiayan Wu, Baolin Zhang, Hui&#8208;Hua Song, Zhiming Cui, Zhenxing Liang, Li Du, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399764220

                Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi&#8208;directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano&#8208;hybrid material (NiFe/MX&#8208;HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX&#8208;HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene&#8208;based heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Innovative Insights into Water-Oxidation Mechanism: Investigating Birnessite&#8217;s Reaction with Cerium(IV) Ammonium Nitrate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c01461</link>

                Developing Mn-based water-oxidation reaction (WOR) catalysts is key for renewable energy storage, utilizing Mn's abundance, cost-effectiveness, and natural role. Cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) has been widely utilized as a sacrificial oxidant in the exploration of WOR catalysts. In this study, advanced techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), to delve into the WOR facilitated by CAN and birnessite were employed. XANES analysis has demonstrated that the average oxidation states (AOSs) of Mn in birnessite, a birnessite/CAN mixture, and in the birnessite/CAN mixture postwater addition are 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy performed in the presence of birnessite and CAN revealed a distinct peak at 784 cm&#8211;1, which is attributed to Mn(IV)&#9552;O. A shift of this peak to 769 cm&#8211;1 in H218O confirms its association with Mn(IV)&#9552;O. No change in this peak was observed in D2O, further supporting the notion that it is linked to Mn(IV)&#9552;O rather than Mn&#8211;OH (D). Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy shows the presence of Mn(IV). It is suggested that the WOR mechanism initiates with the oxidation of birnessite by CAN, which enhances the concentration of Mn(IV) sites in the birnessite structure. Under acidic conditions, birnessite, enriched in Mn(IV), facilitates oxygen evolution and subsequently transitions into a form with reduced Mn(IV) levels. This process highlights the critical function of the Mn (hydr)oxide structure, similar to its role in the water-oxidizing complex of Photosystem II, where it serves as charge storage for oxidizing equivalents from CAN, paving the way for a four-electron reaction that drives the WOR.</description>

                Oxygenic photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all biomass production on Earth, and may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of multicellular life. Life has evolved to perform photosynthesis under a wide range of illumination conditions, but with a common basic architecture of a light-harvesting antenna system coupled to a photochemical reaction centre. Using a general thermodynamic model of energy capture and diffusion in the antennae, coupled with a genetic algorithm to model their evolution, we reproduce qualitatively the antenna structures of multiple types of oxygenic photoautotrophs, including pigment composition, the linear absorption profile and the macrostructural topology, suggesting that the same simple physical principles underlie the development of distinct light-harvesting structures in various photosynthetic organisms. We finally apply our model to extra-solar light-environments and comment on the relative viability of both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis on exoplanets orbiting other types of stars.</description>

                Abstract This chapter examines how networks of cooperating and competing species can reach a flexible stability, simultaneously remaining stable while retaining the ability to evolve in many directions. Cooperation among species alone cannot explain this, because such cooperation can only evolve if it makes the participating species, acting as a unit, better overall competitors in the larger ecosystem. We explore how these continually shifting cooperative and competitive interactions can result in a flexible, rather than an ossified, stable state. Remarkable new adaptations are free to appear, along with avenues for other members of the ecosystems to adapt to them. Such ecosystem flexibility explains the history of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. This system, on which almost all of Earth&#8217;s life now depends, began its evolution as types of more-limited anoxygenic photosynthesis in two bacterial lineages. Gene transfers brought these photosynthetic mechanisms together in a third bacterial lineage. There, they evolved cooperative interactions that allowed them to use carbon dioxide and water to generate chemical energy and release gaseous oxygen as a &#8220;waste&#8221; product. This did not result in the immediate death of all anaerobic organisms that were sensitive to oxygen, however. We explore why, in spite of the overwhelming advantage of oxygenic photosynthesis, it took two billion years for oxygenic photosynthetic organisms to fully take over the planet. This was because ecosystems still had many routes by which their species could adapt to this new selective factor, slowing its advance and increasing life&#8217;s complexity and flexibility at the same time.</description>

      <title>Structure and Reactivity of Active Oxygen Species on Silver Surfaces for Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01566</link>

                The epoxidation of ethylene stands as one of the most important industrial catalytic reactions, and silver-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity. Oxygen is activated on the surface of silver during the reaction and exerts a substantial impact on product selectivity. Notably, the oxygen species residing in the topmost atomic layers profoundly influence the reactivity of a catalyst. However, their characterization under in situ reaction conditions remains a huge challenge, and specific structures have not been identified yet. In this study, we employ in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to determine the oxygen species formed at the topmost atomic layers of a silver foil and to assign them a structure. Three different groups of oxygen species activated on silver are identified: (i) surface lattice oxygen and two oxygen species originating from associatively adsorbed dioxygen and (ii) top and (iii) subsurface oxygen. Transient in situ photoelectron spectroscopy experiments are carried out to reveal the dynamic evolution and thus reactivity of the different oxygen species under ethylene epoxidation reaction environments. The top oxygen atom from the adsorbed associated dioxygen is the most active. Meanwhile, a frequency-selective data analysis method, developed to process time-resolved data, provides insights into the evolving trends of peak intensities for different oxygen species. The versatility of this method suggests its potential application in future time-resolved characterization studies.</description>

                Rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes affects the performance of a semiconductor device and limits the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. The use of an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers is a feasible approach to achieve high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Therefore, we synthesized a three-dimensional S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4) and investigated its activity in photocatalytic water splitting. An analysis of the band structure (XPS, UPS, and Mott&#8211;Schottky) indicated effective interfacial charge transfer in an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction composed of two n-type semiconductors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirmed that the light-induced charge transfer followed the S-scheme mechanism. Based on the capture test (EPR) of &#8226;OH free radicals, it can be seen that the enhanced activity is attributed to the S-scheme carrier migration mechanism in heterojunction, which promotes the rapid adsorption of H+ by the abundant amino sites in g-C3N4, thus effectively generating H2. The 2D/2D LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4 heterojunction has a good interface and produces a built-in electric field, improving the separation of e&#8211; and h+ while increasing the oxygen vacancy. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure and oxygen vacancy makes the photocatalyst significantly better than LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and g-C3N4 in visible light. The hydrogen evolution rate of the composite catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) was 34.50 mmol&#183;h&#8211;1&#183;g&#8211;1, which was 40.6 times and 9.2 times higher than that of the catalysts (LaNiO3 and g-C3N4), respectively. After 25 h of cyclic testing, the catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) composite material still exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution performance and photostability. It was confirmed that the synergistic effect between abundant active sites, enriched oxygen vacancies, and 2D/2D heterojunctions improved the photoinduced carrier separation and the light absorption efficiency of visible light. This study opens up new possibilities for the logical design of efficient photodecomposition using 2D/2D heterojunctions combined with oxygen vacancies.</description>

                Because of its environmental and intrinsic benefits, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using electrocatalysts has garnered significant attention. Engineering on the surface is commonly utilized to improve electrocatalytic activity by introducing atomic defects. In this study, we have developed a successful strategy to promote nitrogen activation by introducing oxygen vacancies into BiFeO3 perovskite. BiFeO3 with oxygen vacancies (denoted as VO-BiFeO3) possesses a high NH3 yield rate (89.3 &#956;g h-1 mgcat-1) and Faradaic efficiency (FE) (13.5%) at -0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of oxygen vacancies increases the binding capacity for nitrogen immobilization and reduces the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of NRR. Moreover, the analysis of the thermodynamic limiting potentials towards N2 reduction and H2 evolution demonstrates that VO-BiFeO3 has a higher selectivity for NRR than pristine BiFeO3.</description>

                The Front Cover graphic illustrates the process of hydrogen evolution during water splitting through electrocatalysis, highlighting the functionality of cationically engineered bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles (NPs). In their Research Article, Astita Dubey, Ignacio Sanju&#225;n, and co-workers explain that the electrocatalytic activity of Mn-doped BFO NPs undergoes a transformative shift as a consequence of mono-, di-, and tri-valent cation substitution for hydrogen evolution. Unlocking the potential of Mn-doped BFO NPs: enhancing hydrogen evolution activity through cationic substitutions at the Bi site. A lower kinetic overpotential for codoped BFO NPs was found. Why? It&#8242;s all about reducing charge transfer resistance, boosting surface area, and introducing novel active sites through various valent dopants. With a unique morphology, varied pore sizes, and bonus features like optimum surface defects and oxygen vacancies, contribute to reducing kinetic overpotential.

                Prebiotic pre-Darwinian reactions continued throughout biochemical or Darwinian evolution. Early chemical processes could have occurred on Earth between 4.5 and 3.6 billion years ago when cellular life was about to come into being. Pre-Darwinian evolution assumes the development of hereditary elements but does not regard them as self-organizing processes. The presence of biochemical self-organization after the pre-Darwinian evolution did not justify distinguishing between different types of evolution. From the many possible solutions, evolution selected from among those stable reactions that led to catalytic networks, and under gradually changing external conditions produced a reproducible, yet constantly evolving and adaptable, living system. Major abiotic factors included sunlight, precipitation, air, minerals, soil and the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Abiotic sources of chemicals contributed to the formation of prebiotic RNA, the development of genetic RNA, the RNA World and the initial life forms on Earth and the transition of genRNA to the DNA Empire, and eventually to the multitude of life forms today. The transition from the RNA World to the DNA Empire generated new processes such as oxygenic photosynthesis and the hierarchical arrangement of processes involved in the transfer of genetic information. The objective of this work is to unite earlier work dealing with the formose, the origin and synthesis of ribose and RNA reactions that were published as a series of independent reactions. These reactions are now regarded as the first metabolic pathway.</description>

                One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode planetary compositional signatures. This makes it imperative to perform a large chemical survey not only of the planets, but their host stars as well. This work is aimed at providing homogeneous chemical abundances for C, N, and O among a sample of 181 stars belonging to Tier 1 of the Ariel mission candidate sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators ( C i lines at 5052 and 5380.3 O i forbidden line at 6300.3 C _2$ bands at 5128 and 5165 and CN band at 4215 using high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra collected with a range of spectrographs. We determined carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analysed the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution and in terms of the planetary companion properties. We find that our sample essentially follows standard trends with respect to the metallicity values expected for the C/Fe N/Fe and O/Fe abundance ratios. The proportion between carbon and oxygen abundances (both yields of primary production) is consistent with a constant ratio as O/H increases. Meanwhile, the abundance of nitrogen tends to increase with the increasing of the oxygen abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The C/N C/O and N/O abundance ratios are also correlated with Fe/H which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories when host stars of different metallicities are compared. Finally, we provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched (or otherwise) with respect to the host stars.</description>

                Abstract Space micropump are an important component of the on-orbit refuelling system. The gas-liquid behaviour transition induced by dissolved and released processes in the micropump has obtained considerable attention. Our proposed mathematical model achieved the bidirectional dissolved-released processes in an on-orbit space micropump for the first time. The performance characteristics of the micropump and the mathematical computational model used by the plug-discharge flow have been validated. Herein, the correlated mechanism between the flow, mass transfer and solution status were analysed. Under the pressurization of the micropump impeller, the gas was constantly dissolved into the solution, and the higher concentration caused the gas to evolve from the solution. The oxygen increment decreased rapidly when the initial dissolved oxygen centration exceeded 23 mg/L because of the gas evolution occurred. Focused on this sudden decreasing state of oxygen increment from 23 to 24 mg/L, four concentration conditions were discussed in depth including flow field, oxygen increment and mass transfer rate. In the impeller, the equilibrium concentration increases controlled by the pressure was obviously larger than the increase of the real-time concentration; thus, the unidirectional absorbed processes occurred inside the impeller. Two near-rate mass-transfer band were found near the short blades, exhibiting the dynamic equilibrium characteristic. Moreover, affected by the strong disturbance of the impeller outlet, the mass transfer rate was the highest here.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is commonly regarded as a sustainable and clean method to generate hydrogen and oxygen, which is deemed to be efficient for the utilization of renewable energy. Electrocatalysts are essential components to enhance electrochemical efficiency and optimize product yield. Hollow micro/nanostructures possess large specific surface areas, multiple voids, and tunable chemical compositions, making them suitable for use as direct catalysts or as supports for electrochemical reactions. This review summarizes recent advancements in structural and functional designs of micro/nanostructured hollow materials as electrocatalysts for an enhanced water-splitting process. We emphasize ideas and strategies to create various hollow electrocatalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution processes. Subsequently, a comprehensive summary of recent studies on hollow borides, carbides, oxides, phosphides, selenides, sulfides, alloys, MXenes, and various heterostructured electrocatalysts containing hollow hosts is provided. Furthermore, we highlight the current challenges and perspectives of hollow micro/nanostructures for electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Seawater oxygen isotopes as a tool for monitoring future meltwater from the Antarctic ice-sheet</title>

      <description>Hyuna Kim, Axel Timmermann, Communications earth &amp; environment. 5(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399921048

                Abstract To reduce uncertainties in future sea level projections, it is necessary to closely monitor the evolution of the Antarctic ice-sheet. Here, we show that seawater oxygen isotopes are an effective tool to monitor ice-sheet freshwater discharge and its contributions to sea level rise. Using the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model with imposed estimates of future meltwater fluxes, we find that the anthropogenic ice-sheet signal in water isotopes emerges above natural variability decades earlier than salinity-based estimates. The superiority of seawater isotopes over salinity in detecting the ice-sheet melting can be attributed to the higher signal-to-noise ratio of the former and the fact that future sea ice changes only contribute little to seawater isotopes but a lot to salinity. We conclude that in particular in the Ross Sea sector, continuous seawater oxygen isotope measurements could serve as an early warning system for rapid anthropogenic Antarctic ice-sheet mass loss.</description>

      <title>Fast Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Singlet Oxygen-Engaged Sequential Excitation Energy and Electron-Transfer Process</title>

                Sequential excitation energy and electron transfer (ET) are ubiquitous pathways for converting solar energy to chemical energy in photosynthesis. Mimicking this unique process for chemical synthesis is promising yet still a big challenge. Herein, taking photosynthesis as an inspiration, we demonstrate an interesting pathway for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important and valuable commodity chemical. The proposed route was verified on a biomimetic photocatalyst, i.e., an aluminum porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheet (Al&#8211;TCPP). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the dioxygen molecule is first converted to a highly active singlet oxygen intermediate through an excitation energy transfer (EET) and then reduced to H2O2 via the photogenerated electrons with a reduced barrier over Al&#8211;TCPP. Consequently, Al&#8211;TCPP shows a 32 times higher H2O2 evolution rate than that of the pristine TCPP counterpart, wherein excitation energy transfer mainly exists. This study presents a paradigm to mimic the photosynthetic sequential excitation energy and electron-transfer process for improved synthesis of valuable commodity chemicals.</description>

                Abstract Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li 2 O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which could show fast Li + diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and non&#8208;uniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li 2 O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, we successfully prepared CoO x embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoO x ) as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18 O isotope labeling, we aimed to elucidate the role of CoO x during SEI evolution that CoO x contributes significantly to Li 2 O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li 2 O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li + migration kinetics, and therefore the CNF&#8208;CoO x @Li anode could exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

      <title>Local Environment and Migration Paths of the Proton Defect in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Studied by Ab Initio Calculations and Muon-Spin Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>A. G. Marinopoulos, R. C. Vil&#227;o, H. V. Alberto, J. M. Gil, R. B. L. Vieira, J. S. Lord, Hydrogen. 5(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399958935

                The local binding and migration behavior of the proton defect in cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is studied by first-principles calculations and muon-spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) measurements. The calculations are based on density-functional theory (DFT) supplemented with a hybrid-functional approach with the proton defect embedded in quasi-random supercells of 10.3 mol% yttria content, where the yttrium&#8211;zirconium substitutional defects are charge compensated by oxygen vacancies. Representative migration pathways for the proton comprising both transfer and bond reorientation modes are analysed and linked to the underlying microstructure of the YSZ lattice. The &#956;SR data show the evolution of the diamagnetic fraction corresponding to the muon-isotope analogue with an activation energy of diffusion equal to 0.17 eV. Comparisons between the calculations and the experiment allow an assessment of the character of the short-range migration of the proton particle in cubic YSZ.</description>

      <title>Stable isotope revealed hydroclimate transition and topography growth in the Northern Tibetan Plateau at ~ 10 Ma</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112341</link>

                The Middle to Late Miocene uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau had been revealed in a large amount of studies, however, its effects on hydrological and climatic evolution in Asia remains unclear due to the lack of well dated direct hydrological records in this region. Here, we report a carbonate oxygen isotope record (&#948;18Oc) from the western Qaidam Basin, and compare it with the &#948;18Oc records of five different basins in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. These data reconstruct the hydroclimatic evolution in this region and show a divergence of &#948;18Oc variation pattern in different basins at &#8764;11.5&#8211;8.5 Ma, which is different with a consistent evolution pattern of them before and after this time interval. This divergence is characterized by a significant decrease of &#948;18Oc in the windward locations while an increase in the leeward locations. This &#948;18Oc divergence was decoupling with the concurrent stable global climate, but consistent with the contemporaneous uplift of the northern Tibetan plateau. This suggests a possible link between &#948;18Oc divergence and topographic growth, which is further supported by a &#8764; 1000 m paleoelevation increase revealed by our &#948;18Oc paleoelevation reconstruction. We suggest that the topography growth of the northern Tibetan Plateau especially the surrounding mountains would have facilitated water vapor transport to the windward regions, resulting in isotopic depletion in the water vapor masses. Whilst, a blocking of water vapor masses would induce aridity and increased evaporation in the leeward slopes, thus enriching heavy isotopes in precipitation there. This study corroborates the extensive uplift of the Northern Tibetan Plateau during &#8764;11.5&#8211;8.5 Ma from an isotopic perspective. A comparison of the obtained &#948;18Oc records with modern ones further suggests an establishment of modern hydroclimatic patterns in northern Tibetan Plateau at &#8764;8.5 Ma.</description>

      <title>Oxygen and sulfur stable isotope ratios of Late Devonian vertebrates trace the relative salinity of their aquatic environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1130/b37631.1</link>

Daeschler, Romain Amiot, Fran&#231;ois Fourel, S&#233;bastien Olive, Arnauld Vin&#231;on&#8208;Laugier, Christophe L&#233;cuyer, &#152;The &#156;Geological Society of America bulletin/Geological Society of America bulletin.

                Late Devonian aquatic environments hosted the fin-to-limb transition in vertebrates. Upper Devonian (ca. 365&#8722;360 Ma) strata in Pennsylvania, USA, preserve a diversity of fishes and tetrapods in coastal marine to fluvial depositional environments, making this region ideal for investigating the ecology and evolution of Late Devonian vertebrates. A key unresolved issue has been reconstructing the specific aquatic habitats that hosted various vertebrates during this period. Specifically, the salinity of environments spanning fresh to shallow marine water is difficult to discern from sedimentological and paleontological analyses alone. Here, we analyze rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) as well as stable oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (&#948;18O, &#948;34S) in fossil vertebrate bioapatite from late Famennian (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma) strata of the Catskill and Lock Haven formations in the Appalachian Basin, USA, to determine the relative salinity of their aquatic environments. These results confirm the ecological euryhalinity of several taxa (Bothriolepis sp., tristichopterids, and Holoptychius sp.). Our results are the first demonstrating that some early tetrapod species occupied unequivocally freshwater habitats by late Famennian time (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma). Our study shows that integrating sedimentological and paleontological data with combined oxygen and sulfur isotope analysis allows precise tracing of the relative salinity of vertebrate habitats deep in the past.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Formation Conditions of Uranus and Neptune from their
  Deep Elemental Compositions</title>

                This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide iceline within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO iceline is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5-1 times their protosolar ratios. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.</description>

      <title>Initial Results of our Spectro-photometric Monitoring of XZ Tau</title>

                We present here initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau. During our monitoring period, XZ Tau exhibited several episodes of brightness variations in timescales of months at optical wavelengths in contrast to the mid-infrared wavelengths. The color evolution of XZ Tau during this period suggests that the brightness variations are driven by changes in accretion from the disc. The mid-infrared light curve shows an overall decline in brightness by &#8764; 0.5 and 0.7 magnitude respectively in WISE W1 (3.4 &#956;m) and W2 (4.6 &#956;m) bands. The emission profile of the hydrogen recombination lines along with that of Ca II IRT lines points towards magnetospheric accretion of XZ Tau. We have detected P Cygni profile in H&#946; indicating of out-flowing winds from regions close to accretion. Forbidden transitions of oxygen are also detected, likely indicating jets originating around the central pre-main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Detached eddy simulation of the interaction between acoustics and flame dynamics during the transition before and after longitudinal thermoacoustic instability in a multi-element liquid rocket engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0212762</link>
      <description>Yuanzhe Liu, Zhuopu Wang, Wen Ao, Yu Guan, Peijin Liu, Physics of fluids. 36(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399888075

                In this study, we present the first numerical evidence of multiple bifurcation processes occurring in a multi-element model liquid rocket engine before and after the longitudinal thermoacoustic instability regime, as we vary the oxidizer inlet temperature within the range of 400&#8211;1400 K. To accurately capture the non-premixed turbulent combustion process, a comprehensive three-dimensional compressible detached eddy algorithm was employed, incorporating a two-step methane/oxygen chemical reaction kinetic mechanism based on OpenFOAM. After validating the numerical framework and achieving grid independence, we focus on (1) investigating the transition routes of system dynamics and (2) analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of multiple jet combustion flow fields during the multi-bifurcation process. Our results indicate that the system dynamics undergoes two successive bifurcating processes. During the first bifurcation (400 K &#8804; T &#8804; 800 K), the system dynamics transitions into a full period-1 oscillation through intermittency. In the second bifurcation (1200 K &#8804; T &#8804; 1400 K), the system shifts from a limit cycle state back to a combustion noise state. The complex coupling mechanism between injectors is further elucidated through frequency spectrum results of radial velocity and temperature near the initial shear layer in the wakes of different injectors, especially the symmetry-breaking response between different injector jets. The analysis of snapshots and flame index also reveals the spatiotemporal evolution of combustion flow fields, specifically highlighting vortex dynamics, heat release, and combustion modes that potentially contribute to thermoacoustic instability.</description>

                Temperature is the most important abiotic factor and has a direct influence on the physiology of the organism, affecting nearly all other parameters of the living environment of organisms. Ectothermic organisms are highly endangered in the current crisis climate, as they are unable to use metabolic heat to maintain body temperature. Reptiles are ectothermic vertebrates that are also susceptible to temperature fluctuations. Metabolism, muscle and nervous system function and reproduction are closely linked to reptile body temperature. To study the effects of temperature on oxidative stress, it is necessary to describe the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and how organisms can prevent oxidative stress. This article describes the oxidation-antioxidation processes and the oxidative stress caused by thermal effects in reptiles. In the metabolic processes of aerobic organisms, ROS are continuously generated as by-products of oxidation-reduction reactions and are not primarily harmful. Furthermore, ROS are essential for many physiological functions, e.g., for energy production and for processes in the immune system. The potential toxicity of reactive oxygen radicals under physiological conditions is prevented by the antioxidant defence system. Oxidativestress occurs when the balance between oxidation and antioxidation systems is disturbed by excessive amounts of ROS or by the depletion of antioxidants. It is known that the metabolic rate of reptiles correlates with environmental temperature, making them physiologically more sensitive to temperature fluctuations compared to mammals. However, it must be considered that ectothermic organisms have evolved many thermal adaptations through physiological and behavioural measures to mitigate the resulting oxidative stress. However, further research in the fields of ecology, biogeography and evolution is needed to determine the exact effects of temperature on oxidative stress and the resulting changes in life characteristics in wild populations.</description>

      <title>Stability and Redox Mechanisms of Ni-Rich NMC Cathodes: Insights from First-Principles Many-Body Calculations</title>

                Ni-rich LiNiaMnbCocO2 (NMC) cathodes undergo a series of degradation reactions, a prominent one being oxygen loss from the surface of the NMC particles; this process is more pronounced as Ni content is increased and at high voltages. Our first-principles study examines the redox behavior of transition metals (TMs) and O in Ni-rich NMC cathodes as a function of (de)lithiation. We use ab initio multiple scattering, density-functional theory (DFT)-based core-loss spectroscopy, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to give a many-body treatment of both dynamic and static correlations. Despite Ni, Mn, and Co K-edges calculated using ab initio multiple scattering based on Green's functions showing an excellent match with experimentally obtained X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES), we demonstrate that the ionic model of ascribing shifts in the XANES spectra to changes in metal oxidation states is inappropriate. We show that in these cases, which are characterized by strong covalency between the TM and oxygen, DMFT calculations based on Wannier projections are to date to the best of our knowledge the most accurate as well as computationally accessible method to calculate charges and hence assign oxidation states accurately. Due to the corresponding charge transfer from O p to Ni d, a ligand hole forms on O in Ni-rich regions. The individual Ni charge remains fairly constant throughout the charging/discharging process, particularly in Ni-rich environments in the material. In contrast, O has dual redox behavior, showing greater involvement in redox in Ni-rich regions while showing negligible redox involvement in Ni-poor regions. The Ni&#8211;O covalent system starts participating in redox around a state of delithiation of &#8764;17%, which represents, in our system, the beginning of the charge. Contrary to previous DFT calculations, we show that Co oxidation does not occur at the very end of charge but rather starts at an earlier state of delithiation of &#8764;67%. The dual behavior of O in terms of participation in the redox process helps explain the overall higher relative stability of lower Ni content NMCs compared to Ni-rich NMCs or LiNiO2 in terms of O loss and evolution of singlet oxygen.</description>

                Abstract We use variable temperature and magnetic field total x-ray scattering to study the crystal structure in the strongly correlated Pr 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3 perovskite, which is a paramagnetic insulator (PMI) at room temperature, becomes a ferromagnetic metal (FMM) at 272 K and, upon further decreasing the temperature, turns into an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) at 105 K. We find that a model featuring a monoclinic symmetry captures the structure and its temperature and field evolution well, eliminating the need to evoke a phase segregation scenario as done in prior studies. It appears that coupled deviations in Mn-oxygen bonding distances and angles from their values in an undistorted perovskite lattice, i.e., coupled local lattice distortions, drive the phase transitions in Pr 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3 , endowing it with unique physical properties. Local structural distortions thus emerge as an important degree of freedom in strongly correlated systems, in particular perovskite manganates, and, therefore, they should be fully accounted for when their fascinating physics is considered.</description>

                Metal oxide has been considered as promising support to regulate the active microenvironment of noble metals to promote the catalytic performance, but they suffer from unsatisfactory electrical resistance and poor stability. Herein, ultrafast quasi-solid microwave (60 s) is employed to achieve phosphorous-doped black TiO2 supported Ru (Ru/P-TiO2) with d-band center modulation to optimize the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-synthesized Ru/P-TiO2 exhibits extraordinary HER activities in alkaline fresehwater/seawater electrolytes with overpotential of 43 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 coupled with satisfactory stability. Experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculation clarify that the achieved Ru/P-TiO2 owns optimal d-band center for H* adsorption. Moreover, the phosphorous doping enhanced the electronic interactions between Ru and oxygen vacancy-enriched TiO2 to optimize the reaction kinetics and enhance the stability. This work provides promising strategy to modulate the metal oxide matrix for designing novel catalysts on energy conversion and storage applications.</description>

                New N,O-hybrid ligands with methylene fragment between coordinating nitrogen and oxygen donor centers namely, dialkyl(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxides and dialkyl(quinoline-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxides were synthesized. During complexation with MnCl2 pyridyl-containing dialkylphosphine oxides act as chelating N,O-bidentate ligands, while quinoline-containing dialkylphosphine oxide acts as O-monodentate ligand. All compounds were structurally characterized by mass-spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, the monocrystal and powder X-ray analyses. The photoluminescence, electrochemical properties and cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds were studied. It was found that obtained ligands and their manganese(II) complexes exhibit green&#8211;blue and blue-violet luminescence. High catalytic activity of manganese(II) complex with diisopropyl(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxide in HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) was found. Manganese(II) complexes based on pyridyl-containing phosphine oxides demonstrate high cytotoxic activity towards HuTu80 cancer cell line.</description>

                One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.</description>

                We present a study of three highly non-radial solar wind events in which the azimuthal solar wind flow angle exceeds 6&#176; for one day or more. None of the events are associated with coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions observed at 1 AU. For all events, the solar wind outflows at 1 AU exhibit low velocity and density. Based on the significant increase in the oxygen charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ at 1 AU for all of the events, we have traced them back to the Sun and found that their source regions originated in active region and coronal hole (AR-CH) pairs mainly located at the central meridian. Furthermore, examining the dynamical evolutions in their source regions using both the Extreme ultra-violet Imaging Telescope and the Michelson Doppler Imager, we found that the changes taking place in AR-CH boundaries eventually disturbed the stable CH configurations, resulting in a reduction of the CH area and finally its disappearance, leaving only with the AR. Our study provides a possible explanation for discussing the origin of the prolonged and highly non-radial solar wind flows.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Crystallization-driven Convection in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4152</link>
      <description>Matias Castro-Tapia, Andrew Cumming, J. R. Fuentes, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 969(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399890923

                Abstract We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon&#8211;oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally driven and compositionally driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally driven convection in a thermally stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, at the onset of crystallization, the composition flux is large enough to drive fast overturning convection for a short time (&#8764;10 Myr). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation</title>

                Hydrogenation is the process by which the universe's smallest and most abundant element, Hydrogen, passivates recombination active defects. Some form of hydrogenation is used in almost every solar cell ever made and in all record silicon cells. This chapter reviews the evolution of hydrogenation techniques and their pivotal role in solar cell technology. The fundamental properties of hydrogen are considered before a discussion of typical hydrogenation methods including forming gas anneals, "alneal" and hydrogen containing dielectrics with thermal activation. Such methods can provide very effective passivation of silicon surfaces and most grain boundaries. In more recent years, techniques to control the charge state of hydrogen have enabled greatly enhanced passivation of bulk defects such as boron-oxygen complexes. Known as "advanced hydrogenation", these processes optimise the temperature and Fermi level within the silicon via carrier injection to convert the hydrogen into more mobile and reactive charge states. Several commercial tools and processes exist to apply advanced hydrogenation processes to finished cells. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential negative effects of hydrogen where hydrogen itself interacts with the silicon lattice, other impurities, or defects to create new recombination active defects.</description>

      <title>Massive Interacting Binaries as an Enrichment Source for Multiple Populations in Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4a61</link>
      <description>Michelle Nguyen, Alison Sills, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 969(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399972766

                Abstract We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 &#8804; M 1 &#8804; 40 M &#8857; ) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo nonconservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning that are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher-order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.</description>

      <title>Level set simulation of focused ion beam sputtering of a multilayer substrate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3762/bjnano.15.61</link>
      <description>A. V. Rumyantsev, &#1053;. &#1048;. &#1041;&#1086;&#1088;&#1075;&#1072;&#1088;&#1076;&#1090;, &#1056;. &#1051;. &#1042;&#1086;&#1083;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;, Yu. A. Chaplygin, Beilstein journal of nanotechnology. 15(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399974448

                The evolution of a multilayer sample surface during focused ion beam processing was simulated using the level set method and experimentally studied by milling a silicon dioxide layer covering a crystalline silicon substrate. The simulation took into account the redeposition of atoms simultaneously sputtered from both layers of the sample as well as the influence of backscattered ions on the milling process. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to produce tabulated data on the angular distributions of sputtered atoms and backscattered ions. Two sets of test structures including narrow trenches and rectangular boxes with different aspect ratios were experimentally prepared, and their cross sections were visualized in scanning transmission electron microscopy images. The superimposition of the calculated structure profiles onto the images showed a satisfactory agreement between simulation and experimental results. In the case of boxes that were prepared with an asymmetric cross section, the simulation can accurately predict the depth and shape of the structures, but there is some inaccuracy in reproducing the form of the left sidewall of the structure with a large amount of the redeposited material. To further validate the developed simulation approach and gain a better understanding of the sputtering process, the distribution of oxygen atoms in the redeposited layer derived from the numerical data was compared with the corresponding elemental map acquired by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis.</description>

      <title>Properties evolution and damage mechanism of SiC/SiC composites after thermal shock at 1300&#176;C</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.06.263</link>

                SiC/SiC composites in aerospace applications are exposed to a variety of thermal conditions, in particular, thermal stress due to rapid heating and cooling. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate and evaluate the resistance of SiC/SiC composites to repeated temperature cycling. This paper investigates the evolution of properties and damage mechanisms of 2D and 2.5D SiC/SiC composites after different thermal shock cycles at 1300&#176;C. It was found that SiC/SiC composites exhibit a temporary weight increase at the beginning of the thermal shock cycle. Subsequently, the weight decreases and stabilizes as the number of thermal shocks increases. After 10-30 thermal shocks at 1300&#176;C, the density of SiC/SiC composites decreases while the porosity increases. The fracture behavior of SiC/SiC composites remains the same as that of the initial composites, with 2D SiC/SiC composites exhibiting pseudo-tough fracture and 2.5D SiC/SiC composites exhibiting brittle fracture. The residual strength of the SiC/SiC composites decreased slightly while the residual modulus remained stable. This is related to the reaction of the SiC, and BN with water and oxygen at high-temperature. The thermal shock damage of SiC/SiC composites is anisotropic and is influenced by the structure of the fiber preforms. This is due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the components within the composites and the structural properties of the fiber preforms.</description>

      <title>Spin Energy Contributions of the Kinetic Energy Density in the Stabilization of the Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c03334</link>
      <description>Pablo Carpio&#8208;Mart&#237;nez, David Ram&#237;rez-Palma, Fernando Cort&#233;s&#8208;Guzm&#225;n, &#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A/&#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A.. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399889771

                The kinetic energy (KE) density plays an essential role in the stabilization mechanism of covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bondings; however, its role in metal&#8211;ligand bindings remains unclear. In a recent work, the energetic contributions of the spin densities &#945; and &#946; were studied to explain the geometrical characteristics of a series of metal&#8211;ligand complexes. Notably, the KE density was found to modulate/stabilize the spin components of the intra-atomic nucleus&#8211;electron interactions within the metal in the complex. Here, we investigate the topographic properties of the spin components of the KE density for a family of high-spin hexa-aquo complexes ([M(H2O)6]2+) to shed light on the stabilization of the metal&#8211;ligand interaction. We compute the Lagrangian, G(r), and Hamiltonian, K(r), KE densities and analyze the evolution of its spin components in the formation of two metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes. We study K&#945;/&#946;(r) along the metal&#8211;oxygen (M&#8211;O) internuclear axis as a function of the metal. Our results indicate that K(r) is a more distance-sensitive quantity compared to G(r) as it displays topographic features at larger M&#8211;O distances. Furthermore, K(r) allows one to identify the predominant interaction mechanism in the complexes.</description>

      <title>Formation mechanism and control of a kind of pit-shaped defect in Cf53 rolled products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153273</link>
      <description>Kaimin Wang, Haiyan Tang, Huajun Wang, Xingyu Jia, Jiaquan Zhang, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399771554

                Aiming at the frequent issue of pit-shaped surface defects in S-bearing and Al-killed steel products and the related poor castability due to submerged entry nozzle (SEN) clogging, the melting and casting process of a popular auto steel Cf53 has been studied based on in-situ investigation and experimental analysis. To clarify the generation of the pit-shaped defects, the local surface chemistry, evolution of steel inclusions throughout the melting process, SEN clogging substances, and the internal relationship among them were systematically analyzed. The results show that this type of defect in the Cf53 rolled products is caused by the large-sized composite inclusions rich in CaS, which originate from the molten steel during the refining process, gradually accumulate on the inner wall of the SEN during casting, and finally lead to SEN clogging. The loose structure of clogging inclusions makes them prone to fall off into the mold and get trapped by solidifying steel shell. The formation mechanism of the inclusions was studied through FactSage software calculation. The results show that the increase in total sulfur and total calcium content, and the decrease in total oxygen content and temperature in steel will lead to CaS inclusion formation, which agrees reasonably well with experimental results. An optimized refining process to reduce calcium addition into molten steel is proposed accordingly, which achieves a remarkably alleviation in casting SEN clogging and an elimination of the pit-shaped defects on the final rolled products as well.</description>

                In the development of advanced energy saving technologies in the metallurgical industry, a comprehensive approach to managing energy flows is crucial. This article presents an in-depth analysis of the steelmaking and metallurgical industry in China and Russia, focusing on the evolution and current shortcomings of energy saving methods in metallurgical processes. The authors thoroughly analyze various technological processes, including sintering, coking, pellet production, iron production in blast furnaces, steel production in oxygen converters and electric arc furnaces, as well as steel rolling, identifying significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions. The main outcome of the research is the development of structural models of technological processes based on the concept of energy saving &#8220;temperature matching, cascade utilization, and global linkage&#8221;, covering key stages of steelmaking. These models provide detailed descriptions of the role and interrelation of each process within the complete metallurgical cycle and combine into a comprehensive structural model of steelmaking technological process. The model includes not only specific operations and characteristics of each stage but also explains how these processes interact and depend on each other, forming an integrated and interconnected system of metallurgical production. This model encompasses comprehensive temperature-pressure and production links, providing a theoretical basis for the development of mathematical models of energy saving and the design of corresponding computer applications. The structural model of steelmaking technological process is important for understanding and optimizing the entire process of metallurgical production, contributing to its energy and ecological efficiency.</description>

                Facile mass transport channel and accessible active sites is crucial for binder-free air electrode catalysts in rechargeable flexible zinc-air battery (ZAB). Herein, a ZnS/NH3 dual-assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to prepare N/S-doped hierarchical porous bamboo carbon cloth (HP-NS-BCC) as binder-free air electrode catalyst for ZAB. BCC fabric with abundant micropores is firstly used as flexible carbon support to facilitate the heteroatom-doping and construct the hierarchical porous structure. ZnS nanospheres and NH3 activization together facilitate the electronic modulation of carbon matrix by N/S-doping and optimize the macro/meso/micropores structure of carbon fibers. Benefiting from the highly-exposed N/S-induced sites with enhanced intrinsic activity, the optimized mass transport of biocarbon fibers, as well as the ultra-large specific surface area of 2436.1 m2 g-1, the resultant HP-NS-BCC catalyst exhibits improved kinetics for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. When applied to rechargeable aqueous ZABs, it achieves a high open-circuit voltage of 1.516 V and a significant peak power density of 249.1 mW cm&#8722;2. As binder-free air electrode catalyst, the flexible ZAB also displays stable cycling over 500 cycles with a minimal voltage gap of 0.42 V, showcasing promising applications in flexible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Gas phase composition of a NiMH battery during a work cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1039/d4ra02130d</link>
      <description>Aleksandra Lindberg, Bj&#246;rn Eriksson, Jenny B&#246;rjesson Ax&#233;n, Amritha P. Sandra, G&#246;ran Lindbergh, RSC advances. 14(28)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399910865

                Side reactions leading to gas evolution are undesirable in batteries and result in reduced coulombic efficiency and shortened lifetime. Quantitative analysis of the gases that evolve is therefore important to improve understanding of the reactions occurring in the battery during cycling and could be used to optimize battery operation. However, the measurements are challenging because batteries are by their nature closed with limited gas space. Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are widely used due to their good rate capability, reliability, and environmental friendliness. The battery type has been extensively studied in terms of degradation and performance. However, very few studies have been conducted on the gas composition created during a work cycle. In this study, two methods for investigating the internal NiMH battery gas phase composition during different charge/discharge cycles using a mass spectrometer (MS) were developed. In the first method, the battery module was connected by a sampler system. In the second method, the battery was connected directly using a microcapillary, and the gas composition was continuously measured. In addition to the gas composition, the voltage, pressure, and temperature of the battery were recorded. The most abundant component in the measured gas phase was nitrogen, present in the cell from the assembly stage, followed by hydrogen. A clear rising trend of hydrogen pressure as depth of charge (DOC) increased was recorded, while oxygen levels were low except around the end of charge. The methods were found to be a reliable means of investigating NiMH gas composition without negatively affecting the battery and may be adapted to other battery chemistries.</description>

                Visible light-driven photocatalytic water splitting has been considered one of the most promising sustainable approaches toward solar fuel production. As a substitute for metal oxide semiconductors, 2D graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) have been suffered a major challenge owing to its moderate bandgap (&#8764;2.8 eV) and the synergistic effect of using spinel metal ferrites with a narrow bandgap (&#8764;1.7 eV&#8211;1.9 eV) as a cocatalyst is promising to enhance solar energy conversion efficiency and stability. The as-synthesized gCN/copper ferrite (CFO) nanocomposites exhibit 10-fold augmentation in the photocurrent density (&#8764;5 &#956;A cm&#8722;2) compared with pure gCN. Remarkably, the gCN/CFO nanocomposites also exhibit 24 times increment in the rate of photocatalytic H2 evolution (&#8764;488 &#956;mol g&#8722;1) in contrast with pure gCN (&#8764;20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The amalgamation of gCN with metal ferrites has resulted in the development of direct Z-scheme heterojunction at the interface, facilitating the spatial separation of electrons and holes and boosting photocatalytic performance. Oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic efficacy of the nanocomposites, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Moreover, the as-synthesized composites are highly stable in structure and morphology under light irradiation without considerable reduction in the catalytic performance over several cycles. Therefore, this work presents a facile approach using metal ferrites as co-catalysts to develop graphitic carbon-nitride-based photocatalysts for solar light-assisted green fuel generation.</description>

                 BACKGROUND Research has demonstrated that hypoxia, a decrease in intracellular oxygen, is linked to multiple processes in the skin, including metabolic adaptation, cell survival, pathogenic microbe infection, immune response, tumorigenesis, and various diseases.   OBJECTIVE This paper aims to perform a thorough bibliometric analysis of studies of hypoxia in skin health and disease to identify the frontiers, hotspots, and evolution of these studies.   METHODS Articles about hypoxia in skin health and disease in the Web of Science Core Collection were gathered as of December 31, 2023. To find bursting keywords and references, VOSviewer was used to look at co-authorship and phrase co-occurrences and make visualizations of them.   RESULTS A total of 1,511 papers on hypoxia in skin health and disease were examined in this study. China, the United States, and Japan were the top three countries contributing to this topic, while the International Journal of Molecular Sciences was the journal with the most articles. In terms of prolific authors in the publications, Yuesheng Huang from China contributed the most articles. The terms "hypoxia," "angiogenesis," and "wound healing" were the ones that were used the most frequently. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was performed on the last ten years' worth of research on hypoxia in skin health and disease.   CONCLUSIONS The analysis identified the publications, nations, authors, institutions, and journals that were involved in this subject. These data offer a more comprehensive understanding of the area of research that has been conducted on hypoxia in skin health and disease. </description>

      <title>Fast, Efficient Tailoring Growth of Nanocrystalline Diamond Films by Fine-Tuning of Gas-Phase Composition Using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17122976</link>
      <description>Chi Tang, A.J.S. Fernandes, Margarida Fac&#227;o, Alexandre F. Carvalho, Weixia Chen, Haijun Hou, F.M. Costa, Materials. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399778914

                Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films are attractive for many applications due to their smooth surfaces while holding the properties of diamond. However, their growth rate is generally low using common Ar/CH4 with or without H2 chemistry and strongly dependent on the overall growth conditions using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). In this work, incorporating a small amount of N2 and O2 additives into CH4/H2 chemistry offered a much higher growth rate of NCD films, which is promising for some applications. Several novel series of experiments were designed and conducted to tailor the growth features of NCD films by fine-tuning of the gas-phase compositions with different amounts of nitrogen and oxygen addition into CH4/H2 gas mixtures. The influence of growth parameters, such as the absolute amount and their relative ratios of O2 and N2 additives; substrate temperature, which was adjusted by two ways and inferred by simulation; and microwave power on NCD formation, was investigated. Short and long deposition runs were carried out to study surface structural evolution with time under identical growth conditions. The morphology, crystalline and optical quality, orientation, and texture of the NCD samples were characterized and analyzed. A variety of NCD films of high average growth rates ranging from 2.1 &#956;m/h up to 6.7 &#956;m/h were successfully achieved by slightly adjusting the O2/CH4 amounts from 6.25% to 18.75%, while that of N2 was kept constant. The results clearly show that the beneficial use of fine-tuning of gas-phase compositions offers a simple and effective way to tailor the growth characteristics and physical properties of NCD films for optimizing the growth conditions to envisage some specific applications.</description>

      <title>Water/N,N-Dimethylacetamide-Based Hybrid Electrolyte and Its Application to Enhanced Voltage Electrochemical Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060213</link>
      <description>Aleksandra A. Mroziewicz, Karolina Solska, G. &#379;ukowska, Magdalena Skunik&#8208;Nuckowska, Batteries. 10(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399829928

                The growing interest in hybrid (aqueous&#8211;organic) electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage is due to their wide stability window, improved safety, and ease of assembly that does not require a moisture-free atmosphere. When it comes to applications in electrochemical capacitors, hybrid electrolytes are expected to fill the gap between high-voltage organic systems and their high discharge rate aqueous counterparts. This article discusses the potential applicability of aqueous&#8211;organic electrolytes utilizing water/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent mixture, and sodium perchlorate as a source of charge carriers. The hydrogen bond formation between H2O and DMAc (mole fraction xDMAc = 0.16) is shown to regulate the original water and cation solvation structure, thus reducing the electrochemical activity of the primary aqueous solution both in the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions region. As a result, an electrochemical stability window of 3.0 V can be achieved on titanium electrodes while providing reasonable ionic conductivity of 39 mS cm&#8722;1 along with the electrolyte&#8217;s flame retardant and anti-freezing properties. Based on the diagnostic electrochemical studies, the operation conditions for carbon/carbon capacitors have been carefully optimized to adjust the potential ranges of the individual electrodes to the electrochemical stability region. The system with the appropriate electrode mass ratio (m+/m&#8722; = 1.51) was characterized by a wide operating voltage of 2.0 V, gravimetric energy of 13.2 Wh kg&#8722;1, and practically a 100% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This translates to a significant rise in the maximum energy of 76% when compared to the aqueous counterpart. Additionally, reasonable charge&#8211;discharge rates and anti-freeze properties of the developed electrolyte enable application in a broad temperature range down to &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is demonstrated as well.</description>

                The Yuanzi River flows through the alluvial plain of Pinglu District, Shuozhou City, Shanxi Province, which belongs to the upper Sanggan Valley of Yongding River in the Haihe River Basin. The regional topography is representative of the Loess Plateau, where the loess layer has a high degree of homogeneity and depth of thickness. To study the changing rules of groundwater hydrochemistry and its influencing factors, we collected a total of 42 groups of groundwater samples in Pinglu District during the abundant and dry seasons. We used descriptive statistics, Piper diagrams and Gibbs diagrams, hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, and correlation analyses to investigate the hydrochemistry of the groundwater in the study area, as well as the main sources of ions and their influencing factors. The results show that: (1) The groundwater in the study area is neutral to weakly alkaline, and SO4&#183;Cl-Ca&#183;Mg controls the water chemistry of the groundwater in both the abundant and dry periods; the water quality in the abundant period is better than that in the dry period; (2) the groundwater undergoes water-rock interaction and cation adsorption alternatively in the flow path, and the water chemistry is mainly affected by the weathering of the rock and the precipitation from the atmosphere; (3) in the study area, there are gypsum, rock salt, and nitrate dissolution, and the groundwater is affected by the weathering and dissolution of carbonate minerals and silicate minerals; the weathering and dissolution of carbonate minerals are stronger than that of silicate minerals; (4) the recharge of the groundwater is dominated by atmospheric precipitation, and the groundwater is affected by evaporation during the dry season when the groundwater receives atmospheric precipitation. In addition to the impact of the water rock interaction and atmospheric precipitation recharge, the surface water and the wastewater discharged by human activities also have a certain influence on the groundwater. This study reveals the hydrochemical characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater in the Yuanzi River Basin, and the results are of great significance to the formation and evolution of groundwater in the Loess Plateau, and to the development, utilization, and protection of water resources.</description>

                Abstract Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4 and 2.4 &#956; m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected the presence of H 2 O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.70   &#8722; 0.93   + 1.27    , consistent with the stellar value, and a supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O   =    0.80   &#8722; 0.11   + 0.07    . We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within 1 &#963; but favored a slightly more substellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio (       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.74   &#8722; 0.17   + 0.23    and C/O   =    0.59   &#8722; 0.14   + 0.13    ). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ( V sys ) and Keplerian ( K p ) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted V sys for H 2 O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H 2 O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.</description>

      <title>Enhanced mobility of iron and manganese on mars: Evidence from kinetic experiments and models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2024.122242</link>
      <description>Matt&#233;o Loche, S&#233;bastien Fabre, A. Cousin, Arnaud Proietti, W. Rapin, Benjamin M. Tutolo, Pierre-Yves Meslin, Anissa Benmammar, Foteine Dimitracopoulos, R. C. Wiens, O. Gasnault, Chemical geology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399986368

                Several missions have reported complex alteration mineralogies on early Mars, which preserve environmental records of multiple water-rock-atmosphere interactions. The MSL and M2020 missions in Gale and Jezero have identified Fe and Mn-bearing secondary phases. These elements are used as tracers for the redox conditions on both Earth and Mars. However, to fully understand the short-lived and local-scale processes observed on Mars, it is necessary to go beyond thermodynamic models and experiments. Enhancing our ability to interpret the redox and hydrological conditions from the observed phase assemblage requires understanding the evolution of Fe and Mn during weathering. This study reports the results of kinetic alteration experiments and geochemical models conducted under Mars-like conditions. We tested variable pO2, pCO2, temperatures, and starting solutions. The results suggest that Fe is more mobile on Mars than on Earth, with a pseudo-equilibrium concentration that is kinetically controlled by dissolution and oxidation rates. Despite some initially modeled siderite precipitation, no siderite precipitation was observed in the altered powder. Solutions with higher acid concentrations were primarily controlled by dissolution kinetics, with both Fe and Mn being mobile, even when a minor amount of P, Fe, and S bearing secondary phases are formed. Based on our experimental results, we updated the model and conducted two large-scale sensitivity tests on our kinetic simulation. We confirmed that our experiments were too high in pO2 for siderite to form; however, we found that over a range of clearly oxidizing conditions from an equilibrium standpoint, Fe and Mn are mostly mobile, and siderite precipitation can occur. We were able to determine the pO2, pCO2 and the temporal space where Fe-oxide or siderite predominate or coexist, constraining the meaning of reducing or oxidizing conditions. Moreover, we also observed that siderite formation would require a much longer water residence time than Fe-oxide to precipitate, interpreted as higher weathering rates, or later evaporation required to effectively precipitate under any conditions. On ancient Mars, both Fe and Mn would be relatively mobile and prone to be leached from their host rock. Observing siderite or oxide would not primarily be a redox marker but would be a clue to a different hydrological regime. At the planetary scale, it would be challenging to form authigenic siderite during alteration. Although siderite would not indicate the presence of a particularly reducing atmosphere and that Mn-oxides are mainly pH controlled and do not require terrestrial-level amounts of oxygen, a collocated precipitation of siderite and Mn-oxides could also provide valuable information to constrain the redox environment of the ancient Mars.</description>

      <title>Consistency between apatite and zircon petrochronology supports robustness of apatite in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4524703/v1</link>
      <description>Hongying Qu, J. V. Rowland, Jingwen Mao, Evan A. Orovan, Michael C. Rowe, Shihua Zhong, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399979490

                Abstract Apatite low-temperature thermochronology can be double or even triple dated allowing for a reconstruction of the thermal history of rock from ~ 550 oC to near-surface temperatures. Even though it has disadvantageous U&#8211;Th&#8211;Pb contents (high Pb contents and low U and Th contents) and an unstable nature, apatite is still regarded to have the same robustness in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems as zircon, so far as to be replace zircon. Hence, we systematically studied characteristics of morphology, geochronology and geochemistry of apatite hosted in syenogranite and monzogranite intrusive rocks in the large Hutouya skarn deposit, in order to corroborate its potential thermochronological monitoring capabilities like zircon in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems. In this study, apatite grains can be subdivided into two types, FI-free Apatite I formed in the early less fractionated magma and FI-rich Apatite II crystallized in the late highly fractionated magma stage. We obtained ages of 229.0 &#177; 6.6 Ma in syenogranite and 224.3 &#177; 4.5 Ma / 223.7 &#177; 3.9 Ma in monzogranite from Apatite I of magmatic origins. Zircon grains in the two granites can be classified into three types. Zircon I is characterized by transparent and bright zones, Zircon II by dark and metamict features, and Zircon III by mineral inclusions. Zircon I grains with a magmatic texture of well-developed bright oscillatory zones, are most likely primary magmatic zircon that crystallized early in the evolution of granitic magma, dating results of which are 224.70 &#177; 0.61 Ma in syenogranite intrusions and 225.75 &#177; 0.66 Ma / 226.31 &#177; 0.78 Ma in monzogranite, respectively. The apatite&#8211;zircon timing is coincident. Furthermore, apatite trace rare earth element contents in the syenogranite and monzogranite intrusions display a negative-slope chondrite-normalized distribution from La to Lu with strong negative Eu anomalies and weak positive Ce anomalies, with major element contents that are statistically identical with enriched F but poor Cl. Zircon trace element compositions in the two intrusions show consistent and steeply increasing chondrite-normalized REE diagrams from La to Lu with negative Eu anomalies and strong positive Ce anomalies. Accordingly, apatite U&#8211;Pb dates and the corresponding in-situ trace element compositions and isotopes can test precise constraints on rock formation ages, temperature, oxygen fugacity, material source, and tectonic background, which can be relatively more robust when used as proxies for magma oxidation state.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Disease Course of COVID-19 and Seasonal Coronavirus Infections in Children</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000004423</link>
      <description>K&#252;bra Ayka&#231;, Melike Demir, Merve Ka&#351;&#305;k&#231;&#305;, Ali B&#252;lent Cengiz, Yasemin &#214;zs&#252;rek&#231;i, &#152;The &#156;Pediatric infectious disease journal/&#152;The &#156;pediatric infectious disease journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399854439

                To the Editors: We have read with great interest the article by Bayhan et al1 entitled "Is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Now More Like the Seasonal Coronaviruses Following Its Evolution?" Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered endemic in many parts of the world, the extent to which COVID-19 shares clinical findings with seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) is not yet fully understood. This article stated that sCoV infections have a higher lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) risk than COVID-19 and COVID-19 has a milder course than sCoV infections in children. However, the study period was different for each group, particularly patients infected with sCoVs were included in postpandemic period. Herein, we shared our data about pediatric patients due to SARS-CoV-2 during pandemic period between April 2020 and December 2021 versus sCoV. Therefore, our data provide more clear opportunity to understand the actual nature of disease courses of the mentioned infections within the same environment. This retrospective-cohort study was conducted in Ihsan Dogramaci Children Hospital, Turkey. Specimens were analyzed by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and patients were divided into 3 groups: outpatients and inpatients with sCoV infection and inpatients with COVID-19 (Table 1). Of all 427, the age of inpatients infected with sCoV (2 years) and SARS-CoV-2 (10 years) was different (P &lt; 0.001). Most of the patients (69.2%) had underlying disease in the inpatient sCoV group; 56.9% of them had LRTI, 3.1% had myocarditis and 6.2% presented with sepsis. Similarly, 69.3% of patients with COVID-19 had LRTI, 4% had myocarditis and 8% had sepsis. The leukocyte count was higher in sCoV inpatients (9.6 &#215; 103/&#956;L) than in COVID-19 inpatients (6.1 &#215; 103/&#956;L) (P = 0.003). The absolute lymphocyte count was 0.9 &#215; 10&#179;/uL in COVID-19 group and 2.8 &#215; 10&#179;/uL in inpatients with sCoV infection (P &lt; 0.001). Respiratory support rate was significantly lower in inpatients infected with sCoV (26.2%) than COVID-19 group (66.7%) (P &lt; 0.001). The length of hospital stays, pediatric intensive care unit admission and infection-related mortality rates were similar in both groups. COVID-19 presented with higher disease severity and increased risk of death compared with sCoV-infected adults, but there are few studies in children.1&#8211;3 In the light of the studies, the disease course of COVID-19 looks similar to sCoV infection1,2; however, it should be kept in mind that the need for respiratory support is more common in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the pandemic period. This is an indirect indicator of how appropriate the measures taken are to avoid increasing the burden on hospitals during the pandemic. This slightly severe disease course of the patients with COVID-19 might be attributed to the lower leukocyte and absolute lymphocyte count, but it is still not known why COVID-19 affects older children compared with sCoV.

The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the Platybelodon clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends. eLife assessment This study presents fundamental findings on the evolution of extremely elongated mandibular symphysis and tusks in longirostrine gomphotheres from the Early and Middle Miocene of northern China. The integration of multiple methods provides compelling results in the eco-morphology, behavioral ecology, and co-evolutionary biology of these taxa. In doing so, the authors elucidate the diversification of fossil proboscideans and their likely evolutionary responses to late Cenozoic global climatic changes. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90908.3.sa0 Read the peer reviews About eLife assessments eLife digest The elephant's trunk is one of the most efficient food-gathering organs in the animal kingdom. From large branches to thin blades of grass, it can coil around and bring many types of vegetation to the animals' strong, short mandibles. This versatility allows elephants to thrive in a range of environments, including grasslands. Trunks are not the only spectacular feature to emerge in Proboscideans, the family of which elephants are the only surviving group. During the early and middle Miocene (between 23 to 11.6 million years ago), many of these species had dramatically elongated lower jaws; how and why this trait emerged then disappeared is poorly understood. The role that lengthened mandibles and trunks played during feeding also remains unclear. To address these questions, Li et al. focused on Platybelodon, Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium, which belong to three Proboscidean families that roamed Northern China between 17 and 15 million years ago. Each had elongated lower jaws, but with strikingly distinct lengths and morphologies. Chemical analyses on enamel samples helped determine which habitat the families occupied, while mathematical modelling revealed how their mandibles tackled different types of plants. Trunk shape was assessed via analyses of the nasal region. The results suggest that Choerolophodon had mandibles better suited for processing branches and a short, 'primitive' trunk. Gomphotherium sported a versatile jaw that could handle both grass and trees, as well as a rather 'elephant-like' trunk. The jaw of Platybelodon seemed well-adapted to cut grass, and remarkable bone structures point towards a long, strong and flexible trunk. While modern elephants fully depend on their trunks to eat, morphological constraints suggest that, in these species, the appendage only served to assist feeding (e.g., by pressing down on branches). All families shared an environment that included grasslands and forests, but analyses suggest that, for a period, Choerolophodon favored relatively closed habitats while Platybelodon spread into grasslands and Gomphotherium navigated both landscapes. This suggests that the evolution of long, strong and flexible trunks is tightly associated with grazing. About 14 million years ago, a global cooling event led to grasslands expanding worldwide. The fossil record shows the mandibles of Proboscideans starting to shorten after this period, including in the descendants of Gomphotherium that would give rise to modern elephants. The work by Li et al. sheds light onto these evolutionary processes, and the environmental pressures which helped shape the trunk. Introduction Proboscideans are known for their exceptionally elongated and versatile trunks (Shoshani, 1998). However, unlike modern elephants, proboscideans underwent a prolonged evolutionary phase characterized by the presence of greatly elongated mandibular symphysis and mandibular tusks. This elongation can be traced back to the Late Oligocene species Palaeomastodon and Phiomia, which are among the earliest elephantiforms (Andrews, 1906), and continued through to the Late Miocene Stegotetrabelodon, a stem elephantid (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). Extreme longirostriny, a feature observed in fossil and modern fishes, reptiles, and birds, was relatively rare among terrestrial mammals and its occurrence in large-bodied proboscideans is particularly intriguing. Particularly, during the Early and Middle Miocene (approximately 20&#8211;11 Ma), the morphology of mandibular symphysis and tusks exhibited remarkable diversity, with over 20 genera from six families (Deinotheriidae, Mammutidae, Stegodontidae, 'Gomphotheriidae', Amebelodontidae, and Choerolophodontidae) displaying variations (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). Why did proboscideans have evolved such a long mandible of so diversified morphology? How did fossil proboscideans use their strange mandibular symphysis and tusks, and what was the role of trunk in their feeding behavior? Finally, what was the environmental background for the co-evolution of their mandible and trunks, and why did proboscideans finally lose their long mandible? These important issuers on proboscideans evolution and adaptation remain poorly understood. Addressing these significant aspects of proboscidean evolution and adaptation requires comprehensive investigations into the functional and eco-morphology of longirostrine proboscideans. Results Mandible morphology of bunodont elephantiforms During the Early and Middle Miocene, bunodont elephantiforms, as the ancestral group of living elephants, flourished (Osborn, 1936; Gheerbrant and Tassy, 2009; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). Bunodont elephantiforms include Amebelodontidae, Choerolophodontidae, and 'Gomphotheriidae'; all possess a greatly elongated mandibular symphysis (Gheerbrant and Tassy, 2009; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). Our comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions contained the majority of longirostrine elephantiform taxa at the species level and strongly supported this taxonomic scheme (Figure 1A; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 1, Figure 1&#8212;source data 1). The three families were characterized by their distinctive mandible and mandibular tusk morphology (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). The paraphyletic 'Gomphotheriidae' have clubbed lower tusks (Figure 1B and K; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2B); their mandibular symphysis is relatively narrow. This morphology is rather unspecialized, and the extant elephants are derived from 'Gomphotheriidae' (Tassy, 1996; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). The mandibular symphysis of Amebelodontidae is generally shovel-like and the mandibular tusks are usually flattened and wide. Platybelodon is the most specialized genus within this family; it possesses extremely flattened and widened mandibular tusks with a sharp distal cutting edge (Wang et al., 2013: Figure 1C, I, and J; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2A). Choerolophodontidae is unique because it completely lacks mandibular tusks and it has a long trough-like mandibular symphysis (Figure 1D, L, and M, Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2C&#8211;F). A very deep slit is present on each side of the distal alveolar crest (distal mandibular trough edge: Figure 1L), which is presumably for holding a keratinous cutting plate (Figure 1M), similar to the slits for holding large claws in felids and some burrowing mammals (e.g. anteaters). The anterior mandibular foramen of Choerolophodon is extremely large and tube-like (Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2D), which indicates a very developed mental nerve and eponymous artery (Eales, 1926), for the nutrition of tissues (i.e. keratins) grown from symphyseal dermis. The three lineages exhibit different evolutionary states of food acquisition organs (PC1 scores from mandible and tusk characters; see Materials and methods: Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 4; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 5B). Different food acquisition organs morphology strongly indicate different methods of food acquisition among the three gomphothere families.

However, the relative abundances of these three families were very different and varied through time. We investigated fossil bunodont elephantiforms from four regions: Linxia Basin (LX), Tongxin region (TX), Junggar Basin (JG), and Tunggur region (TG) (Figure 2, Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 1, Figure 2&#8212;source data 1). We focused on different fossil assemblages in different ages. We evaluated the amounts of fossils of each elephantiform taxon from major fossil assemblages in the above regions from three museums (IVPP, HPM, and AMNH, for full names, please see the Materials and methods) and calculated their proportions among all bunodont elephantiforms fossils (Figure 2A; Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 2A). During ~19&#8211;17 Ma, the quantities of both Choerolophodon (Choerolophodontidae) and Protanancus (Amebelodontidae) were larger than those of Gomphotherium ('Gomphotheriidae') despite the high diversity of Gomphotherium in species level. During ~17&#8211;15 Ma (the Mid&#8211;Miocene Climate Optimum [MMCO]), the relative fossil abundances of the three gomphothere families were similar. However, within Amebelodontidae, Platybelodon appeared and rapidly replaced the primitive Protanancus. After ~14.5 Ma (i.e. the beginning of the Mid&#8211;Miocene Climate Transition [MMCT]) (Westerhold et al., 2020), Choerolophodon suddenly experienced regional extinction, and Gomphotherium also gradually declined. Within Amebelodontidae, Aphanobelodon, which is morphologically similar to Platybelodon, only occurred in one fossil assemblage, and the Platybelodon population greatly expanded. After ~13 Ma, Gomphotherium were regionally extinct, and Platybelodon became the only genus among bunodont elephantiforms.

Overall, the &#948;13C values indicate a relatively open environment that consisted of a diverse range of habitats (including grasslands, wooded grasslands, and forests) dominated by C3 plants in northern China from ~19 to 11.5 Ma (Figure 2B, Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 1). In LX1 (Figure 2B; Figure 2&#8212;source data 2), at approximately ~18.5 Ma (see Supplementary file 1), both &#948;13C and &#948;13O values of Choerolophodon and Protanancus are similar and have a wide range of overlap, and those of Gomphotherium are in the middle of the range. This indicates that the niches of these three groups overlapped without obvious differentiation. In TX1,2 (~17.3 Ma) (Deng et al., 2019), during which Platybelodon first appeared, the &#948;13C values of Platybelodon are lower than those of Protanancus. The &#948;13C values of Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium, however, are all within the &#948;13C range of Amebelodontidae. In JG2 (~16 Ma), the &#948;13C value of Platybelodon shows a distinct positive shift, which indicates expansion into more open habitats (Figure 2B). However, Choerolophodon may have persisted in a relatively closed environment (Figure 2B). Moreover, the ecological niche of Gomphotherium appeared to be in between those of Platybelodon and Choerolophodon, and they potentially lived in the boundary area of open and closed habitats (Figure 2B). This isotopic niche pattern is also observed in JG3 (~14.3 Ma), with the rise of Platybelodon and decline of Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium. In TX3, LX4, and TG2,3 (after ~14 Ma), only Platybelodon were examined (as Gomphotherium specimens are too rare to sample); its ecological niche was similar to that previously occupied by Choerolophodon after the latter went extinct. Specialized feeding behaviors of three gomphothere families To reconstruct the feeding behaviors of the three gomphothere families, we performed finite element (FE) analyses on three models as representatives of each family: Choerolophodon, Gomphotherium, and Platybelodon (for model settings, see Figure 3&#8212;figure supplements 1&#8211;4; Supplementary files 1 and 2). We conducted two kinds of tests: the distal forces test and the twig-cutting test. In the distal forces test, after full muscle forces were exerted, a 5000 N vertical force is loaded on the distal end of each mandible (Figure 3A&#8211;C, Videos 1&#8211;3). The mandible strain energy curve (MSEC) of Platybelodon suddenly reaches a very high value, while the MSEC increases of Gomphotherium and Choerolophodon are far less than that of Platybelodon (Figure 3D). Then, keeping the magnitude of the external force unchanged, with change of the external force from vertical to horizontal direction, the MSEC of Platybelodon decreases even lower than that of Gomphotherium and was similar to that of Choerolophodon. This result indicates that the mechanical performance of the Platybelodon mandible is disadvantageous under distal vertical external forces, but greatly improved under horizontal external forces (Figure 3A&#8211;C, Videos 1&#8211;3).

In twig-cutting tests, a cylindrical twig model of orthotropic elastoplasticity was posed in three directions to the distal end of the mandibular tusks of Platybelodon and Gomphotherium, and to the keratinous cutting plate of Choerolophodon. The sum of the equivalent plastic strain (SEPS) from total twig elements was calculated (equivalent plastic strain represents the irreversible deformation of an element, and the sum from all twig elements can reflect the cutting effects) (Figure 3E), and the cutting videos are provided (Videos 4&#8211;9; Video 10; Video 11; Video 12; Video 13; Video 14; Video 15; Video 16; Video 17; Video 18 Video 19). When the twig was placed horizontally, the SEPS of the Choerolophodon model is the largest, which means that Choerolophodon has the highest twig-cutting efficiency, followed by Gomphotherium; while Platybelodon exhibits the much lower efficiency in cutting horizontal twigs than the other two models. When the twig was placed obliquely (45&#176; orientation), the Platybelodon model still shows the smallest SEPS value, although it was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the horizontal twig. Finally, when the twig itself was in a vertical direction, the growth direction of the keratinous cutting plate determines that Choerolophodon cannot cut in this condition. The SEPS of the Gomphotherium model also decreases and shows lower cutting efficiency. In contrast, the SEPS of the Platybelodon model increases another order of magnitude, which is substantially larger than that of any other taxa in any cutting state. These data strongly indicate that Platybelodon mandible is specialized for cutting vertically growing plants. However, the Choerolophodon mandible is specialized for cutting horizontally or obliquely growing plants, this explains the absence of mandibular tusks, but they are likely not able to feed on vertically growing plants. The cutting effect of the Gomphotherium mandible is relatively even for all directions. Video 4 Download asset This video cannot be played in place because your browser does support HTML5 video.

In recent decades, other exciting frontiers have been reached, e.g. exploring new or invisible particles (neutrinos, dark matter). Nuclear physics plays a central role in our understanding of both the atomic nucleus and seemingly unrelated things, e.g. our understanding of the interaction of neutrinos with matter, or how stars are born and die. With this theme issue, we are bringing together contributions from prominent researchers in the field in order to showcase the vibrancy of nuclear physics, covering a broad selection of current frontier topics. Central to this theme issue is the interplay between experiment and theory as the driving force of breakthroughs in the field. With advances in both nuclear theory and experimental capabilities, it is more important than ever to build the foundations of a truly collaborative community. It is only when experiments are informed by theory, and theory guided by experiments, that real breakthroughs can be achieved. This theme issue will showcase these synergies, inspiring and triggering further such collaborations.This special issue brings together the wider nuclear physics community, from traditional nuclear structure, reactions and dynamics, to hadron physics, nuclear astrophysics and neutrino physics. Some of the contributions venture further afield and touch upon the relevance of machine-learning techniques to nuclear physics, while others discuss strongly correlated matter that (while sharing many commonalities with neutron matter) is experimentally accessible using ultracold atoms (not nucleons). This reinforces the liminal position of nuclear physics across many research frontiers. We also hope that this issue will prompt new theory-experiment synergies and that it will plant the seeds for cross-collaborations amongst different fields.All contributions to this theme issue involve a mixture of theoretical and experimental work: exactly because nuclear physics stands at the interface between different scales, research in the field needs to make use of all available tools, both traditional/established and novel/exploratory. To make matters concrete, in what follows we will briefly discuss the contributions that now lie between one set of covers, starting with the mainly theoretical ones. In addition to briefly highlighting what is novel in the works contained herein, we also attempt to find a guiding thread through all of the original works that form the present theme issue.The work by Soma and Duguet nicely illustrates the aforementioned juxtaposition of traditional and novel approaches. The article hones in on the tool known as effective single-particle energies, which originally arose in the context of single-particle studies of shell structure in atomic nuclei. The authors clearly delineate the non-observable character of effective single-particle energies but do not limit themselves to criticism: they make contact with both modern ab initio quantum many-body studies of nuclei and experimental work. Specifically, they employ the successful Gorkov&#8211;Green's function approach to tackle a system recently studied experimentally at iThemba LABS. Through a combination of pedagogical exposition and original results, the scheme-dependence of effective single-particle energies is brought into sharp relief. While results focus on a specific neutron spin-orbit splitting along N = 20 isotones, the lessons gleaned from such studies are much more general.The next theoretical work (as well as the two following ones) falls into the large category of Monte Carlo approaches, employing random numbers to study a problem in microphysics. Specifically, Drissi et al. employ a continuum quantum Monte Carlo approach: variational Monte Carlo, in which a sophisticated guess for the ground-state wave function of a quantum many-body system is optimized in order to estimate physical properties as accurately as possible. A promising such guess that has been heavily used recently is that of neural-network quantum states; the authors go over neural wave functions with an added emphasis on the optimization algorithm. They discuss the Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature optimizer in detail and transcend its shortcomings via novel extensions. The authors also take the opportunity to reformulate their approach using the language of game theory; via the concept of decision geometry, they propose a new optimizer that behaves better than standard ones (or the authors' own earlier approaches). While the physical system tackled involves a central interaction, such approaches hold the promise of improving future nuclear calculations of related quantities.The work by Morrell et al. also studies spin-1/2 fermions (i.e. does not specifically address nucleons), which could function as a foundation for later nuclear studies. The main tool employed here is also quantum Monte Carlo; unlike the earlier work that used a continuum approach, Morrell et al. place their strongly interacting particles on a spatial lattice in addition to discretizing the (imaginary) time evolution. Crucially, the authors of this work are able to use very few temporal steps/a very coarse grid in the time direction via a quantum cumulant expansion, i.e. using automated algebra rather than the more typical numerical approach. The system studied is not just a toy problem: cold fermions at unitarity have been extensively probed in lab work over the last two decades using dilute atomic systems. Thus, the authors provide specific comparisons with results from an MIT experiment, not only for the pressure, but also for the compressibility and heat capacity. Unlike much of nuclear-structure physics, this work is carried out at finite temperatures; such approaches to the thermodynamics of strongly coupled systems can guide future work on nuclear astrophysics.The work by Curry et al. similarly employs a lattice Monte Carlo formalism, this time at 0 temperature. The specific technique used is auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, which has in the past been quite successful in condensed-matter and cold-atom studies; its main characteristic feature is the choice of working in a Slater-determinant space. The authors start by benchmarking against one- and two-dimensional results for the Hubbard model, a mainstay of solid-state physics. They then discuss experimentally relevant results for cold fermions at unitarity (also touched upon in the previous paragraph), paying close attention to the question of how to extrapolate away the lattice/discretization effects. The authors then turn to nuclear systems, carefully tuning the two-body lattice interaction such that it reproduces the neutron&#8211;neutron scattering length and effective range. They round things off by studying the energy of a few to many strongly interacting neutrons for a variety of lattice sizes. Given the power of the many-body technique and the promise of these neutron-matter results, one can expect extensions to bound states/atomic nuclei using similar approaches in the near future.Moving to a more synergistic contribution on both experiment and theory, Roth and Petri review the developments of the ab initio frontier, where chiral effective field theories of the strong interaction are being exploited to derive nuclear interactions and form the foundation of modern ab initio methods. Such an approach is bringing us closer to the understanding of nuclei from first principles, rooted in the theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Key to advancing the frontiers of ab initio theory is pioneering experiments on atomic nuclei that confront ab initio predictions and provide unparalleled benchmarks for the development and refinement of the theoretical approaches. This contribution puts forward selected experimental efforts along the carbon and oxygen chains that aim at validating these calculations, with a focus on electromagnetic observables, which present a particular challenge for ab initio theory. What will decisively drive future developments and breakthroughs in our understanding of the atomic nucleus from first principles is the strong synergy between experiment and theory and this contribution celebrates this.The work of Uesaka and Itagaki discusses the manifestation of non-uniformity in nuclei in the form of nuclear clustering. This review presents an interesting collection of examples of nuclear clustering throughout the nuclear chart and considers the underlying driving mechanism for this phenomenon, in terms of the tensor and spin-orbit forces as well as modern nucleon&#8211;nucleon interactions. Clustering plays a critical role in the origin of elements with further implications for nuclear fission and the potential to produce superheavy elements. Experimental breakthroughs in probing clustering in medium and heavy nuclei are explored and new experimental approaches, through knockout reactions, are presented.Continuing the theme of synergistic theoretical and experimental work, and extending the impact of nuclear physics to the cosmos, Wiedeking and Goriely discuss the impact of photon strength functions (PSF) and nuclear level densities (NLD) on shaping the outcomes of various nucleosynthetic processes. The authors give an overview of both experimental and theoretical methods to determine PSF and NLD, how they impact the important quantities that enter the astrophysical simulations, i.e. the reaction rates, and subsequently, how this affects the obtained abundances. Indeed, large uncertainties for (p,&#947;), (n,&#947;) and (&#945;,&#947;) reaction rates across many regions of the nuclear chart are uncovered from diverse NLD and PSF model combinations, leading to potentially significant abundance variations of the nucleosynthesis processes. This contribution reflects on the critical role that nuclear physics plays in the cosmos and highlights how advances in theory and experimentation are enhancing our grasp of the origin of elements.Nuclear physics input is critical not only to our understanding of the origin of the elements but to other exotic objects in the cosmos, most notably neutron stars. Neutron stars, dense remnants of supernova explosions, contain matter that reaches extreme densities and pressure. Currently, their true nature remains an open question. The presence of hyperons, particles containing strange quarks, affects the equation of state, influencing the neutron star's size and internal structure. Understanding the behaviour of hadrons and hyperons within neutron stars sheds light on the fundamental physics governing these enigmatic celestial objects. The excitation spectra of hyperons provide critical constraints to models of big-bang nucleosynthesis with the majority of visible matter in the Universe progressing through excited hyperon states. Novel experimental efforts that allow us to bridge the knowledge gap on the interaction between hyperons and nucleons and underpin the rich hyperon excitation spectra are underway at the new K-long facility. Zachariou et al. discuss the K-Long facility at the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory and its potential to investigate the hyperon&#8211;nucleon interaction and hyperon spectroscopy. Such experimental constraints are critical for understanding and testing QCD in the strange sector and for underpinning our understanding of dense nuclear matter.Scientific technological advances have allowed us to discover new phenomena, e.g. neutrino oscillations. Although this type of experiment lies well within the domain of high-energy physics, nuclear physics has a fundamental role to play, e.g. in measurements of single and double beta-decay spectra that illuminate the scale and nature of the neutrino mass, and in neutrino&#8211;nucleus scattering that underpins oscillation experiments. It is these experimental advances that have brought down barriers between long-standing traditional fields of physics. The contribution by Parno et al. celebrates the intersection between long-standing traditional fields of physics by discussing experimental neutrino physics in a nuclear landscape. The authors present two nuclear laboratories for exploring neutrino physics, through nuclear beta decays, to shed light on the absolute neutrino-mass scale and answer the question of whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. Parno et al. further discuss the nuclear physics of high-energy neutrino interactions, essential for interpreting long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiments, the use of low-energy neutrino scattering to illuminate nuclear properties and supernova nucleosynthesis, neutrino probes of fission reactors, searches for sterile neutrinos and applications in quantum sensing.This issue concludes with one of the most exciting facilities for nuclear physics research that is coming online in the near future, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), and discusses Nuclear Structure opportunities with GeV radioactive beams across a range of fields and scales: from low-energy physics via the investigation of multi-neutron systems and halos, to high-density nuclear matter and the equation of state, following heavy-ion collisions, fission, study of short-range correlations in nuclei, as well as hypernuclei. The R3B setup features prominently as a versatile experiment to perform kinematically complete measurements with high-energy radioactive ion beams, and various physics cases pursued within its experimental capabilities are presented. Even more interestingly, the authors put forward future opportunities at FAIR of studying exotic nuclei scattering off light ions and electrons in storage rings, as well as the concept of multi-GeV experiments with radioactive beams.As our brief summaries show, the works presented here involve many length scales, subfields and methodologies. It is worth reiterating that bringing together both theoretical and experimental works in the same venue (while not commonly done) is a good way to highlight past progress and jumpstart future discoveries.
