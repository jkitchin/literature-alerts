                In response to energy challenges, rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (RZABs) serve as an ideal platform for energy storage with a high energy density and safety. Nevertheless, addressing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in RZAB requires highly active and robust electrocatalysts. High-entropy Prussian blue analogues (HEPBAs), formed by mixing diverse metals within a single lattice, exhibit enhanced stability due to their increased mixing entropy, which lowers the Gibbs free energy. HEPBAs innately enable sacrificial templating, an effective way to synthesize complex structures. Impressively, in this study, we successfully transform HEPBAs into exquisite multiphase (multimetallic alloy, metal carbide, and metal oxide) heterostructure nanoparticles through a controlled synthesis process. The elusive multiphase heterostructure nanoparticles manifested two active sites for selective ORR and OER. By integrating CNT into HEPBA-derived nanoparticles (HEPBA/CNT-800), the HEPBA/CNT-800 demonstrates superior activity toward both ORR (E1/2 = 0.77 V) in a 0.1 M KOH solution and the OER (&#951; = 330 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2) in a 1 M KOH solution. The RZAB with a HEPBA/CNT-based air electrode demonstrated an open-circuit voltage of 1.39 V and provided a significant energy density of 71 mW cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the charge and discharge cycles lasting up to 40 h at a current density of 5 mA cm&#8211;2 demonstrate its excellent stability. This work provides an alternative avenue for the rational design of HEPBA's derivative for a sustainable rechargeable metal&#8211;air battery platform.</description>

      <title>Local compressive strain-induced anti-corrosion over isolated Ru-decorated Co3O4 for efficient acidic oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53763-8</link>
      <description>Shouwei Zuo, Zhi&#8208;Peng Wu, Deting Xu, Rafia Ahmad, Lirong Zheng, Jing Zhang, Lina Zhao, Wenhuan Huang, Hassan Al Qahtani, Han Yu, Luigi Cavallo, Huabin Zhang, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404020591

                Enhancing corrosion resistance is essential for developing efficient electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the strategic manipulation of the local compressive strain to reinforce the anti-corrosion properties of the non-precious Co3O4 support. The incorporation of Ru single atoms, larger in atomic size than Co, into the Co3O4 lattice (Ru-Co3O4), triggers localized strain compression and lattice distortion on the Co-O lattice. A comprehensive exploration of the correlation between this specific local compressive strain and electrocatalytic performance is conducted through experimental and theoretical analyses. The presence of the localized strain in Ru-Co3O4 is confirmed by operando X-ray absorption studies and supported by quantum calculations. This local strain, presented in a shortened Co-O bond length, enhances the anti-corrosion properties of Co3O4 by suppressing metal dissolutions. Consequently, Ru-Co3O4 shows satisfactory stability, maintaining OER for over 400 hours at 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with minimal decay. This study demonstrates the potential of the local strain effect in fortifying catalyst stability for acidic OER and beyond. Enhancing corrosion resistance is crucial for efficient electrocatalysts in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, the authors report the strategic manipulation of local compressive strain to improve the anti-corrosion properties of Co3O4, demonstrating stability for over 400 hours at 30 mA cm-2.</description>

                An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal&#8208;air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8208;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8208; to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn&#8208;air battery performs an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I&#8208; mainly generates I3&#8208; on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH&#8208; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8208;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system. This work offers a strategy to simultaneously improve the cycling life and reduce the charging voltage of Zn&#8208;air batteries through redox mediator methods.</description>

                An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal-air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn-air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3--mediated Zn-air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3- to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn-air battery performs an ultra-long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm-2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I- mainly generates I3- on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH- to generate oxygen and further revert to I-, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system.

      <title>A Hypothesis on the Function of High&#8208;Valent Fe in NiFe (Hydr)oxide in the Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>

                This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in&#8208;situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96 hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Defect Site Filling Strategy Induced Moderate Enrichment of Reactants for Efficient Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202410725</link>
      <description>Baixue Cheng, Haoyu Zhan, Yankun Lu, Danning Xing, Xingshuai Lv, Thomas Frauenheim, Peng Zhou, Shuangyin Wang, Yuqin Zou, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404045918

                Abstract The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a feasible approach for the efficient utilization of biomass. Defect regulation is an effective strategy in the field of biomass upgrading to enhance the adsorption capacity of reactants and thus increase the activity. However, how to select appropriate strategies to regulate the over&#8208;enrichment of reactants induced by excessive oxygen vacancy is still a huge challenge. In this work, the defect&#8208;filling strategy to design and construct an element&#8208;filled oxygen vacancy site layered double hydroxide (S&#9472;Ov&#9472;LDH) is adopted, which achieves a significant reduction in the electrolysis potential of biomass platform molecule HMF oxidation reaction and a significant increase in current density. Physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculations prove that the formation of metal&#9472;S bond in the second shell effectively regulates the electronic structure of the material, thus weakening the over&#8208;strong adsorption of HMF and OH &#8722; induced by excessive oxygen vacancy, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valence Co 3+ during the reaction, and forming new adsorption sites. This work discusses the catalytic enhancement mechanism of defect filling in detail, fills the gap of defect filling in the field of biomass upgrading, and provides favorable guidance for the further development of defect regulation strategies.</description>

      <title>ROLE OF SURFACTANTS ON ELECTROCATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF Co/Al LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES FOR HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN GENERATION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202401377</link>
      <description>Honey John, Sijla Rosely, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404048424

                Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have recently attracted much attention in the scientific community as a prominent catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because they are economical, extremely stable and highly active. Here, we synthesized Co/Al based LDH systems that efficiently perform as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. Exfoliation of this layered material via anion intercalation into a few layers further enhanced its activity. In this work, we reported the synthesis of Co/Al LDHs via co&#8208;precipitation followed by hydrothermal method and different surfactant functionalized LDHs (with anionic surfactant &#8211;SDS, cationic surfactant &#8211; CTAB and non&#8208;ionic surfactant &#8211; PEG 4000). SDS modified LDH (s LDH) showed notable stability and competent results in hydrogen evolution in addition to oxygen evolution. The exfoliation of s LDH caused enhancement in the high specific surface area about 6.8 times compared to pristine LDH, as evident from BET data. The onset potential for HER as obtained from the polarisation curve for s LDH is &#8208;0.41 V vs RHE with Tafel slope of 67.4 mV/dec. Similarly, OER onset potential and corresponding Tafel slope are 1.53 V vs RHE at 10 mA/cm2 and 90.2 mV/dec, respectively.</description>

                Abstract Polymetallic oxides with extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands, and way&#8208;out coordination environments, built by an isomorphic substitution strategy, may create unique contributing to concertedly catalyze water oxidation, which is of great significance for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO 2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides. For acidic water oxidation, the obtained InSnRuO 2 displays an ultralow overpotential of 183 mV (versus RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 103.02 A mg Ru &#8722;1 , respectively. For a long&#8208;term stability test of PEMWE, it can run at a low and unchangeable cell potential (1.56 V) for 200 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 , far exceeding current IrO 2 ||Pt/C assembly in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . Accelerated degradation testing results of PEMWE with pure water as the electrolyte show no significant increase in voltage even when the voltage is gradually increased from 1 to 5 A cm &#8722;2 . The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov&#8208;electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self&#8208;trapped Ov&#8208;electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long&#8208;term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next&#8208;generation Ru&#8208;based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>

                The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</description>

      <title>A Proof-of-Principle Demonstration: Exploring the Effect of Anode Layer Microstructure on the Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                This study explores the effect of Ni-Co-O anode layer microstructure on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Four anodes with similar Ni-Co-O loadings and chemical characteristics but distinct morphologies are fabricated by ultrasonic spraying catalyst inks of varying solvent composition (pure water vs a water-ethanol mixture) and drying temperatures (50 &#176;C and 150 &#176;C) on Ni plates. Upon varying solvent composition, particles in the water-based ink exhibited lower stability than particles in the water-ethanol-based ink, boosting the particle connectivity in the layers. This particle connectivity correlated with the mechanical strength of the layers, resulting in reduced contact resistance and enhanced activity. Our second observation is that at 50 &#176;C, the surface morphology exhibited hill-like islands with higher roughness, while at 150 &#176;C, concave hemispherical shapes with lower roughness were observed. From 2D-distribution data, we found that surface roughness correlated with the wettability with electrolyte. Roughness increased the lyophobicity and enhanced the activity through more accessible active sites and efficient bubble transport. Taken together, this work highlights how microstructure affects macroscopic layer properties, and how these in turn can enhance or diminish the performance of the OER compared to bare nickel, offering insights into the knowledge-based design of anode layers.</description>

                Abstract Efforts are underway to develop highly active catalysts to reduce the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Metal&#8211;organic frameworks or coordination polymers are promising candidates because of their tunable structures and high surface areas. In this study, Nickel and Cobalt trans &#8208; cinnamate ( t&#8208;ca ) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Their structures were analyzed and found to be isostructural. Both complexes exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties in the OER compared to those of IrO 2 , with overpotentials of 373 and 390 mV and Tafel slopes of 58 and 66 mV/dec. These excellent characteristics were attributed to the electron delocalization of the metal centers via interactions with &#960;&#8208;&#960; delocalized organic ligands. Ni t&#8208;ca , with stronger ligand interactions, displayed an enhanced OER catalytic performance, emphasizing the importance of metal&#8211;ligand interactions and suggesting that further exploration of diverse &#960;&#8211;&#960; delocalized organic ligands and metal centers may lead to further advancements in electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Hydrogen production by water splitting is one of the low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt-phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the inexpensive and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies to the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with the 11 wt% of P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of &#8211;115.4 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8 wt% (&#8211;121.5 mV) and 5 wt% (&#8211;182.9 mV) of P. In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (394 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with the 8 wt% of P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5 wt% (416 mV) and 11 wt% (432 mV) of P. These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.</description>

                Abstract Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their low cost, intrinsic safety, and environmental benignity. However, the sluggish kinetics of the cathodic reactions severely limits the ZAB performances in practical use, calling for high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts. Herein, an ultrahigh&#8208;active bifunctional electrocatalyst is developed with a record&#8208;low &#916; E of 0.56 V, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark (Pt/C+Ir/C, &#916; E = 0.77 V) and many other reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (mostly &#916; E &#8805; 0.60 V). The nanoscale composite of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom sites and nanosized layered double hydroxides endows the bifunctional electrocatalyst with high conductivity and a large active surface that afford strengthened electron conduction and ion transport pathways. Furthermore, a remarkable improvement in stability is realized following the current division principle. ZABs with the bifunctional electrocatalyst deliver a high peak power density of 198 mW cm &#8722;2 and excellent cycling durability for over 6000 cycles. Moreover, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale ZABs are constructed and cycled under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions. This work breaks the activity record for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and expands the potential of ZABs for sustainable energy storage.</description>

                The development and exploration of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting are in high demand and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Herein, by incorporating the advantages of catalytic&#8208;active polyoxometalates (POMs) and structural stable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), two POM@MOFs composite materials, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe, have been successfully prepared via the encapsulation of POMs anions [MoV12O30(&#181;2&#8208;OH)10H2{NiII4(H2O)12}]&#8729;14H2O (noted as Ni4Mo12) and [MoV12O30(&#956;2&#8208;OH)10 H2{CoII(H2O)3}4]&#8729;12H2O (noted as Co4Mo12) into the cavities of MOFs NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe), respectively. Compared to each individual components, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe composites, as heterogeneous electrocatalysts, both showed enhanced electrocatalytic capacities for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions with overpotentials of 332.64 mV for Ni4Mo12@Fe and 352.64 mV for Co4Mo12@Fe at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Additionally, the enhanced electrocatalytic capacities of these two composites could also achieve towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such a POMs&#8208;assisted strategy for the formation of POM@MOFs composites described here paves a new avenue for the development of highly economical, active non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Cathode Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;air Batteries based on the Derivatives of MXene@ZIFs</title>

                Abstract Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial processes at the cathode of zinc&#8208;air batteries. Developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts at the air cathode is significant for the practical application of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, N&#8208;doped layered MX containing Co 2 P/Ni 2 P nanoparticles is synthesized by growing CoNi&#8208;ZIF on the surface and interlayers of the two&#8208;dimensional material MXene (Ti 2 C 3 ) followed by phosphating calcination. The growth of CoNi&#8208;ZIF on the surface of MXene results in the attenuation of high&#8208;temperature structural damage of MXene, which in turn leads to the formation of Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX with a hierarchical configuration, higher electron conductivity, and abundant active sites. The optimized Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V for the ORR and an overpotential of 345 mV for the OER. In addition, DFT calculations were adopted to investigate the mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. The liquid zinc&#8208;air battery with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 783.7 mAh g &#8208;1 and exceeds 280 h (840 cycles) cycle stability, superior to zinc&#8208;air batteries constructed by the cathode of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 and other previous works. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;state battery synthesized with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits stable cycle performance (154 h/462 cycles).</description>

                Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their heavy reliance on free electrons at the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;band significantly limits the screening of potentially efficient, earth&#8208;abundant alternatives. Despite extensive exploration of catalyst engineering through multi&#8208;metal cooperation to modulate electron configuration by introducing additional transition metals, practical success remains elusive. Here, we present a straightforward electrodeposition method for preparing amorphous FeCoAl hydroxide catalysts. The introduction of Al contributes external free electrons, enabling a well&#8208;defined electron configuration for intermediate adsorption. Al doping also adjusts the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;band position of adjacent Co atoms, bringing them closer to the Fermi level and significantly enhancing intrinsic activity at the active sites. Furthermore, Al dopants facilitate rapid mass and charge transfer near the catalyst layer, promoting faster reaction kinetics. Leveraging these properties, the FeCoAl hydroxide catalyst achieves a large current density of 100 mA cm &lt;sup&gt;&#8208;2&lt;/sup&gt; at an overpotential of 340 mV, with a small Tafel slope of 29.1 mV dec &lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work provides valuable insights for designing efficient electrocatalysts by leveraging free electron&#8208;rich metal doping and expanding the parameter space for catalyst engineering.</description>

                Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24% at 450 nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39 h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical water&#8208;electrolysis for hydrogen generation often requires more energy due to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work introduces a double&#8208;layered nanoflower catalyst, NiFe&#8208;LDH@S&#8208;NiFeO x /NF, featuring a crystalline NiFe&#8208;LDH coating on amorphous S&#8208;NiFeO x on nickel foam. Strategically integrating a crystalline&#8208;amorphous (c&#8208;a) heterostructure leverages strain engineering to enhance OER activity with low overpotentials ( &#951; 100 = 220 and &#951; 500 = 245 mV) and stability (135 h at &#951; 100 and 80 h at &#951; 500 ). Theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain can optimize the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates to reduce the reaction energy barrier, thus improving the reaction kinetics and performance of OER. Moreover, its phosphated derivative, NiFeP@S&#8208;NiFeO x /NF, exhibits high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance ( &#951; 10 = 64 mV, &#951; 100 = 187 mV). An alkaline water&#8208;electrolysis cell of NiFeP@S&#8208;NiFeO x /NF(&#8722;)||NiFe&#8208;LDH@S&#8208;NiFeO x /NF(+) requires only a cell voltage of 1.77 V at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , demonstrating excellent stability over 110 h (at both 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ). This work highlights the benefits of integrating crystal&#8208;amorphous interfaces and strain effects, offering insights into the understanding and optimizing catalytic OER mechanism and advancing water&#8208;electrolysis technology.</description>

      <title>Enhanced oxygen evolution reaction in flexoelectric thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0215284</link>
      <description>Jibo Xu, Xiaoyan Zhang, Lei Zhu, Ming Wu, Junzhe Liu, Z. Liu, Meiyue Li, Yuhao Yue, Yawen Xu, Chenyu Dong, Weijie Zheng, Lin Zhu, Yanqiang Cao, Chunyan Zheng, Jianyi Liu, Aidong Li, Di Wu, Lixue Zhang, Zheng Wen, Applied Physics Reviews. 11(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404123773

                Recently, the flexoelectric effect has triggered considerable interest in energy-related applications, such as flexo-actuation, flexo-photovoltaic, and flexo-catalysis, because of its ubiquitous feature allowing the creation of electric polarity, i.e., the flexoelectric polarization (Pflexo), in non-polar materials by strain gradient. Here, we show a flexoelectric strategy in electrocatalytic water splitting. Remarkably enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are achieved in strain-gradient LaFeO3 (LFO) thin-film heterostructures owing to the promotion of kinetic processes by Pflexo. The improved OER is demonstrated by increased current density of &#8764;300% in linear sweep voltammetry and lowered charge transfer resistance by two orders of magnitude in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These are ascribed to the flexoelectric-induced downward bending of the LFO band, as revealed by density functional theory calculations and band structure measurements. With Pflexo in the thin-film heterostructure catalysts, the adsorption of hydroxyl ions is strengthened on the polar LFO surface, and the transfer of electrons is accelerated from the reactants/key intermediates to the catalyst across the band-tilted LFO layer. These findings indicate the significance of flexoelectric effect in OER kinetics and open a new perspective for exploiting catalytic mechanisms and performances in water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Design of highly efficient cost effective and self-supported bi-functional electrocatalyst for the production of green Hydrogen is significant for renewable and sustainable energy conversion to achieve future carbon neutral. Meanwhile, as we know that the overall water splitting is an uphill reaction requires 285.8 kJ of energy, corresponds to the HHV of hydrogen, state-of-the-art developments are necessary to greatly improve the efficiency by rationally designing non-precious metal-based robust bi-functional catalysts for promoting both the cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic oxygen evolution reactions. The performance of metal phosphide towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution was examined under application relevant conditions in an alkaline and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer cell stack. The in-house designed stacked electrolyzer exhibited stable performances with a hydrogen production rate of few Nm3 per hour without any decay, pave the path towards large scale application with substantial reduction in CAPEX and OPEX cost.

                Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an attractive alternative anodic reaction to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for its low thermodynamic potential (0.37 V vs RHE). A major challenge that prohibits its practical application is the six-electron transfer process during UOR, demanding enhancements in the catalytic activity. Herein, a Fe-doped Ni</description>

      <title>Seawater Electrolysis at Ultra-High Current Density: A Comparative Analysis of Cylindrical versus Conical Electrodes</title>

                Seawater electrolysis preferentially leans towards Chlorine Evolution Reaction (CER) over Oxygen Evolution Reactions (OER) under conventional conditions, but OER becomes more dominant at sufficiently higher current densities. In this study, we evaluated the effector of cylindrical and conical electrode geometries on CER and hydrogen production at high current density (i.e., &amp;gt;1 A/cm2). We found the point of lowest CER within a voltage range of 40 V to 90 V. Conical electrodes, optimized to reduce CER, produced a magnitude less chloride (502 ppb) than cylindrical electrodes (1485 ppb) at nearly double the current density (~12 and ~6 A/cm2 respectively). However, this reduction in CER with conical electrodes was accompanied by a 25% decrease in hydrogen production. In addition, both cylindrical and conical electrodes were able to heat 500 ml of seawater by approximately 6-7 degrees Celsius over a two-minute period with cylindrical electrodes heating slightly less than conical electrodes.</description>

      <title>Quantification of electrochemically accessible iridium oxide surface area with mercury underpotential deposition</title>

                Research drives development of sustainable electrocatalytic technologies, but efforts are hindered by inconsistent reporting of advances in catalytic performance. Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>

                The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting for green hydrogen production necessitates effective electrocatalysts. Currently, commercial catalysts are primarily platinum-based. Therefore, finding catalysts with comparable catalytic activity but lower cost is essential. This paper describes spinel-structured catalysts containing nickel cobaltite NiCo 2 O 4 , graphene, and additionally doped with heteroatoms. The structure and elemental composition of the obtained materials were analyzed by research methods such as TEM, SEM-EDX, XRD, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements showed that hybrid materials containing nickel cobaltite NiCo 2 O 4 doped with graphene are highly active catalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (Tafel slopes = 91 mV dec &#8722;1 , overpotential = 468 mV and onset potential = -339 mV), while in the oxygen evolution reaction (Tafel slopes = 51 mV dec &#8722;1 , overpotential = 1752 mV and onset potential = 370 mV), bare NiCo 2 O 4 without the addition of carbon has a worse activity (for HER: Tafel slopes = 120 mV dec &#8722;1 , overpotential - does not achieve and onset potential = -404 mV, for OER: Tafel slopes = 54 mV dec &#8722;1 , overpotential = 1796 mV and onset potential = 410 mV). In terms of stability, comparable results were obtained for each synthesized compound for both the HER and OER reactions.</description>

      <title>Cobalt Phosphide Decorating Metallic Cobalt With a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nano&#8208;Shell Surpasses Platinum Group Metals for Oxygen Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bte2.20240029</link>
      <description>Muhammad Tahir, Muhammad Asim Farid, Elvin Aliyev, Zhen&#8208;Feng Huang, Ji&#8208;Jun Zou, Shangfeng Du, Battery energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404117598

                ABSTRACT It has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to cultivate capable and resilient oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity, low price, and long lifetime to replace the commonly used platinum group metals, i.e., Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and RuO 2 /IrO 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a promising approach to address the challenges associated with oxygen electrocatalysis by introducing a cobalt phosphide/metallic cobalt (Co 2 P/Co) core wrapped in a nitrogen&#8208;doped conductive carbon (CN) nano&#8208;shell, demonstrated as Co 2 P/Co@NC. The strong chemical bonding between metallic cobalt and phosphorus, nitrogen and conductive carbon contributes to the enhanced conductivity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The nitrogen doping in the carbon shell provides additional Co&#8211;N active sites, which are crucial for ORR activity. Co 2 P/Co@NC demonstrates promising activity and stability compared to noble metals such as Pt for ORR in an alkaline medium. This suggests its potential as a cost&#8208;effective alternative to Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Further, due to factors such as strong cobalt&#8208;phosphide bonding, high cobalt oxidation states and excellent conductivity of the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon shell, the Co 2 P/Co@NC outperforms noble metal oxides like iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) for OER. Co 2 P/Co@NC exhibits a low potential difference of 0.63 V, which is among the lowest reported for bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both ORR and OER. Overall, the described strategy offers a promising avenue for developing efficient, low&#8208;cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions, which are crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.</description>

                Ti 3 C 2 , one typical MXene, has great potential to be coupled with various transition metals. Herein, a novel and effective catalyst is developed by synergistically loading VCoCO x onto Ti 3 C 2 &#8208;modified nickel foam (VCoCO x &#8211;Ti 3 C 2 @NF). Field emission scanning electron microscope and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy are employed to characterize the morphology and structure. As expected, the catalyst optimized by response surface methodology attains overpotentials of 290 and 64 mV and Tafel slopes of 82 and 79 mV dec &#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. By using the bifunctional VCoCO x &#8211;Ti 3 C 2 @NF catalyst, the water splitting current density achieves 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 mol L &#8722;1 KOH electrolyte at cell voltage of 1.52 V, comparable with the noble metal electrolyzer Pt@C@NF||RuO 2 @NF (1.57 V). Furthermore, the resulting catalyst exhibits excellent cycling durability after 120 h of continuous catalysis, which retains 103.8% and 105.4% of potential (V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for OER and HER, respectively. Density functional theory calculation reveals that the Gibbs free energy barriers for the OER and HER intermediates are reduced due to the integration of VCoCO x with Ti 3 C 2 @NF. The fabricated VCoCO x &#8211;Ti 3 C 2 @NF catalyst is a promising electrochemical material for clean energy production.</description>

                Abstract Clean energy and environmental pollution are two key concerns of modern society and are pivotal necessities for the economic, social, and sustainable development of the world. Today around 80% of energy is generated using nonrenewable resources and fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal) which ultimately results in hazardous global emissions. As a clean substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen has emerged as a promising and renewable energy resource. Utilization of this energy resource requires the development of active, stable, low&#8208;cost environmentally friendly techniques. Water splitting electrolysis is a method for producing clean and efficient hydrogen using an environmentally benign technique that is currently at its most mature stage. Electrolysis is attracting ever&#8208;increasing attention, as it is a promising electrochemical device for hydrogen production from water due to the high conversion efficiency and relatively low energy input required when compared to thermochemical and photocatalytic methods. This paper will outline the need, performance, and insight of anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer. Recent developments in the design and preparation of AEM. New strategies for activity, stability, and efficiency improvement of AEM. Membrane types, and factors affecting AEM performance in an electrolyzer. This review also discusses the effects, operating characteristics, and energy consumption of electrocatalysts in the AEM electrolyzer. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pathways and mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This study seeks to provide a detailed overview of recent accomplishments in the field of the hydrogen economy, particularly electrolysis, to inspire further research and development to address the technology's obstacles.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting required efficient electrocatalysts to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Here, we adopted greenway coprecipitation (GC) method to synthesize conducting polymer (CP) nanotunnel network affixed with luminal&#8211;abluminal CoNi hydroxides (GC-CoNiCP), namely, GC-Co1Ni2CP, GC-Co1.5Ni1.5CP, and GC-Co2Ni1CP. The active catalyst, GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC, has low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (307 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (47 mV dec&#8211;1) than IrO2 (125 mV dec&#8211;1). The electrochemical active surface area (EASA) normalized linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve exhibited outstanding intrinsic activity of GC-Co2Ni1CP, which required 285 mV to attain 10 mA cm&#8211;2. At 1.54 V, the estimated turnover frequency (TOF) of GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC (0.017337 s&#8211;1) was found to be 3-fold higher than that of IrO2 (0.0014 s&#8211;1). Furthermore, the GC-Co2Ni1CP/NF consumed a very low overpotential (281 mV) with a small Tafel slope of 121 mV dec&#8211;1. The ultrastability of GC-Co2Ni1CP for industrial application was confirmed by durability at 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for the OER (GC/NF-8 h, 2.0%/100 h, 2.2%) and overall water splitting (100 h, 3.8%), which implies that GC-Co2Ni1CP had adequate kinetics to address the elevated rates of water oxidation. The effect of pH and addition of tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+) reveal that GC-Co2Ni1CP follows the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The solar-powered water electrolysis at 1.55 V supports the efficacy of GC-Co2Ni1CP in the solar-to-hydrogen conversion. The environmental impact studies and solar-driven water electrolysis proved that GC-CoNiCP has excellent greenness and efficiency, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sodium&#8208;Rich, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Free P2&#8208;Layered Manganese Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404280</link>
      <description>Zulkifli, Balaji Sambandam, Ahmad Nurul Fahri, Kiki Rezki Lestari, Seunggyeong Lee, Jaekook Kim, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404115448

                Abstract The rapid capacity loss attributed to irreversible phase reactions and structural instability has consistently affected the development of P2&#8208;layered cathode materials. Moreover, the introduction of costly elements such as single or multiple dopants has failed to resolve the sustainability challenges in designing an optimal Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathode. This study proposes a Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;free, poly&#8208;elemental doping strategy (Li, Mg, and Cu) combined with high sodium content for an Mn&#8208;based P2&#8208;layered cathode designed for Na + ion storage. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirms the absence of P2 &#8211; O2 phase transitions during cycling for both NLMMC87 (Na 0.87 Li 0.1 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.7 Cu 0.1 O 2 ) and NLMMC77 (Na 0.77 Li 0.1 Mg 0.1 Mn 0.7 Cu 0.1 O 2 ). This can be attributed to the co&#8208;substitution of the electronegative Cu element and the stabilizing dopants Li and Mg, which suppress oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the high sodium content within the host structure promotes high reversible capacity, enhances structural stability, and minimizes internal stress due to volume changes. Moreover, NLMMC87 demonstrates a reversible capacity of 167.9 mA h g &#8722;1 at 0.1 C (97% Coulombic efficiency) and maintains excellent stability across various current rates. Further investigations into the practical application of NLMMC87 in a sodium full cell will be a critical step toward realizing an ideal cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency in Alkaline Water Electrolysis Using Optimized Raney Nickel Coatings on Stainless Steel Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222831-ms</link>

                Abstract Hydrogen, as a clean and high-energy-density fuel, holds immense promise for future energy systems. The aim of this study is to enhance the efficacy and durability of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis by optimizing Raney Nickel coatings on stainless steel electrodes. This work aims to reduce costs and improve the performance of electrolysis systems, making hydrogen production more feasible for large-scale applications. The study involved the electrodeposition of Raney Nickel on stainless steel substrates using a modified Watt&#8217;s bath. The pretreatment process included degreasing, acid pickling, and Nickel Strike coating to prepare the electrode surface. Functional coatings were applied in a solution containing NiSO4, NiCl2, H3BO3, and ZnCl2 at 50&#176;C. The obtained coating substrates were characterized both chemically and morphogically by XRF analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The performance of the electrodes was evaluated through electrochemical measurements, determining the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and overpotentials for HER and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) The optimized Raney Nickel coatings, referred to as Raney 2, demonstrated a significant improvement in both HER and OER performance compared to traditional coatings. The Raney 2 coating exhibited a threefold increase in ECSA. The accelerated aging tests showed that the Raney 2 coating outperformed Raney 1, with lower peak voltages and improved stability over time. The roughness factor of the Raney 2 electrode is higher, indicating has an extensive reactive surface area. Furthermore, the study confirmed that the incorporation of elements from the 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode, such as iron, contributed to enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for OER. These findings suggest that the modified coating process can significantly extend the operational life and efficiency of electrolysis electrodes. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of Raney Nickel coatings by incorporating a 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode during deposition, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. The resulting hybrid coating demonstrates superior electrochemical performance and durability, offering a cost-effective solution for improving alkaline water electrolysis systems. This advancement can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient hydrogen production technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of platinum content on semiconductor and electrochemical properties of materials based on titanium suboxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32434/0321-4095-2024-156-5-131-137</link>

                The effect of platinum content on the surface morphology, phase composition and electrochemical properties of materials based on titanium suboxides was investigated. Titanium suboxides are formed at the stage of coating reduction under cathodic polarization, which allows the formation of a porous developed surface for electrodeposition of catalytic platinum layers. The main allotropic modification of TiOx in the studied composite materials is anatase, which contains particles of elemental titanium and platinum. The investigated materials are highly doped semiconductors with a high concentration of charge carriers. With an increase in the platinum content, an extreme dependence of the potential of flat zones is observed, which is associated with the formation of a composite material. The electrocatalytic activity was studied in the reactions of oxygen and hydrogen evolution. The overvoltage of oxygen production on platinum-containing materials is much lower than on the TiOx electrode. The slope of the linear dependence of the potential on the current density decreases with an increase in platinum content. The Tafel slope for the studied materials in the hydrogen evolution reaction was 160 mV&#61655;dec&#8211;1 for coatings containing 0.25 mg&#61655;cm&#8211;2 Pt; whereas it was equal to 42 and 43 mV&#61655;dec&#8211;1 for electrodes with 0.5 and 2 mg&#61655;cm&#8211;2 Pt, respectively.</description>

                This study explores carbon dioxide enrichment in anaerobic digestion to boost biomethane production and assess degradation kinetics and methanogenic pathway evolution. Carbon dioxide enrichment was found to improve inoculum digestion, supplying additional energy for methanogenic archaea. The methane yield of blank inocula increased by 53 % to 77 % after carbon dioxide enrichment. Although further digestion of inoculum residues took longer, rapid adaptation led to an increased methane production rate that surpassed the lag phase. No antagonistic effects were observed with carbon dioxide enrichment after applying the feedstocks. Increased methane production, along with a significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand, confirms the impact of carbon dioxide enrichment on inoculum digestion. Isotope analysis showed an increase in &#948;</description>

                The versatility, contribution to sustainability, and diversity of applications of bacterial cellulose require large-scale production processes and new alternatives in terms of biological systems that, under controlled conditions, favor the growth and production of this biomaterial. This review article describes the technologies developed and the advances achieved in regard to the production of bacterial cellulose on a small and large scale, according to the findings evidenced in the scientific literature in the last ten years. A review, based on the guidelines in the PRISMA&#174; methodology, of a selection of articles was carried out, with a Cohen&#8217;s Kappa coefficient of 0.465; scientific databases, such as Web of Science, SCOPUS, PubMed, Taylor and Francis, and ProQuest, were considered. There is a wide variety of bacterial pulp production systems and the design of such a system is based on the type of cellulose-producing bacteria, oxygen requirements, mixing and agitation, temperature control, sterilization and cleaning requirements, and production scalability. The evolution in the development of bioreactors for bacterial cellulose has focused on improving the production process&#8217;s efficiency, productivity, and control, and adapting to the specific needs of bacterial strains and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Murburn redox bioenergetics and ROS-radiations connectivity: Insights into the origin, evolution, sustenance and termination of life!</title>

                Research leading to murburn (&#8216;mured burning&#8217;) concept disclosed the previously ignored, yet unavoidable central physiological function of diffusible reactive (oxygen/sulfur/nitrogen) species (abbreviated as DRS or DROS/DRSS/DRNS) at low concentrations, namely that of coupling factors in numerous redox-processes, like oxidative-/photo-phosphorylation, leading to direct in fluid ATP synthesis by exergonic radical reactions. The formation of oxygen-centric anions/radicals near proteins/membrane surfaces leads to effective charge separation (ECS), serving as the origin of &#8216;cellular electrical activity&#8217;. The stochastic interactive chemical equilibriums of DRS with components in the fluid (ADP, Pi, and others) are characterized by an observable new type of stochastic, hormetic and idiosyncratic &#8216;outside active center&#8217; mechanism/kinetics. In conjunction with coacervate organization, murburn could maintain discrete ion and solute differentials across &#8216;islets&#8217; of different phases without ion-pumping or deterministic electron transport chains. Murburn-type reactions within pre-biotic coacervates afforded powering, coherence, homeostasis, electro-mechanical features and sensing/responding abilities (PCHEMS: the &#8216;instant&#8217; functions of life), later supplemented and propagated by deterministic genetic means (central dogma) in cellular systems. As murburn (with ECS-DRS as core physiology) and coacervation rooted cellular PCHEMS since life&#8217;s origin (evidenced currently by the incorporation of convoluted lipid-membrane enriched structures of mitochondria and chloroplasts as the bioenergetic micro-organelles) and sustained it thereafter, normal aging, disease, evolution and termination must be understood in the new framework. Further, this write-up provides a viable thermodynamic rationale for DRS-radiation connectivity in routine/pathological cellular functions.</description>

      <title>Interface analysis of oxide free MoS2 films fabricated by solution process</title>

                We report a solution-based approach for the synthesis of oxidation-free MoS2 films, focusing on interface analysis. Through a sulfurization-free solution process and single-step annealing, the oxidation-free MoS2 film is successfully prepared on Si3N4 surfaces, showing improved uniformity with a surface roughness below 0.5 nm and a thickness of 4 nm at a precursor solution concentration of 30 mM, annealed between 700 and 800&#186;C. The MoS2 films exhibit a hexagonal lattice structure with crystallographic orientations of (1 1 0 0) and (1 2 1 0) with lattice spacings of 0.27 nm and 0.16 nm respectively. Interfacial analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on SiO2 reveals migration of oxygen species as evidenced by a shift in the Si 2p spectrum at binding energies between 102.6 eV and 102.8 eV. MoS2 films on Si3N4 show a complex Si 2p peak evolution at binding energies between 100.9 and 101.8 eV, providing valuable insights into the synthesis of oxide-free MoS2 films for potential applications in advanced electronic devices.</description>

                Some intervals of the Jurassic&#8211;Cretaceous strata of the Anabar-Lena sedimentary basin have a certain oil and gas production potential, which can be realized in the synchronous offshore horizons of the adjacent territories of the Arctic shelf. Among the most representative objects in this regard are the outcrops of Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous formations of the Nordvik Peninsula. The main data on the composition and structure of this section were obtained mainly at the beginning of the second half of last century. The results of complex mineralogical, petrographic, and lithochemical studies of the Urdyuk-Khaya and Paksa formations of Cape Urdyuk-Khaya of the Nordvik Peninsula presented in here enabled us to identify 10 boundaries for changing of sedimentation regimes of the paleobasin. It was found that the Urdyuk-Khaya Formation was formed mainly in the conditions of the shelf transition zone (moderate deep water) with low rates of terrigenous material intake, some depletion of oxygen in bottom waters, and a trend towards an increase in the depths of the basin. The basal stratum of the Paksa Formation was formed in offshore conditions with periodically occurring dioxic conditions in bottom waters and extremely low rates of terrigenous material intake. The overlying part of the formation was formed in various parts of offshore transition conditions with a gradual decrease in the depths of the basin, an increase in the oxygen content in the bottom layer of water, and the rate of terrigenous material intake. The main provenance area was igneous rocks of mafic, possibly intermediate composition. There was some influence of felsic igneous rocks, or ancient sedimentary rocks rich in quartz. The parent strata were subjected to moderate and severe chemical weathering, in a warm humid climate. The revealed features of the studied strata are similar to the characteristics of the same-age sediments of the lower reaches of the Anabar River, which determines their high correlation potential and allows us to judge the evolution of the western part of the Anabar-Lena basin.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aelm.202400299</link>

                Abstract Ferroelectricity in hafnium&#8208;based materials has attracted significant research attention and is used in various applications owing to their complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor compatibility, scalability, and low&#8208;power operation. However, their widespread integration into various technologies is hindered by reliability and stability problems, particularly field&#8208;induced instability, which causes fluctuations in polarization characteristics during operation. Herein, on the underlying mechanism of field&#8208;induced instability is reported in pure hafnium oxide films within metal&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MFIS) ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). The comprehensive material analysis combined with low&#8208;frequency noise (LFN) measurements reveals that the presence of oxygen vacancies and interface traps within the ferroelectric and dielectric layers induces a charge imbalance in the FTJ, leading to distortion in its polarization characteristics and the onset of cyclic evolution in field&#8208;induced instability. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure annealing effectively mitigates field&#8208;induced instability by reducing the defects within the film, thereby alleviating the associated charge imbalance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of FTJs and provide an efficient approach to enhancing their stability.</description>

      <title>Improvement of succinate production from methane by combining rational engineering and laboratory evolution in Methylomonas sp. DH-1</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-024-02557-0</link>

                Recently, methane has been considered a next-generation carbon feedstock due to its abundance and it is main component of shale gas and biogas. Methylomonas sp. DH-1 has been evaluated as a promising industrial bio-catalyst candidate. Succinate is considered one of the top building block chemicals in the agricultural, food, and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, succinate production by Methylomonas sp. DH-1 was improved by combining adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technology with genetic engineering in the chromosome of Methylomonas sp. DH-1, such as deletion of bypass pathway genes (succinate dehydrogenase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) or overexpression of genes related with succinate production (citrate synthase, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Through ALE, the maximum consumption rate of substrate gases (methane and oxygen) and the duration maintaining high substrate gas consumption rates was enhanced compared to those of the parental strain. Based on the improved methane consumption, cell growth (OD600) increased more than twice, and the succinate titer increased by ~ 48% from 218 to 323 mg/L. To prevent unwanted succinate consumption, the succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene was deleted from the genome. The first enzyme of TCA cycle (citrate synthase) was overexpressed. Pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which produce oxaloacetate, a substrate for citrate synthase, were also overproduced by a newly identified strong promoter. The new strong promoter was screened from RNA sequencing data. When these modifications were combined in one strain, the maximum titer (702 mg/L) was successfully improved by more than three times. This study demonstrates that successful enhancement of succinic acid production can be achieved in methanotrophs through additional genetic engineering following adaptive laboratory evolution.</description>

                Sterol biosynthesis has evolved early in the history of eukaryotes. In most animals, as well as in primitive fungi, the main sterol is cholesterol. During the process of evolution, fungi acquired the ability to synthesize ergosterol. The pathway of its biosynthesis is more complex than the one of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, the evolutionary choice of most fungi was ergosterol, and the reason for this choice is still debated. In the majority of the works on this issue, the choice of most fungi is associated with the transition to life on land, and, consequently, the danger of cell dehydration. In our review we oppose this point of view. Probably, compared to cholesterol, ergosterol has more pronounced antioxidant properties. Indeed, the presence of three double bonds in the structure of the ergost&#1077;rol molecule, as compared to one in cholesterol, relatively increases the likelihood of interaction with reactive oxygen species. Perhaps, the transition to life on land required additional antioxidant protection. Due to the aforementioned structural differences, the molecule of cholesterol is apparently more flexible than that of ergosterol. Experimental data indicate that this feature provides greater membrane flexibility as compared to fungal membranes, as well as a greater ability to compensate for disturbances in the packing of membrane phospholipids. Presumably, for animal cells these qualities turned out to be relatively more important than antioxidant ones, which predetermined their evolutionary choice of sterol.</description>

      <title>The molecular composition of birch tar and its infrared spectrum</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-024-02102-5</link>

                Abstract Birch tar was the first substance made by humans that is otherwise not available in nature. The oldest artefacts date to ~ 200 thousand years ago in Europe but birch tar becomes more frequent around 45 thousand years ago and even more so from the Mesolithic onwards. Their study has important implication for our understanding of evolutionary processes such as cognitive capacity and cultural evolution. What remains unknown is the overall molecular composition of birch tar. Several approaches based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry have shown the potential of studying solvent soluble molecules to understand the botanical origin of different tars, their manufacturing techniques and their post-depositional alteration mechanisms. However, birch tar&#8217;s soluble fraction cannot shed light on its mechanical properties. In this study, we conduct gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and spectroscopic analysis of seven bulk birch tar samples, including infrared band assignment and structural refinement of organic molecules in the insoluble fraction. We find that the overall proportion that cannot be analysed by gas chromatography accounts for 85&#8211;90% in birch tar. This phase consists of polymerised molecules with a structure analogous to asphaltenes but containing a significantly greater amount of oxygen-related functional groups. Our findings have implications for understanding the viscosity, adhesiveness and stiffness of birch tar and they call for caution in applying analytical techniques that only target soluble molecules in birch tar.</description>

      <title>Genome-Wide Analysis of the Class III Peroxidase Gene Family in Physcomitrium patens and a Search for Clues to Ancient Class III Peroxidase Functions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijpb15040079</link>
      <description>Vincent P. M. Aparato, Fazle Rabbi, Taylor Madarash, Wyllie A. Brisbourne, Elizabeth I. Barker, Dae&#8208;Yeon Suh, International Journal of Plant Biology. 15(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404060254

                Plant class III peroxidases (PRXs) catalyze generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidation of various compounds including lignin precursors. PRXs function in cell wall metabolism, defense, and stress responses. However, gene redundancy and catalytic versatility have impeded detailed functional characterization of PRX genes. The genome of the model moss Physcomitrium patens harbors a relatively small number (49) of PRX genes. Conserved architecture of four exons and three &#8216;001&#8217; introns, found in some algal PRX genes and in the PpPRX family, suggests that this architecture predated divergence of the green algal and land plant lineages. The PpPRX family expanded mainly through whole-genome duplications. All duplicated pairs but one were under purifying selection and generally exhibited similar expression profiles. An expanded phylogenetic tree revealed a conserved land plant-wide clade that contained PRXs implicated in stress responses in non-lignifying cells, providing a clue to ancient functions of land plant PRXs. Functional clustering was not observed, suggesting convergent evolution of specific PRX functions (e.g., lignification) in different plant lineages. With its small complement of PRXs, P. patens may be useful for functional characterization of land plant PRXs. Several PpPRXs were proposed for further study, including PpPRX34 and PpPRX39 in the ancient land plant-wide clade.</description>

      <title>Understanding cold stress response mechanisms in plants: an overview</title>

                Low-temperature stress significantly impacts plant growth, development, yield, and geographical distribution. However, during the long-term process of evolution, plants have evolved complicated mechanisms to resist low-temperature stress. The cold tolerance trait is regulated by multiple pathways, such as the Ca 2+ signaling cascade, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1)-C-repeat binding factor (CBF)-cold-reulated gene (COR) transcriptional cascade, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis regulation, and plant hormone signaling. However, the specific responses of these pathways to cold stress and their interactions are not fully understood. This review summarizes the response mechanisms of plants to cold stress from four aspects, including cold signal perception and transduction, ICE1-CBF-COR transcription cascade regulation, ROS homeostasis regulation and plant hormone signal regulation. It also elucidates the mechanism of cold stress perception and Ca 2+ signal transduction in plants, and proposes the important roles of transcription factors (TFs), post-translational modifications (PTMs), light signals, circadian clock factors, and interaction proteins in the ICE1-CBF-COR transcription cascade. Additionally, we analyze the importance of ROS homeostasis and plant hormone signaling pathways in plant cold stress response, and explore the cross interconnections among the ICE1-CBF-COR cascade, ROS homeostasis, and plant hormone signaling. This comprehensive review enhances our understanding of the mechanism of plant cold tolerance and provides a molecular basis for genetic strategies to improve plant cold tolerance.</description>

      <title>The effects of dynamic factors inside the bubble on sono-hydrogen yield: A numerical study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0234338</link>
      <description>Liang Lv, Songsong Song, AIP Advances. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404069462

                The formation of H2 by introducing ultrasonic waves to liquid has been widely recognized as a way to provide a clean, efficient, and reliable source of H2, known as Sono-Hydro-Gen. H2 comes from the chemical effects of ultrasonic waves (sonochemistry) caused by the growth and collapse of acoustic cavitation bubbles. In this work, the effects of dynamic parameters (i.e., bubble temperature, the amount of water vapor trapped inside the bubble, and collapse time) in the evolution of cavitation bubbles on H2 production are studied numerically. For an oxygen bubble, computational simulations are performed for the wide range of acoustic amplitudes (1.5&#8211;3 atm), ultrasonic frequencies (140&#8211;515 kHz), and ambient radii (0.25&#8211;20 &#956;m), considering 22 reversible chemical reactions and 10 chemical species inside the bubble. The numerical results show that the amount of water vapor has a significant effect on the bubble collapse temperature. At low excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is not enough to cause the bubble to form a strong collapse. Nevertheless, at high excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is too much to reduce the bubble temperature. There exist optimal values of bubble temperature and amount of water vapor for H2 production. The optimal bubble temperatures are 5267, 4813, 4626, and 3856 K, corresponding to H2 productions of 4.21 &#215; 10&#8722;18, 1.29 &#215; 10&#8722;18, 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;19, and 8.48 &#215; 10&#8722;20 mol, respectively, at ultrasonic frequencies of 140, 213, 355, and 515 kHz. No matter what the excitation parameters are, the optimal water vapor fraction is 0.78 &#177; 0.04 for H2 production. The obtained results of the present work can provide guidelines for H2 production in acoustic cavitation.</description>

                Abstract. This article presents a 45-year data series (from 1978 to 2023) acquired under the IGA (&#8220;Impact des Grands Am&#233;nagements&#8221; in French; Impacts of Major Developments) program, conducted by Ifremer for EDF (&#201;lectricit&#233; de France, the French multinational electricity utility company). The IGA program was established to monitor the ecological and environmental quality of the coastal area surrounding the Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), located in the southern bight of the North Sea. The main objective of this program is to assess medium- and long-term environmental evolution by providing means to identify possible changes in the local marine habitats. Since 1978, the IGA program has measured key parameters, including temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. These measurements have been taken at different sampling stations around the NPP, including the &#8220;Canal d&#8217;amen&#233;e&#8221; sampling station, for which hydrological and biological characteristics are considered as representative of broader coastal area of the southern bight of the North Sea. This data paper provides an overview of the main statistical characteristics of the time series, including long-term trends and shifts analysis. Despite the importance and length of this dataset, one of the longest available for this region, its application in advancing knowledge of hydrological and biological processes has been surprisingly limited. The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to the scientific community, stakeholders, and society to help decipher the local and global influence of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. Since all the main statistics and patterns are still available thanks to our analysis, the user should be able to use this data and combine it with other sources (in situ, satellite, modelling), in order to dive into deeper analyses, and to investigate new key scientific challenges as well as more specific ones.</description>

      <title>New Horizons in Micro/Nanoplastic-Induced Oxidative Stress: Overlooked Free Radical Contributions and Microbial Metabolic Dysregulations in Anaerobic Digestion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08865</link>

                Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) is highly toxic to microbes. However, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and metabolic regulation within anaerobic guilds remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of environmentally relevant levels of polypropylene (PP)-MPs/NPs on oxidative stress and microbial ecology during anaerobic digestion (AD). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that PP-MPs/NPs elevated the concentrations of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and derived hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). EPFRs were identified as the primary contributors to &#8226;OH generation, as evidenced by a high Spearman correlation coefficient (r = 0.884, p &lt; 0.001) and free radical-quenching studies. The formation of &#8226;OH enhanced ROS production by 86.2&#8211;100.9%, resulting in decreased cellular viability and methane production (by 37.5&#8211;50.5%) at 100 mg/g TS PP-MPs/NPs. Genome-centric metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses suggested that PP-MPs/NPs induced the reassembly of community structures, re-evolution of functional traits, and remodeling of interspecies interactions. Specifically, PP-MPs/NPs induced a shift in methanogen consortia from hydrogenotrophic Methanofollis sp. to acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic Methanothrix soehngenii, primarily because of the latter's diverse ingestion patterns, electron bifurcation complexes, and ROS-scavenging abilities. Downregulation of genes associated with antioxidative defense systems (i.e., sodN, katA, and osmC) and ROS-driven redox signal transduction pathways (c-di-AMP and phosphorylation signaling pathways) provided insights into the mechanisms underlying ROS-induced microbial metabolic dysregulation. Our findings enhance the understanding of microbial ecological and metabolic traits under MPs/NPs stressors, facilitating the control of MPs/NPs toxicity and the stabilization of AD processes.</description>

                Aims &amp; Objectives: HFOV is a ventilatory strategy that can be applied as rescue therapy for patients with PARDS when there is limited access to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The behavior of chronic hepatic failure patients with pulmonary disease in HFOV is insufficiently reported. Methods: We described ventilatory parameters, gasometrical and oxygenation variables, and organ dysfunction scores on first 3 days of HFOV and outcome data [PICU length-of-stay (LOS), total HFOV days and ventilation-free days] for patients with chronic hepatic failure and PARDS. Results: 5 patients with chronic hepatic failure were submitted to HFOV from January 2020 to January 2023. All patients had Biliary Atresia. 60% were boys, median age was 7 (5-24) months. Median PIM-3 score was 27.5% (0.5-80) and median pre-HFOV PELOD-2 score was 8 (7-12). Median pre-HFOV Oxygen Saturation Index (OSI) was 25 (15-26) and median pre-HFOV PaCO2 was 104 (86-154). Evolution of PaCO2 and ISO are shown in Figure 1. Median PICU LOS was 15 (5-35) days, median HFOV duration was 3 (1-8) days. Ventilation-free days varied from 0 to 9 days and 3 patients (60%) died. OSI, PaCO2 (Figure 1) and daily PELOD-2 scores showed a tendency towards improvement.Conclusions: Knowledge towards the behavior of chronic hepatic failure patients submitted to alternative modes of mechanical ventilation is crucial. Particularities such as the presence of ascites and coagulopathy can have impacts on how these patients respond to HFOV. Despite a tendency towards gasometrical and oxygenation index improvement, inferences on robust outcomes could not be made given high mortality and small sample-size.

      <title>Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH as a High&#8208;Performance Catalyst for Hydrogen&#8208;Enhanced Fenton Oxidation of Trimethoprim</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aoc.7872</link>
      <description>Q Qi Chen, Xiaojie Shen, Y. J. Wang, Ying Gao, Feng Liu, Jianhua Wu, Xiaowen Wang, Long Yi Jin, San&#8208;Jian Ma, Juanhong Li, Zixia Lin, Hongwei Yang, Xin Liu, Applied Organometallic Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404081567

                ABSTRACT A novel catalyst material named Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH was successfully developed and applied in a hydrogen&#8208;promoted Fenton system for the efficient catalytic oxidation of the widely used antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP). The UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH, as the carrier of catalyst in this work, was synthesized through a solvothermal method. The Pd 0 nanoparticle, as the active center of the catalyst, was loaded onto its surface by the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy. The results showed that the composite Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH demonstrated excellent catalytic performance during the reaction, achieving over 97% of TMP removal efficiency within 180 min under optimal conditions under the condition of only trace of iron without adding H 2 O 2 . This may be attributed to the fact that the [H], as a clean and efficient reducing agent, can be utilized to accelerate the regeneration of Fe 2+ in the Fenton reaction, as well as in the in&#8208;situ regeneration of H 2 O 2 . The key parameters affecting the removal efficiency of TMP, including the initial pH and concentration of Fe 2+ , the dosage of the synthesized material, the flow rate of H 2 and the stirring speed were investigated systematically. The Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH exhibited high stability and reusability, maintaining over 82% of its initial degradation efficiency of TMP after six reaction cycles. The mechanistic insight revealed that the system primarily relied on the generation of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) for the degradation of TMP, which was verified through quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR). The degradation pathway of TMP was elucidated by analyzing intermediates and the reduction in total organic carbon (TOC). This research offers novel conceptual insights into the evolution and application of advanced oxidation technologies, efficient degradation of emerging pollutants, and expansion of pathways for hydrogen resource utilization.</description>
