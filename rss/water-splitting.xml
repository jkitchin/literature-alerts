      <title>Seawater alkalization via an energy-efficient electrochemical process for CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2410841121</link>
      <description>Xun Guan, Ge Zhang, Jinlei Li, Sang Cheol Kim, Guangxia Feng, Yuqi Li, Tony Cui, Adam Brest, Yi Cui, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 121(45)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403824379

                Electrochemical pH-swing strategies offer a promising avenue for cost-effective and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture, surpassing the traditional thermally activated processes and humidity-sensitive techniques. The concept of elevating seawater&#8217;s alkalinity for scalable CO 2 capture without introducing additional chemical as reactant is particularly intriguing due to its minimal environmental impact. However, current commercial plants like chlor-alkali process or water electrolysis demand high thermodynamic voltages of 2.2 V and 1.23 V, respectively, for the production of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) from seawater. These high voltages are attributed to the asymmetric electrochemical reactions, where two completely different reactions take place at the anode and cathode. Here, we developed a symmetric electrochemical system for seawater alkalization based on a highly reversible and identical reaction taking place at the anode and cathode. We utilize hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, where the generated hydrogen is looped to the anode for hydrogen oxidation reaction. Theoretical calculations indicate an impressively low energy requirement ranging from 0.07 to 0.53 kWh/kg NaOH for established pH differences of 1.7 to 13.4. Experimentally, we achieved the alkalization with an energy consumption of 0.63 kWh/kg NaOH, which is only 38% of the theoretical energy requirements of the chlor-alkali process (1.64 kWh/kg NaOH). Further tests demonstrated the system&#8217;s potential of enduring high current densities (~20 mA/cm 2 ) and operating stability over an extended period (&gt;110 h), showing its potential for future applications. Notably, the CO 2 adsorption tests performed with alkalized seawater exhibited remarkably improved CO 2 capture dictated by the production of hydroxide compared to the pristine seawater.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Ir Single Atoms on Reconstructed Mn&#9472;NiOOH for Enhanced Catalytic Performance in Urea&#8208;Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202406786</link>
      <description>Quynh Phuong Ngo, Sampath Prabhakaran, Do Hwan Kim, Byoung&#8208;Suhk Kim, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403825820

                Abstract Investigating advanced electrocatalysts is crucial for improving the efficacy of water splitting to generate environmentally friendly fuel. The discovery of highly effective electrocatalysts, capable of driving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea&#8208;alkaline environments, is pivotal for advancing large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. This study aims to introduce a new method that involves creating nanosheets of high&#8208;loading iridium single atoms embedded in a manganese&#8208;containing nickel oxyhydroxide matrix (Ir@Mn&#9472;NiOOH). These nanostructures are derived from self&#8208;supported hydrate pre&#8208;catalyst nanosheets grown on nickel foam and then activated through electrochemical etching pretreatment. The Ir@Mn&#9472;NiOOH nanoarchitecture displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity, having a low overpotential of just 258 mV and a potential of 1.319 V (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) for OER and UOR, respectively. Such extraordinary catalytic characteristics of Ir@Mn&#9472;NiOOH is mainly owing to the strong synthetic electronic interaction between Ir single atoms and Mn&#9472;NiOOH, which can change its electronic characteristics and boost electrochemical catalytic sites. This research presents a new way to produce exceptionally efficient catalysts by adding a synergistic effect to complex multi&#8208;electron processes.</description>

                The conversion of renewable energy sources with relatively large energy fluctuations into hydrogen represents a crucial aspect of energy storage. Nevertheless, the direct water electrolysis process is known to require excessive instantaneous energy consumption and high cost. Two-step alkaline water electrolysis is regarded as a secure and effective method of generating hydrogen from renewable energy sources when compared to direct water electrolysis. Here we propose a two-step alkaline water electrolysis using nickel-cobalt based hydroxide (Ni</description>

                Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts require the reasonable integration of geometric architecture, defects construction and interfacial electronic structure, which is difficult to combine multiple advantages into one low-cost catalysts.

      <title>One-Step Scalable Synthesis of 3D Self-Supported Superaerophobic Ce-Coupled Ni3S2/NiS@NF Nanobud Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14110752</link>
      <description>Mengjie Lu, Run Cheng, Sheng Wang, Dandan Liang, Meng Qin, Bili Wang, Rui Song, Duo Chen, Catalysts. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403835596

                The elaborate design of inexpensive, high-performance electrocatalysts from earth-abundant elements toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical in various (electro)chemical processes. Herein, a novel binder-free catalyst of Ce-coupled Ni3S2/NiS supported on Ni foam (Ce-Ni3S2/NiS@NF) is successfully synthesized via a facile one-step hydrothermal method that enables practical feasibility with a significant enhancement of OER activity through anchoring Ce dopants on an Ni3S2/NiS nanobud host. Ce species coupling can modulate electronic structure, which reduces the reaction energy barrier and optimizes OER catalytic activity. More profoundly, the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties of the Ce-Ni3S2/NiS@NF electrode further promote mass transfer. As a result, the Ce-Ni3S2/NiS@NF electrode exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 236 and 350 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and long-term durability for 24 h in alkaline medium. These results could supply valuable guidelines for the design of other OER catalysts and beyond.</description>

      <title>Metal Imidazole-Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29215076</link>
      <description>Meng Xia, Xinxin Yu, Zhuangzhuang Wu, Yuzhen Zhao, Lijuan Feng, Qi Chen, Molecules. 29(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403837043

                Since the product contains no carbon-based substances and can be driven by non-carbon-based electricity, electrocatalytic water splitting is considered to be among the most effective strategies for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental pollution. This process helps lower greenhouse gas emissions while also supporting the shift toward renewable energy sources. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a more complex multi-electron transfer process, which is the principal limiting factor in overall water splitting. Extensive research has demonstrated that the controlled design of effective electrocatalysts can address this limitation. In this study, a previously unreported covalent organic framework material (COF-IM) was synthesized via a post-synthetic modification strategy. Notably, COF-IM contains imidazole nitrogen metal active sites. Transition metal-coordinated COF-IM@Co can function as a highly effective electrocatalyst, exhibiting a lower overpotential (403.8 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in alkaline electrolytes, thereby highlighting its potential for practical applications in energy conversion technologies. This study offers new perspectives on the design and synthesis of COFs, while also making substantial contributions to the advancement and application of OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Novel synthesis of CuHCF/B-rGO composites for oxygen evolution reaction activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75605-9</link>

                In this work, we have focused on the preparation of copper hexacyanoferrate/boron doped rGO composites (abbreviated as CuHCF/B-rGO) by employing simple co-precipitation technique subsequently processed with ultrasonication method. The XRD spectra confirmed the existence of the cubic structure of copper hexacyanoferrate with high crystalline peaks. The prepared nanocomposite morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confirmed CuHCF nanoparticles formation with flake-like and wrinkled sheets. Pure CuHCF nanostructures revealed good OER action at 430 mV to obtain 10 mA/cm2. The obtained CuHCF product OER activity can be further upgraded by incorporating the electrically conductive boron doped reduced graphene oxide matrix into CuHCF nanostructures, for the reason that the overpotential of the CuHCF/B-rGO was reduced to 380 mV to attain 10 mA/cm2 with 88 mV/dec Tafel slope value. The doping of heteroatom considerably improves charge-transfer resistance of metal hexacyanoferrate, giving a small resistance value of 2.97 &#937;, which was lower than that of CuHCF (5.57 &#937;) and CuHCF/rGO (4.31 &#937;). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of the CuHCF/B-rGO was stable at prolonged hours with a small decay of 12.5%. Therefore, this work offers new approach to stimulate the catalytic performance of metal hexcyanoferrate by highly conductive carbon-based materials for water splitting performance.</description>

                Abstract Green hydrogen production from water splitting is a feasible way for intermittent renewable energy storage and utilization, where the exploration and scale&#8208;up preparation of high&#8208;performance anodic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are critical prerequisites for its industrial&#8208;level applications. Herein, a chemical bath deposition of FeNi 3 intermetallic alloys onto Ni mesh support is performed, which delivers a current density of 0.62 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.72 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for alkaline water oxidation in 1 m KOH and an excellent electrolysis stability at 0.2 A cm &#8722;2 for over 300 h. Moreover, via 3D computational fluid dynamics simulation and flow field optimization, a homogeneous deposition of &#8776;5400 cm 2 NiFe anode is demonstrated within 4 min using the developed flow bath reactor. Once integrating the as&#8208;prepared NiFe anodes into alkaline electrolyzer stack, the voltage variation between each unit cell is below 40 mV at a total operation current of 71 A, or ca. current density of 0.2 A cm &#8722;2 , confirming the uniformity of this batch synthesis protocol and its great potential for industrial alkaline water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract In recent years, efforts have been made to adapt secondary metal-air batteries for practical rechargeable applications through the development of bifunctional catalysts, which are highly active in both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Molybdenum carbides, known for their high chemical durability and electrical conductivity, are being investigated as electrode materials for hydrogen evolution reactions in water electrolysis. In this study we found a new wet-chemical synthesis of cobalt-molybdenum-based carbides. Especially, the synthesized Mn-doped Co&#8323;(Mo&#8320;.&#8329;Mn&#8320;.&#8321;)&#8323;C catalyst gave a remarkable activity for both OER and ORR, showing significant potential for the advancement of metal-air batteries as secondary batteries.</description>

                Efficient catalysts are imperative to accelerate the slow oxygen reaction kinetics for the development of emerging electrochemical energy systems ranging from room-temperature alkaline water electrolysis to high-temperature ceramic fuel cells. In this work, we reveal the role of cationic inductive interactions in predetermining the oxygen vacancy concentrations of 235 cobalt-based and 200 iron-based perovskite catalysts at different temperatures, and this trend can be well predicted from machine learning techniques based on the cationic lattice environment, requiring no heavy computational and experimental inputs. Our results further show that the catalytic activity of the perovskites is strongly correlated with their oxygen vacancy concentration and operating temperatures. We then provide a machine learning-guided route for developing oxygen electrocatalysts suitable for operation at different temperatures with time efficiency and good prediction accuracy. Catalyst screening is an important process but it's usually time-consuming and labor intensive. Here the authors report the prediction of oxygen vacancy for perovskites using machine learning techniques to develop suitable oxygen electrocatalysts for solid oxide fuel cells at reduced temperatures.</description>

                Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalytic materials for hydrogen production through water splitting offer advantages in terms of price and availability compared to noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, among which, Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based compounds are the most typical and widely studied materials. Utilizing the synergistic effects between composite components in compounds containing multiple metal elements is an important way to improve the catalytic performance of catalysts, so developing ternary or multiple active center catalysts containing Fe, Co, and Ni is a promising direction. In this mini&#8208;review, we provide an summary of the latest achievements of water splitting catalyst materials simultaneously containing Fe, Co, and Ni elements. It was summarized according to several groups including compounds of boron&#8208;/carbon&#8208;/nitrogen&#8208;/phosphorus&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;group elements, metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;based compounds, and compounds in situ grown from alloy matrix. Also challenges that need to be addressed are presented at the end of the article.</description>

                The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8208;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC) surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8208;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0 M KOH solution, Co2P&#8208;WO3&#8208;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32 mV dec&#8208;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8208;x can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt (Co)&#8208;based oxides show promising activity as precious metal&#8208;free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but the dissolution of Co has limited the durability of Co 3 O 4 at industrially relevant current densities. This work demonstrates that cation in an octahedral coordination environment accounts for the oxygen evolution activity. Using a mixed inverse&#8208;normal phase spinel Co x Ga (3&#8208; x ) O 4 as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the designed Co 2+ &#8208;O&#8208;Co 3+ motifs in octahedral sites trigger oxygen evolution through a kinetically favorable radical coupling pathway. Furthermore, lattice oxygen exchange, a leading factor in catalyst structural degradation for normal Co 3 O 4 , is suppressed, as evidenced by isotopic labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. With the optimized catalyst, Co 1.8 Ga 1.2 O 4 , an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 is reported, with stable operation at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 for 200 h in a three&#8208;electrode setup, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer operating at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 for 450 h.</description>

                Abstract Because of its low cost and abundant sources, hydrogen serves as a clean energy alternative capable of successfully substituting fossil fuels. A highly efficient method for generating hydrogen energy currently is by the electrolysis of water. The oxygen&#8208;extraction reaction (OER), a component of water electrolysis, requires a complex chemical pathway that involves multiproton and multielectron interactions. To enhance reaction efficiency in the OER process, catalysts are crucial; thus, the search for high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective catalysts is underway. This experimental study involved the enhancement of the five&#8208;membered high&#8208;entropy oxide (FeCoNiMnCu) 3 O 3.2 by incorporating a sixth group element (Zn, Al). The organization, morphology, and OER properties were analyzed following the preparation utilizing a mechanical ball milling process. A series of rock salt&#8208;type hexagonal high entropy oxides with differing ball milling durations were synthesized to investigate the influence of the production method on the surface shape and catalytic properties of high entropy oxides. The results indicated that the single&#8208;phase rock salt structure of (FeCoNiMnCuAl) 3 O 3.5 , a high&#8208;entropy oxide, exhibited significantly altered diffraction peaks, hence improving OER performance. Optimization of the preparation technique revealed that a 72&#8208;h ball milling duration resulted in an overpotential of merely 293 mV and an electrochemically active surface area approximately double that of the other milling durations.</description>

                The design of highly efficient catalysts to enhance the kinetics of oxygen reduction (OER) and oxygen evolution (ORR) reactions is the key issue for the development of high-performance Zn-air battery. In this work, we report the design of Co-CoTe heterostructured fibers as the bifunctional oxygen catalyst for Zn-air battery. Firstly, the theoretical analysis was carried out on Co-CoTe heterostructure. The large work function difference is favorable to construct strong interfacial built-in electric field (BIEF), and the low energy barrier endows high catalytic activities. Moreover, the in-situ grown carbon shell was designed to build "core-shell" Co-CoTe/C unit to realize its high performance. They assemble the Co-CoTe@HFS fiber with good self-supporting and flexible features. Taken the advantages of the strong BIEF, the "core-shell" basic unit, and the freestanding substrate, the Co-CoTe@HFS fiber achieves the good electrocatalytic properties and high reliability. The full Zn-air battery (ZAB) with the Co/CoTe@HFS air cathode achieves the high peak power density and cycling stability over long-term cycling. Therefore, this work provides a clue to design bifunctional oxygen catalysts for high-performance ZABs.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalysts based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) attracted significant attention for water splitting, while the transition between MOFs and metal oxyhydroxide poses a great challenge in identifying authentic active sites and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we employ on&#8208;purpose defect engineering to create high&#8208;density atomic level defects on two&#8208;dimensional Fe&#8208;MOFs. The coordination number of Fe changes from 6 to 4.46, and over 28% of unsaturated Fe sites are formed in the optimized Fe&#8208;MOF. In situ characterizations of the most optimized Fe&#8208;MOF 0.3 electrocatalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process using Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed that some Fe unsaturated sites become oxidized with a concomitant dissociation of water molecules, causing generation of the crucial *OH intermediates and Fe oxyhydroxide. Moreover, the presence of Fe oxyhydroxide is compatible with the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, which lower its energy barrier and accelerate the kinetics. As a result, the optimized Fe&#8208;MOF electrodes delivered remarkable OER (259 mV at 10 mA cm -2 ) and HER (36 mV at 10 mA cm -2 ) performance. Our study offers comprehensive understanding of the effect of phase transformation on the electrocatalytic process of MOF&#8208;based materials.</description>

                Abstract The current limitations in utilizing metal-organic frameworks for (photo)electrochemical applications stem from their diminished electrochemical stability. In our study, we illustrate a method to bolster the activity and stability of (photo)electrocatalytically active metal-organic frameworks through ligand engineering. We synthesize four distinct mixed-ligand versions of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, and conduct a comprehensive investigation into the structural evolution and self-reconstruction during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions. In contrast to the conventional single-ligand ZIF, where the framework undergoes a complete transformation into CoOOH via a stepwise oxidation, the ligand-engineered zeolitic imidazolate frameworks manage to preserve the fundamental framework structure by in-situ forming a protective cobalt (oxy)hydroxide layer on the surface. This surface reconstruction facilitates both conductivity and catalytic activity by one order of magnitude and considerably enhances the (photo)electrochemical stability. This work highlights the vital role of ligand engineering for designing advanced and stable metal-organic frameworks for photo- and electrocatalysis.</description>

      <description>Na Sun, Xiuwen Si, Xiaoqi Wei, Xue Zhou, Yu Han, Fu Ding, Xiangru Kong, Ya&#8208;Guang Sun, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403953999

                Abstract Elucidating the correlation of active sites and catalytic activity in multi&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is key to understanding the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet it remains nebulous. Herein, a direct pathway combining theoretical prediction with anchoring high&#8208;valence metals is proposed on MOFs to reveal the mechanism of the OER reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that the co&#8208;modulation by Mo and Co atoms can enhance the conductance of CoMOF and optimize the adsorption&#8208;free energies of the OER intermediates. Guided by the theoretical prediction, the Co&#8208;based MOFs grown on Ni foams are doped with high valence Mo, which is used as model catalysts for the quantitative study of the composition&#8208;dependent OER performance. With Co/Mo in the ratio of 5:1 for the highest OER activity (impressively overpotential of 324 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 96.07 mV dec &#8722;1 ) and excellent stability (maintains for 200 h at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ), the catalysts in this work is superior to commercial benchmarks electrocatalysts (RuO 2 /NF, 420 mV, 199.12 mV dec &#8722;1 ). This work sheds light on the tailoring of the active sites of MOFs, which is highly correlated with the activity of the OER.</description>

                Abstract Developing economical and efficient electrocatalysts is critical for hydrogen energy industrialization through water electrolysis. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;site synergistic NiFe/Y 2 O 3 hybrid with abundant interfacial Ni/Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Y bonds is designed by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. In situ Raman spectra combined with DFT calculations reveal that the interfacial Ni/Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Y units greatly promote H 2 O dissociation and optimize the adsorption of both H* and oxygen species, achieving excellent activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction. As expected, NiFe/Y 2 O 3 exhibits a low overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and robust stability of over 200 h at 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 , and also outstanding water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.64 V at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , showing significant potential for real&#8208;world applications.</description>

      <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417987</link>

                Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO), fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.87 kWh Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50 kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Carbon Paper Electrocatalysts in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma Jet Treatment</title>

                NiMoO4 was grown on carbon paper (CP) by a hydrothermal method. A rapid and high-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) process was used to generate more oxygen-deficient NiMoO4 on the CP surface to serve as an electrode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After 60 s of APPJ treatment, the overpotential of the electrode at 100 mA/cm2 decreased to 790 mV and that at 10 mA/cm2 decreased to 368 mV. Additionally, the charge transfer resistance decreased from 2.8 to 1.2 &#937;, indicating that APPJ treatment effectively reduced the electrode overpotential and impedance. The effect of NiMoO4/CP/APPJ-60 s on the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) system was also tested. At a system temperature of 70 &#176;C and current density of 100 mA/cm2, the energy efficiency reached 95.1%, and the specific energy consumption decreased from 4.02 to 3.83 kWh/m3. These results demonstrate that the APPJ-treated NiMoO4/CP electrode can effectively enhance the OER performance in water electrolysis and improve the energy efficiency of the AEMWE system. This approach shows promise in replacing precious metal electrodes, thereby potentially reducing the cost and providing an environmentally friendly alternative.</description>

                Abstract Research on the production and utilization of hydrogen energy is essential to overcome the environmental issues caused by fossil fuels. Herein, we anchor Pt&#63743;Ni nanoalloy clusters (Pt&#8208;Ni NACs) on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene oxide (NrGO) by a facile microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis and analyze the variations of catalyst properties based on the Pt&#63743;Ni composition and the presence of nitrogen. Ni inclusion in the Pt matrix can induce lattice strain and change the electronic structure, while the doped nitrogen into the graphene can enhance electron transfer and improve the durability of the catalyst through strong chemical bonding with the alloy clusters. TEM analysis discovers that the NACs are uniformly decorated in a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;size on the graphene surface, and the formation of the Pt&#63743;Ni NACs and structural changes according to composition are confirmed through XRD and XPS. In addition, the structural changes due to N&#8208;doping and its bonding with the NACs are observed through Raman spectroscopy and XPS. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO exhibits the highest ORR onset potential (0.893 V) and the lowest HER overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 (22 mV) among other catalysts, and those activities are almost unchanged under long&#8208;term durability tests. From these results, Pt 2.6 Ni NACs/NrGO is utilized in a zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) system, demonstrating better battery performance than commercial Pt and Ir&#8208;based catalysts. Moreover, it is applied to hydrogen collection, showing linear trend in hydrogen production over time, confirming the catalyst's availability in hydrogen production and utilization. image</description>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemical solar to hydrogen production is a promising way to achieve carbon neutrality, but severe charge recombination in photoanodes limits the conversion efficiency. Herein, Au nanoparticles and Co(OH) x co&#8208;sensitized bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) to construct AuCo(OH) x /BiVO 4 photoanode for significantly enhancing the performance of photoelectrochemical water splitting. This process significantly improves the bulk charge carrier separation efficiency, the surface kinetics of water oxidation, and the electron density of BiVO 4 photoanode through Au surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and Co(OH) x oxygen evolution catalysts effect. Additionally, the enhancement of the *O and the *OOH generation accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Consequently, the constructed AuCo(OH) x /BiVO 4 photoanode demonstrates an excellent photocurrent of 6.2 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and a stable continuous output within 42 h. This work contributes to developing high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;stability photoanodes for solar H 2 production through SPR effect and oxygen evolution catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Design of highly efficient cost effective and self-supported bi-functional electrocatalyst for the production of green Hydrogen is significant for renewable and sustainable energy conversion to achieve future carbon neutral. Meanwhile, as we know that the overall water splitting is an uphill reaction requires 285.8 kJ of energy, corresponds to the HHV of hydrogen, state-of-the-art developments are necessary to greatly improve the efficiency by rationally designing non-precious metal-based robust bi-functional catalysts for promoting both the cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic oxygen evolution reactions. The performance of metal phosphide towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution was examined under application relevant conditions in an alkaline and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer cell stack. The in-house designed stacked electrolyzer exhibited stable performances with a hydrogen production rate of few Nm3 per hour without any decay, pave the path towards large scale application with substantial reduction in CAPEX and OPEX cost.

      <title>Assigning surface hole polaron configurations of titanium oxide materials to excited state optical absorptions</title>

                For water splitting, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying reaction intermediates and pathways is crucial for optimizing existing materials or discovering novel ones. Among the most well-known active photoanodes for the oxygen evolution half-reaction are various TiO2-based materials. A hole polaron, which consists of a metal-oxide distortion around trapped holes, has been suggested as a local reactive oxygen configuration for the oxidative reaction. While first principal calculations identify new electronic states in the middle of the band gap due to hole-polarons and the influence of hole-polaron dynamics on transport, an assignment of hole-polaron configurations to a measured spectrum has been challenging due to broad optical transitions in the visible regime. Here, we compare the excited state absorption (ESA) for two titanium oxide materials with a similar electronic structure, but different titanium-oxide crystal structure and find that the maximum in the broad spec-trum shifts from 3.1 eV in rutile TiO2 (100) to 2.2 eV in perovskite SrTiO3. A principal component analysis isolates the ESA generated at ultra-fast timescales (&lt; 1 ps) in the pump-probe spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations predict the energies of the mid-gap states for stable hole-polarons and the corresponding spectra from the valence band, respectively. When compared to the experimental spectra, we can rationalize the shift in the ESA by the transition optical dipole, considering both the edge and deeper states in the valence band, being bright for certain configurations of hole polarons in rutile TiO2 (100) (terminal O&#8226;-) and STO (lateral Ti2O&#8226;-). The spectral assignment of the ESA in two transition metal oxides materials via their distinctive crystal structures paves the way for the assignment of hole-polaron configurations and their dynamics in other transition metal oxides for oxygen evolution catalysis and more-generally, photo-driven processes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating nonmetal atom doping in two-dimensional VSe2 monolayers for hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis</title>

                The electrocatalytic performance of VSe2 doped with nonmetals (NMs) was studied using density functional theory, in which NM atoms (C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I) replaced Se or V (denoted as NM@Se or NM@V). Notably, P@V and Br@V monolayers exhibit high catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity with the lowest &#916;GH* = 0.08 eV and &#8722;0.03 eV, respectively, surpassing Pt (&#916;GH* = &#8722;0.1 eV). By applying the scaling relationship of &#916;GH* of H*, which is an intermediate for each volcano, the exchange current density diagrams are established. Based on thermodynamic analysis, P@V and Br@V monolayers produce exchange currents of about &#8722;1.42 and &#8722;0.70i0/(A cm&#8722;2), respectively. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of the I@Se monolayer (&#951;OER = 0.95 V) is the best among all the monolayers. Among the oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, the O@Se monolayer displays high activity with a low &#951;ORR (0.82 V), which is even better than that of binary Pt and Pd alloys (0.9&#8211;0.87 V).</description>

                Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are emerging as one of the most promising candidates with superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, their fabrication under mild conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a low-cost, high-production-rate strategy for controlled preparation of AlOOH/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with strong adsorption capacity for transition metal cations, and then in-situ conversion to CoAl-LDH/rGO, NiAl-LDH/rGO and FeAl-LDH/rGO under ambient conditions. Based on Density Functional Theory calculations, it is witnessed that the rational electronic coordination between Co and Al enables the charge absorption by surrounding oxygen atoms, thereby playing a critical role in reducing the adsorption free energy and overpotential of OER intermediates toward efficient OER. Consequently, the resultant CoAl-LDH/rGO hybrids exhibit an overpotential of just 368 mV at the current density of 100 mA/cm</description>

      <title>Photocarrier Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Aza-Fused Covalent Organic Frameworks as Bifunctional Photocatalysts toward Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Designing high-efficiency bifunctional photocatalysts toward photoinduced overall water splitting is one of the most promising and challenging research directions for clean energy generation. By employing static electronic structure calculation and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation, we herein established a recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) aza-fused covalent organic framework (aza-COF) as a potential bifunctional photocatalyst toward overall water splitting reactions. Our calculated results reveal that the overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction are only 0.06 and 0.31 V, respectively, at pH = 4. The dynamics of photoexcited charge carriers studied through NAMD simulation predicts the electron&#8211;hole recombination time (25.15 ns), and this confirms that the photogenerated electron and hole carriers migrate to the active sites for the occurrence of reaction before they recombine. Therefore, our results suggest that the 2D aza-COFs exhibit great potential as metal-free and single-material photocatalysts toward overall water splitting under visible light.</description>

                Earth-abundant transition metal phosphide (TMP) nanomaterials have gained significant attention as potential replacements for Pt-based electrocatalysts in green energy applications, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. In particular, FeP nanostructures exhibit superior electrical conductivity and high stability. Moreover, their diverse composition and unique crystal structures position FeP nanomaterials as emerging candidates for HER electrocatalysts. However, the synthesis or fabrication method employed for FeP nanostructures can significantly affect their overall electrocatalytic properties. For example, the solution synthesis of pure-phase FeP nanostructures remains challenging due to the formation of multiple binary phases and undesirable agglomeration. In this work, we use a simple approach to synthesizing FeP nanobundles by reacting &#946;-FeOOH (iron oxyhydroxide) with trioctylphosphine (TOP). FeP nanobundles were evaluated as HER electrocatalysts in both acidic and basic conditions, demonstrating good HER activity with overpotential values of 170 and 338 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm</description>

      <title>Modulating Electrolyte Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Voltage and Low&#8208;Temperature Magnesium&#8208;ion Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/batt.202400620</link>

                Aqueous electrolytes supercapacitors have great potential in energy storage devices due to their high&#8208;power density and safety. However, due to the water hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the electrochemical stabilization window of aqueous electrolytes needs to be widened. Moreover, the application of aqueous electrolyte at low temperature is often limited by the freezing point of water. In this paper, we modulate the solvation structure of aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion supercapacitors by using sulfolane as a co&#8208;solvent. The modulated low salt concentration hybrid electrolyte extends the electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte to 2.9V and enhances the stability of the electrolyte at extreme temperatures, as well as provides safe and non&#8208;flammable properties. Based on the hybrid electrolyte, the water&#8208;organic hybrid magnesium&#8208;ion supercapacitors (HMSCs) are able to operate within an enlarged voltage range of 0 &#8211; 2.2 V at a low temperature of &#8208;30&#176;C. The HMSC shows a specific capacitance of up to 58 F/g at room temperature and retains a specific capacitance of 39 F/g at a current density of 15 A/g. Furthermore, it has an outstanding cycling performance at &#8208;30 &#176;C, maintaining a specific capacitance of more than 92% after 20,000 cycles.</description>

                Abstract Sustainable electrochemical energy generation requires cost-effective, noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen production in electrolyzers. This study used electrodeposition to create crystalline NiB films with different boron (B) contents&#8212;Ni-B(1.17 wt.%), Ni-B(1.06 wt.%), Ni-B(0.94 wt.%), and Ni-B(0.89 wt.%)&#8212;on FTO substrates. These films were tested as bifunctional electrocatalyst electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The NiB films' composition and morphology were analyzed using SEM, AFM, XRD, GD-OES, and XPS. Linear sweep voltammetry assessed their electrocatalytic performance. Higher B content in the films promoted the formation of electroactive NiOOH, enhancing the OER. The Ni-B(1.17 wt.%) electrode required an overpotential of 380 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; for OER, while the Ni-B(1.06 wt.%) electrode required 146 mV for the same current density for HER. An alkaline water electrolyzer using Ni-B(1.17 wt.%) as the anode and Ni-B(1.06 wt.%) as the cathode achieved a current density of 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; at 1.71 V for overall water splitting. The system showed stability over 12 hours of testing. The results indicate that NiB films on FTO substrates are promising, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis, offering an alternative to noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Light-driven water splitting by plants, algae and cyanobacteria is pivotal for global bioenergetics and biomass formation. A manganese cluster bound to the photosystem-II proteins catalyzes the complex reaction at high rate, but the rate-determining factors are insufficiently understood. Here we traced the oxygen-evolution transition by time-resolved polarography and infrared spectroscopy for cyanobacterial photosystems genetically modified at two strategic sites, complemented by computational chemistry. We conclude three rate-determining functions of the protein environment of the metal cluster: acceleration of proton-coupled electron transfer, acceleration of substrate-water insertion after O2-formation, and balancing of rate-determining enthalpic and entropic contributions. Whereas in general the substrate-water insertion step may be unresolvable in time-resolved experiments, here it likely became traceable because of deceleration by genetic modification. Our results may stimulate new time-resolved experiments on substrate-water insertion in photosynthesis, clarification of enthalpy-entropy compensation in enzyme catalysis, and knowledge-guided development of inorganic catalyst materials.</description>

                An energy transition to renewable energy sources is necessary due to the scarcity of fossil fuels and their detrimental effects on the environment. Water splitting process is one of the practical and effective way that does not occur spontaneously. This study investigates catalytic activity of Cu-Zn-Sn (CZT) photocatalyst in hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction. The CZT deposited with varied electrolyte&#8217;s pH of 6 and 9 on indium tin oxide substrate at the room temperature for 600 seconds. According to the X-ray diffraction patterns, there were Cu6Sn5, Cu5Zn8, and Sn metal phases with monoclinic, cubic, and cubic crystal systems. The scanning electron microscopy technique results of all CZT alloy sample showed a dense, non-uniform, and polycrystalline surface structure. The CZT alloys were found to have an average particle size of 0.35 &#956;m. CZT alloys can produce a photocurrent density of 0.19 mA/cm&#178; at a potential of 1.29 V vs RHE. the charge transfer resistance of CZT synthesized at pH 6 is lower (21.48 &#937;) compared to pH 9 (28.36 &#937;). The Tafel slope of HER for pH 9 CZT was -133 mV/dec, which was lower than that of pH 6 CZT (-88 mV/dec), indicating faster H2 production and corrosion resistance on pH 9 CZT.</description>

                Abstract Borophene, an anisotropic metallic Dirac material exhibits superlative physical and chemical properties. While the lack of bandgap restricts its electronic chip applications, insufficient charge carrier density and electrochemical/catalytically active sites, restricts its energy storage and catalysis applications. Fluorination of borophene can induce bandgap and yield local electron injection within its crystallographic lattice. Herein, a facile synthesis of fluoroborophene with tunable fluorine content through potassium fluoride&#8208;assisted solvothermal&#8208;sonochemical combinatorial approach is reported. Fluoroborophene monolayers with lateral dimension 50 nm&#8211;5 &#181;m are synthesized having controlled fluorine content (12&#8211;35%). Fluoroborophene exhibits inter&#8208;twinned crystallographic structure, with fluorination&#8208;tunable visible&#8208;range bandgap &#8776;1.5&#8211;2.5 eV, and density functional theory calculations also corroborate it. Fluoroborophene is explored for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium and bestow a good stability. Tunable bandgap, electrophilicity and molecular anchoring capability of fluoroborophene will open opportunities for novel electronic/optoelectronic/spintronic chips, energy storage devices, and in numerous catalytic applications.</description>

                Abstract Compared to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) generally exhibits a lower overpotential during the electrolytic process, which is conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. The superior structure and abundant sites play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of urea molecules. Therefore, this paper introduces a simple metal cation&#8208;induced gelation method to prepare an electrocatalyst with PtNi alloy&#8208;NiO dual sites supported on Ti 3 C 2 T x , which simultaneously exhibits excellent UOR and HER performance. PtNi&#8208;NiO x /Ti 3 C 2 T x demonstrates good catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction, requiring only 1.364 V (overpotential of 0.994 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in UOR, and also exhibits remarkable catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, with PtNi&#8208;NiO x /Ti 3 C 2 T x achieving a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in HER with only 24 mV of overpotential. In the UOR//HER two&#8208;electrode electrolysis cell, it requires only 1.361 and 1.538 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the dual active sites can intelligently adsorb the electron&#8208;donating/electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activate chemical bonds, and thereby initiate urea decomposition.</description>

                Abstract The construction of efficient and durable multifunctional electrodes for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production presents a main challenge. Herein, molybdenum&#8208;modulated phosphorus&#8208;based catalytic electrodes (Mo&#8208;NiP@NF) are prepared via mild electroless plating. Heteroatoms doping or heterostructures construction can reconfigure the intrinsic electronic structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst and optimizes the key intermediates adsorption. Moreover, the (hypo/meta&#8208;)phosphite anions (PO x &#948;&#8722; ) and molybdate ions (MoO x &#948;&#8722; ) on the electrode surface of Mo&#8208;NiP@NF afford resistance to chloride (Cl &#8722; ) corrosion. Mo&#8208;NiP@NF exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 278/550 and 282/590 mV at 1 A cm &#8722;2 during the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in alkaline simulated and real seawater, respectively, whereas catalytic overall seawater splitting (OWS) reach 1 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.96 and 1.97 V cell . Remarkably, Mo&#8208;NiP@NF maintains stable operation for 1500 h in OWS. The scalability of Mo&#8208;NiP@NF allowing the assembly of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer powered by photovoltaic energy, simulating a portable hydrogen&#8208;oxygen respirator provides an oxygen/hydrogen flows of 160/320 mL min &#8722;1 . Expanding further, the trace ruthenium&#8208;loaded Mo&#8208;NiP@NF catalyst sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ) hydrolysis achieving a hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 11049.2 mL min &#8722;1 g &#8722;1 . This work provides strategic innovations and optimization solutions for the economical and mild construction of multi&#8208;scenario durable green energy conversion materials at industrial&#8208;scale application.</description>

                The deprived electrochemical kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is the prime bottleneck and remains the major obstacle in the water electrolysis processes. Herein, a facile hydrothermal technique was implemented to form a freestanding polyhedron-like Co3O4 on the microporous architecture of Ni foam, its reaction kinetics enhanced through sulfide counterpart transformation in the presence of Na2S, and their catalytic OER performances comparatively investigated in 1 M KOH medium. The formed Co3S4 catalyst shows outstanding catalytic OER activity at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 by achieving a relatively low overpotential of 292 mV compared to the pure Co3O4 catalyst and the commercial IrO2 catalyst. This enhancement results from the improved active centers and conductivity, which boost the intrinsic reaction kinetics. Further, the optimized Co3S4 catalyst exhibits admirable prolonged durability up to 72 h at varied current rates with insignificant selectivity decay. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Raman spectra measured after the prolonged OER stability test reveal a partial transformation of the active catalyst into an oxyhydroxide phase (i.e., CoOOH@Co3S4), which acts as an active catalyst phase during the electrolysis process.</description>

                The construction of supported Ir-based catalysts can effectively reduce the amount of Ir and generate a synergistic effect that enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability, making it one of the effective solutions for optimizing acidic OER catalysts. However, most reported metal oxide supports suffer from poor acid resistance and low electrical conductivity, which are critical for the OER process. Herein, we synthesized a nanosheet-like defected 1T phase-rich MoBxS2&#8211;x via a molten salt calcination process, during which the 1T phase was formed, and B was intercalated into MoS2 to protect the 1T phase structure during annealing procedure. After the wet refluxing process, IrOx clusters were uniformly deposited on the surface of MoBxS2&#8211;x to form IrOx@MoBxS2&#8211;x, which exhibited an overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with an Ir loading amount of 25.8 wt %. By comparing the OER performance of IrOx@MoBxS2&#8211;x, IrOx@MoS2(Calcinated), and IrOx@MoS2, it is demonstrated that calcination and B intercalation of MoS2 can significantly increase acidic OER performance. This work digs into the application of 1T-MoS2 as an OER catalyst support, providing strategies for the phase and morphology control of 1T-MoS2.</description>

                Preparing cost-effective and highly active catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is crucial for developing hydrogen-based technologies. Hence, four conductive polyanilines, prepared by the environmentally-friendly approach using Fe3O4 nanoparticles/H2O2 as the catalyst/main oxidant system (PANI/Fe3O4), were investi&#172;gated for the first time as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media (0.1 M H2SO4) by using voltammetry and chronoamperometry. PANI/Fe3O4 electrodes exhibited Tafel slope values in the -171 to -246 mV dec-1 range depending on the synthesis conditions &#8210; Fe3O4/aniline mass ratio and polymerization time. The sample PANI/Fe3O4-II(3) prepared with shorter reaction time and higher Fe3O4/aniline mass ratio showed the best electrocatalytic behaviour reflected in the lowest onset potential (-0.286 V), the lowest overpotential to reach a current density of -10 mA cm-2, the highest current density, the lowest HER activation energy (10 kJ mol-1), and the lowest charge-transfer resistance (5.3 &#937;) under HER conditions. Materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photo&#172;electron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and differences in their electrocatalytic HER performance were explained by differences in their content of Fe3O4, surface and electrical properties. Moreover, the possibility of using PANI/Fe3O4-II(3) as HER electrocatalyst in a wider range of pH (i.e. in alkaline media as well) and as a bifunc&#172;tional electrocatalyst, i.e., for oxygen evolution reaction beside HER, was also examined.</description>

      <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202417987</link>

                Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO), fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.87 kWh Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50 kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Reaction through the Improved Mass Transfer and Charge Transfer by Bimetal Nodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c11560</link>
      <description>Zhihui Li, Xinyu Zhang, Yiran Teng, Hanming Zhang, Tongguang Xu, Fei Teng, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403955258

                The high cost of hydrogen production by water electrolysis severely challenges its commercial application. It is highly desirable to develop efficient electrocatalysts and innovative electrolytic cells. Introducing additional metal nodes to form bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is a simple, feasible strategy to overcome the poor electrocatalytic performance of single-metal MOF. In this study, the hydrothermal method is used to synthesize bimetallic NixCoy-BTC. It is found that for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ni0.8Co0.2-BTC merely requires a potential of &#8722;0.203 V (vs reverse hydrogen electrode, RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which is significantly lower than that of Ni-BTC (&#8722;0.341 V vs RHE). Notably, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis indicate that NixCoy-BTC has improved charge transfer and mass transfer process, compared with Ni-BTC. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirms that Ni0.8Co0.2-BTC has more unpaired electrons than Ni-BTC. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that compared with Ni-BTC, NixCoy-BTC is more thermodynamically favorable for the adsorption of H+, OH&#8211;, and H2O. It demonstrates that the change of mass transfer caused by bimetallic nodes and the delicate variation of MOF surface play an important role in the electrochemical process. Moreover, a novel electrolytic cell was developed using a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this MOR-based electrolytic cell, a current density of 50 mA cm&#8211;2 can be achieved at only a cell voltage of 1.85 V, which is lower than the 2.22 V of OER-based electrolytic cell, suggesting that 16.7% electric energy can be saved. At the same time, the Faraday efficiency (FE, 98.2%) of the MOR-based cell is higher than that (94.5%) of the OER-based cell. This research offers a promising strategy for low-cost hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency in Alkaline Water Electrolysis Using Optimized Raney Nickel Coatings on Stainless Steel Electrodes</title>

                Abstract Hydrogen, as a clean and high-energy-density fuel, holds immense promise for future energy systems. The aim of this study is to enhance the efficacy and durability of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis by optimizing Raney Nickel coatings on stainless steel electrodes. This work aims to reduce costs and improve the performance of electrolysis systems, making hydrogen production more feasible for large-scale applications. The study involved the electrodeposition of Raney Nickel on stainless steel substrates using a modified Watt&#8217;s bath. The pretreatment process included degreasing, acid pickling, and Nickel Strike coating to prepare the electrode surface. Functional coatings were applied in a solution containing NiSO4, NiCl2, H3BO3, and ZnCl2 at 50&#176;C. The obtained coating substrates were characterized both chemically and morphogically by XRF analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The performance of the electrodes was evaluated through electrochemical measurements, determining the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and overpotentials for HER and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) The optimized Raney Nickel coatings, referred to as Raney 2, demonstrated a significant improvement in both HER and OER performance compared to traditional coatings. The Raney 2 coating exhibited a threefold increase in ECSA. The accelerated aging tests showed that the Raney 2 coating outperformed Raney 1, with lower peak voltages and improved stability over time. The roughness factor of the Raney 2 electrode is higher, indicating has an extensive reactive surface area. Furthermore, the study confirmed that the incorporation of elements from the 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode, such as iron, contributed to enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for OER. These findings suggest that the modified coating process can significantly extend the operational life and efficiency of electrolysis electrodes. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of Raney Nickel coatings by incorporating a 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode during deposition, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. The resulting hybrid coating demonstrates superior electrochemical performance and durability, offering a cost-effective solution for improving alkaline water electrolysis systems. This advancement can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient hydrogen production technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Annealing Temperature on the OER Activity of NiO(111) Nanosheets Prepared via Microwave and Solvothermal Synthesis Approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c14277</link>

                Earth-abundant transition metal oxides are promising alternatives to precious metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and are intensively investigated for alkaline water electrolysis. OER electrocatalysis, like most other catalytic reactions, is surface-initiated, and the catalyst performance is fundamentally determined by the surface properties. Most transition metal oxide catalysts show OER activities that depend on the predominantly exposed crystal facets/surface structure. Therefore, the design of synthetic strategies to obtain the most active crystal facets is of significant research interest. In this work, rock salt NiO OER catalysts with (111) predominantly exposed facets were synthesized by a solvothermal (ST) method either heated under supercritical or microwave-assisted (MW) conditions. Particular emphasis was placed on the influence of the post annealing temperature on the structural configuration and OER activity to compare their catalytic performances. The as-prepared electrocatalysts are pure &#945;-Ni hydroxides which were converted to rock salt NiO (111) nanosheets with hexagonal pores after heat treatment at different temperatures. The OER activity of the electrodes has been evaluated in 0.1 M KOH using geometric and intrinsic current densities via normalization by the disk area and BET area, respectively. The lowest overpotential at a geometric current density of 10 mA/cm2 is found for samples pretreated by heating between 400 and 500 &#176;C with a catalyst loading of 115 &#956;g/cm2. Despite the very similar nature of the catalysts obtained from the two methods, the ST electrodes show a higher geometric and intrinsic current density for 500 &#176;C pretreatment. The MW electrodes, however, achieve an optimal geometric current density for 400 &#176;C pretreatment, while their intrinsic current density requires pretreatment over 600 &#176;C. Interestingly, pretreated electrodes show consistently higher OER activity as compared to the poorly crystalline/less ordered hydroxide as-prepared electrocatalysts. Thus, our study highlights the importance of the synthesis method and pretreatment at an optimal temperature.</description>

                We study the energy dependence of the total and diffractive neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus cross sections at very high energies. The calculation employs the QCD dipole model and the small-$x$ nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution. We show the sensitivity of the nuclear effect quantification on the nuclear setup, and predict up to $\sim 10\%$ nuclear suppression in the inclusive neutrino-oxygen scattering stemming from the nonlinear evolution. Diffractive contribution to the total scattering is small, which is only few percentage. The $\left|q\bar{q}g\right&gt;$ componnent of the $W^{\pm}$ boson is found to contribute significantly to the diffractive process, which reaches up to $\sim 40\%$ of the diffractive cross section.</description>

      <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bonded Amorphous Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with pH&#8208;Responsive Reactive Oxygen Biocatalysis for Combined Antibacterial and Anti&#8208;inflammatory Therapies in Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202407046</link>

                Abstract Diabetic wound healing is a formidable challenge, often complicated by biofilms, immune dysregulation, and hindered vascularization within the wound environments. The intricate interplay of these microenvironmental factors has been a significant oversight in the evolution of therapeutic strategies. Herein, the design of an efficient and versatile oxygen&#8208;bonded amorphous transition metal dichalcogenide biocatalyst (aRuS&#8208;O r ) with pH&#8208;responsive reactive oxygen biocatalysis for combined antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapies in promoting diabetic wound healing is reported. Leveraging the incorporation of Ru&#9472;O bonds, aRuS&#8208;O r exhibits optimized adsorption/desorption behavior of oxygen intermediates, thereby enhancing both the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation activity in acidic conditions and ROS scavenging performance in neutral environments. Remarkably, aRuS&#8208;O r demonstrates exceptional bactericidal potency within infected milieus through biocatalytic ROS generation. Beyond its antimicrobial capability, post&#8208;eradication, aRuS&#8208;O r serves a dual role in mitigating oxidative stress in inflammatory wounds, providing robust cellular protection and fostering an M2&#8208;phenotype polarization of macrophages, which is pivotal for accelerating the wound repair process. The findings underscore the multifaceted efficacy of aRuS&#8208;O r , which harmoniously integrates high antibacterial action with anti&#8208;inflammatory and pro&#8208;angiogenic properties. This triad of functionalities positions aRuS&#8208;O r as a promising candidate for the comprehensive management of complex diabetic ulcers, addressing the unmet needs in the current therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating The Efficiency Of Reused Powder For Sustainable Production Of Austenitic Stainless Steel 316L By LPBF Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.59499/ep246281053</link>

                The sustainability of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) in metallic component production hinges on effective powder reusing, given the significant unsolidified feedstock residue. This study evaluates the influence of powder reuse on phase evolutions using thermodynamic simulations via Thermo-Calc software. Both virgin and five-time reused powders of austenitic steel 316L (SS316L) were examined alongside printed parts. Results indicate unavoidable Rhodonite (MnSiO3) inclusions due to its high oxidation affinity. Rapid solidification produces ferritic single crystal particles from hot spatters. Sieving inefficiencies allow smaller oxide particles to persist, increasing oxide fractions in printed parts. Scheil diagrams show that while minor oxygen does not impact solidification, increased dissolved oxygen promotes Spinel (MnCr2O4) formation and inclusion clustering, serving as potential nucleation sites for ferrite. Tensile sample analysis reveals that, despite the pinning effect of fine oxide particles, increased inclusion size in reused samples compromises tensile strength.</description>

                The effects of SEGs (&#8220;Shoot from vines&#8212;Enological&#8212;Granule&#8221;) on winemaking within the same variety are well established. However, the interaction of different SEG varieties combined with micro-oxygenation (MOX) and its subsequent evolution in the bottle has not been investigated to date. In this work, Tempranillo wines were treated with two doses of SEGs from Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon (12 and 24 g/L) and subjected to two fixed MOX doses (LOTR, 6.24 mg/L&#183;month, and HOTR, 11.91 mg/L&#183;month). After that, the wines were bottled, and their chemical composition and sensory profile were analysed after 3 and 6 months. Although no clear trend directly associated with the use of MOX was observed, in terms of chemical composition, wines showed an evolution in their chemical profile over time, with compounds such as vanillin increasing as more oxygen was added. Regarding their sensorial profile, the wines were more rounded after 6 months that in bottling, where SEGs or toasted descriptors, studied at the taste phase, were slightly more intense with the low SEG dose and HOTR combination.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive theoretical study of the effects of facet, oxygen vacancies, and surface strain on iron and cobalt impurities in different surfaces of anatase TiO2</title>

                Abstract We report the results of systematic ab initio modelling of various configurations of iron and cobalt impurities embedded in the (110), (101), and (100) surfaces of anatase TiO 2 , with and without oxygen vacancies. The simulation results demonstrate that incorporation into interstitial voids at the surface level is significantly more favourable than other configurations for both iron and cobalt. The calculations also demonstrate the crucial effect of the facet as well as the lesser effects of other factors, such as vacancies and strain on the energetics of defect incorporation, magnetic moment, bandgap, and catalytic performance. It is further shown that there is no tendency towards the segregation or clustering of impurities on the surface. The calculated free energies of the hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media predict that iron impurities embedded in the (101) surface of anatase TiO 2 can be a competitive catalyst for this reaction.</description>

      <title>Promiscuous and unbiased recombination underlies the sequence-discrete species of the SAR11 lineage in the deep ocean</title>

                Surveys of microbial communities (metagenomics) or isolate genomes have revealed sequence-discrete species. That is, members of the same species usually show &gt;95% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) of shared genes among themselves vs. &lt;83% ANI to members of other species while genome pairs showing between 83-95% ANI are comparatively rare. In these surveys, aquatic bacteria of the ubiquitous SAR11 clade (Class Alphaproteobacteria), which play a major role in carbon cycling, are an outlier and often do not exhibit discrete species boundaries, suggesting the potential for alternate modes of genetic differentiation. To explore evolution in SAR11, we analyzed high-quality, single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) and companion metagenomes from an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, where the SAR11 make up ~20% of the total microbial community. Our results show that SAR11 do form several sequence-discrete species, but their ANI range of discreteness is shifted to lower identities between 86-91%, with intra-species ANI ranging between 91-100%. Measuring recent gene exchange among these genomes based on a newly developed methodology revealed higher frequency of homologous recombination within compared to between species that affects sequence evolution at least twice as much as diversifying point mutation across the genome. Recombination in SAR-11 appears to be more promiscuous compared to other prokaryotic species and has facilitated the spreading of adaptive mutations within the species, further promoting the high intra-species diversity observed. These results implicate rampant, genome-wide homologous recombination as the mechanism that underlies the evolution of SAR11 into discrete species.</description>

      <title>In-situ FTIR spectroscopy of epoxy resin degradation: kinetics and mechanisms</title>

                We report on an in situ FTIR study of the thermo-oxidative degradation of a flexible epoxy resin. Different and complementary approaches to the analysis of the spectral data were employed, providing a detailed description of the process in terms of kinetics and mechanisms. A preliminary normal coordinate analysis, based on the DFT method, allowed for a reliable interpretation of the observed spectrum, increasing the amount of available structural information. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy provided details on the evolution of the reacting network structure. The relative stability of the various functional groups was ranked, and the most likely sites of initiation were identified. Oxygen fixation on the network chains produced amide and ketone groups, with the latter developing at a higher rate. The kinetic profiles of various functional groups were accurately simulated by a first-order, biexponential model, which allowed a quantitative comparison among their relative stabilities. The spectroscopic analysis allowed us to propose likely mechanisms and to identify those that occur preferentially.</description>

      <title>Backtracking Metabolic Dynamics in Single Cells Predicts Bacterial Replication in Human Macrophages</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.28.620606</link>

                Accurately tracking dynamic state transitions is crucial for modeling and predicting biological outcomes, as it captures heterogeneity of cellular responses. To build a model to predict bacterial infection in single cells, we have monitored in parallel infection progression and metabolic parameters in thousands of human primary macrophages infected with the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila. By combining live-cell imaging with a novel tool for classifying cells based on infection outcomes, we were able to trace the specific evolution of metabolic parameters linked to distinct outcomes, such as bacterial replication or cell death. Our findings revealed that early changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (&#916;&#968;m) and in the production of mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (mROS) are associated with macrophages that will later support bacterial growth. We used these data to train an explainable machine-learning model and achieved 83% accuracy in predicting L. pneumophila replication in single, infected cells before bacterial replication starts. Our results highlight backtracking as a valuable tool to gain new insights in host-pathogen interactions and identify early mitochondrial alterations as key predictive markers of success of bacterial infection.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of sulfuric acid speleogenesis in the Mulapampa travertine, Central Andes of Peru: evidence from the Gruta con Lago</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5038/1827-806x.53.2.2503</link>
      <description>Andrzej Tyc, Krzysztof Gaidzik, Justyna Ciesielczuk, Katarzyna W&#261;tor, International Journal of Speleology. 53(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403866293

                Sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) is a form of hypogene speleogenesis characterized by the formation of caves in carbonate rocks due to the presence of sulfuric acid. This study focuses on the Gruta con Lago, one of three caves identified in the Mulapampa travertine, located in the central Andes of Peru. These caves are accessed through collapse sinkholes, and much of their morphology results from roof breakdown. The bottom of the studied cave is situated at the current water table. Despite the absence of typical solutional features associated with SAS caves, mineralogical and geochemical evidence of speleogenesis involving H2SO4 has been found in Gruta con Lago. Significant accumulations of gypsum deposits on the cave floor and replacement gypsum crusts on walls &#8211; both considered by-products of SAS &#8211; are present. Cave gypsum samples exhibit negative sulfur isotopic composition (ranging from -19.4 to -8.2&#8240;) and oxygen (ranging from -9.0 to -1.3&#8240;), which are indicative of sulfide (H2S) oxidation. This article discusses potential scenarios of SAS events in the evolution of hypogene karst in the Mulapampa travertine. It also considers the significance of the proximity of the active volcanoes of the Ampato-Sabancaya Volcanic Complex (ASVC) and seismogenic crustal faults in the formation of a thick travertine cover and the potential for SAS processes.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-024-01542-x</link>

                Abstract Wastewater electrolysis cells (WECs) for decentralized wastewater treatment/reuse coupled with H 2 production can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation of water, waste, and energy carrier. This study reports Ir-doped NiFe 2 O 4 (NFI, ~ 5 at% Ir) spinel layer with TiO 2 overlayer (NFI/TiO 2 ), as a scalable heterojunction anode for direct electrolysis of wastewater with circumneutral pH in a single-compartment cell. In dilute (0.1 M) NaCl solutions, the NFI/TiO 2 marks superior activity and selectivity for chlorine evolution reaction, outperforming the benchmark IrO 2 . Robust operation in near-neutral pH was confirmed. Electroanalyses including operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy unveiled crucial roles of TiO 2 which serves both as the primary site for Cl &#8722; chemisorption and a protective layer for NFI as an ohmic contact. Galvanostatic electrolysis of NH 4 + -laden synthetic wastewater demonstrated that NFI/TiO 2 not only achieves quasi-stoichiometric NH 4 + -to-N 2 conversion, but also enhances H 2 generation efficiency with minimal competing reactions such as reduction of dissolved oxygen and reactive chlorine. The scaled-up WEC with NFI/TiO 2 was demonstrated for electrolysis of toilet wastewater.</description>

      <title>Cyclic electron flow and Photosystem II-less photosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/fp24185</link>
      <description>Maria Ermakova, Duncan Fitzpatrick, Anthony W. D. Larkum, Functional Plant Biology. 51(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403854203

                Oxygenic photosynthesis is characterised by the cooperation of two photo-driven complexes, Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), sequentially linked through a series of redox-coupled intermediates. Divergent evolution has resulted in photosystems exhibiting complementary redox potentials, spanning the range necessary to oxidise water and reduce CO2 within a single system. Catalysing nature&#8217;s most oxidising reaction to extract electrons from water is a highly specialised task that limits PSII&#8217;s metabolic function. In contrast, potential electron donors in PSI span a range of redox potentials, enabling it to accept electrons from various metabolic processes. This metabolic flexibility of PSI underpins the capacity of photosynthetic organisms to balance energy supply with metabolic demands, which is key for adaptation to environmental changes. Here, we review the phenomenon of &#8216;PSII-less photosynthesis&#8217; where PSI functions independently of PSII by operating cyclic electron flow using electrons derived from non-photochemical reactions. PSII-less photosynthesis enables supercharged ATP production and is employed, for example, by cyanobacteria&#8217;s heterocysts to host nitrogen fixation and by bundle sheath cells of C4 plants to boost CO2 assimilation. We discuss the energetic benefits of this arrangement and the prospects of utilising it to improve the productivity and stress resilience of photosynthetic organisms.</description>

      <title>Endometriosis development in relation to hypoxia: a murine model study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-024-00973-x</link>
      <description>Marta Hoffmann, Rados&#322;aw Maksym, Katarzyna Pucia, Monika Kuciak, Andrzej Ma&#263;kiewicz, Claudine Kieda, Molecular Medicine. 30(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403891593

                Abstract Background Endometriosis, due to its ambiguous symptoms, still remains one of the most difficult female diseases to treat, with an average diagnosis time of 7&#8211;9 years. The changing level of hypoxia plays an important role in a healthy endometrium during menstruation and an elevated expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1&#945;) has been demonstrated in ectopic endometria. HIF-1&#945; mediates the induction of proangiogenic factors and the development of angiogenesis is a critical step in the establishment and pathogenesis of endometriosis. Although the inhibition of angiogenesis has been proposed as one of the actionable therapeutic modalities, vascular normalization and re-oxygenation may become a possible new approach for therapeutic intervention. Methods Our goal was to investigate whether a selected murine model of endometriosis would be suitable for future studies on new methods for treating endometriosis. Non-invasive, high-resolution ultrasound-monitored observation was selected as the preclinical approach to obtain imaging of the presence and volume of the endometriotic-like lesions. The EF5 (2-(2-Nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-N-(2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl)acetamide) compound that selectively binds to reduced proteins in hypoxic cells was used for hypoxia detection. The expression of Pten and other crucial genes linking endometriosis and hypoxia were also assessed. Results Using EF5, a pentafluorinated derivative of the 2-nitroimidazole that is metabolically reduced by oxygen-inhibitable nitroreductase, we confirmed that hypoxia did develop in the selected model and was detected in uterine and ectopic endometriotic lesions. Moreover, the changes in oxygen tension also influenced the expression level of significant genes related to endometriosis, like Pten , Trp53 , Hif1a , Epas1 , and Vegfa . Their strong modulation evidenced here is indicative of model reliability. Using high-resolution ultrasound-based imaging, we present a non-invasive method of visualization that enables the detection and observation of lesion evolution throughout the duration of the experiment, which is fundamental for further preclinical studies and treatment evaluation. Conclusions The selected model and method of visualization appear to be suitable for the study of new treatment strategies based on hypoxia alleviation and blood flow restoration.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Defect-Dependent Conductivity-Type Switching in CuFe2O4 for Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Reduction of Benzaldehyde</title>

                Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds provides a sustainable approach to upgrading biomass-derived feedstocks with reduced energy requirements. However, PEC reduction has primarily focused on hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction reactions, limited by the availability of stable photocathode materials. In this study, we demonstrate the extended PEC performance of defect-engineered CuFe2O4 films, achieving over 18 hours of stable benzaldehyde reduction to benzyl alcohol. Modulating CuFe2O4 conductivity from n-type to p-type through controlled annealing conditions enhanced its hole concentration, achieving a cathodic photocurrent density of 1.5 mA/cm2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE. Using 1,4-benzoquinone as a redox mediator in a mixed acetonitrile/water electrolyte, the PEC system produced benzyl alcohol at a rate of 2.57 &#956;mol/h with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.3% at 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgNO&#8323;. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) revealed that oxygen-rich annealing conditions improved charge transport and surface catalytic activity, resulting in a threefold increase in benzyl alcohol production rate. This PEC approach lowered the required applied potential by ~1 V compared to traditional electrocatalysis methods, offering a more energy-efficient route for carbonyl reduction. These findings underscore the potential of CuFe&#8322;O&#8324; as a viable photocathode material for sustainable organic transformations under mild reaction conditions.</description>

                Abstract Carbon materials are the promising cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion capacitors (SICs) with high energy/power density, however, clarifying the evolution processes of functional groups in carbon materials and revealing their energy storage mechanisms are full of challenges. Inspired by the ancient practice of alchemy, which sought to purify Dan medicine and remove impurities through precise control of the refining temperature, the local oxygen reconstruction strategy, to alter the functional groups species in SP 3 &#8208;C, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving targeted regulation of carbonyl groups with increase from 27.9 to 43.3 at%, which efficiently change the electronic structure of the carbon framework and realize the dual&#8208;ion adsorption of Na + and ClO 4 &#8722; , according well with the theoretical calculations. As expected, the obtained carbon cathode delivers a specific capacity of 145 mAh g &#8722;1 , higher than that of the parent carbon material (95 mAh g &#8722;1 ). Impressively, the ex situ X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and in situ Raman reveals that carbonyl can act as dual&#8208;ion active sites for Na + and ClO 4 &#8722; through pseudocapacitive behavior under different voltage states. Notably, the assembled SIC using the carbonyl&#8208;rich carbon cathode exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 162 Wh kg &#8722;1 . This work opens a novel avenue for regulating the carbonyl content of carbon materials.</description>

      <title>Coupling CoIr Nanoalloys with MXene by Lewis Acidic Molten Salt Etching for Wide&#8208;pH&#8208;Environment Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202401449</link>

                Abstract Metal/MXene&#8208;based materials show broad prospects in energy conversation through the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI). However, the difficulty and harshness of synthesis heavily limit their further application. Herein, using Lewis acidic molten salt to etch MAX as a precursor of MXene, a more convenient and safer strategy is designed to in situ construct the MXene&#8208;supported CoIr nanoalloy (CoIr/MXene) catalyst through Ti&#9472;O&#9472;M bond. The special layered structure and oxygen&#8208;containing functional group of MXene regulate the SMSI upon CoIr nanoalloys. Moreover, the contact angle and in situ Raman test results exhibit good interface hydrophilicity of MXene, enhancing the water adsorption on interfaces, and accelerating the mass transfer process. As a result, CoIr/MXene shows high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, which only needs overpotentials of 34 and 50 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline and acidic media, respectively, with excellent stability. Especially, in alkaline media, CoIr/MXene possesses 6 times higher HER mass activity (4.297 A mg Ir &#8722;1 ) than commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.686 A mg Pt &#8722;1 ) at the potential of 50 mV, indicating larger active site density and intrinsic activity for CoIr/MXene. This work expands the application of the molten salt assist etching strategy and provides new insight for the development of metal/MXene&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Structure-Driven Performance Enhancement in Palladium&#8211;Graphene Oxide Catalysts for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17215296</link>
      <description>Krishnamoorthy Sathiyan, Chang Gao, Toru Wada, Poulami Mukherjee, Kalaivani Seenivasan, Toshiaki Taniike, Materials. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403943964

                Graphene oxide (GO) has recently gained significant attention in electrocatalysis as a promising electrode material owing to its unique physiochemical properties such as enhanced electron transfers due to a conjugated &#960;-electron system, high surface area, and stable support for loading electroactive species, including metal nanoparticles. However, only a few studies have been directed toward the structural characteristics of GO, elaborating on the roles of oxygen-containing functional groups, the presence of defects, interlayer spacing between the layered structure, and nonuniformity in the carbon skeleton along with their influence on electrochemical performance. In this work, we aim to understand these properties in various GO materials derived from different graphitic sources. Both physiochemical and electrochemical characterization were employed to correlate the above-mentioned features and explore the effect of the location of the palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) on various GO supports for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The interaction of the functional groups has a crucial role in the Pd dispersion and its electrochemical performance. Among the different GO samples, Pd supported on GO derived from graphene nanoplate (GNP), Pd/GO-GNP, exhibits superior HER performance; this could be attributed to the optimal balance among particle size, defect density, less in-plane functionalities, and higher electrochemical surface area. This study, thus, helps to identify the optimal conditions that lead to the best performance of Pd-loaded GO, contributing to the design of more effective HER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>An advanced approach for definition of the "Milky Way

                Our Galaxy - the Milky Way - has certain features of the structure and evolution. The morphological, photometric, kinematic, and chemodynamical properties are usually considered in the search for the Milky Way galaxies-analogues (MWAs). The discovery of MWA galaxies with a larger number of simultaneous selection parameters and more stringent constraints on a given parameter yields a sample of MWA galaxies with properties closer to the true properties of the Milky Way. So, in general, such MW parameters as the morphological type, luminosity, color indices, structural parameters (size, bar, bulge, thin and thick disks, inner ring, halo), bulge to total ratio, stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and rotation velocity were used in various combinations for comparison with other galaxies. However, the offset of some MW features in the multiparameter space of MWAs features should be significant. The paper aims to give a brief overview of the problematics and to present our approach for studying Milky Way and MWAs matching characteristics (this project is supported by the National Research Fund of Ukraine). We propose to enlarge as much as possible the number of Milky Way features and compile various samples of MWAs in our comoving cosmological volume for their further optimization. Such features can include 3Dkinematics of star's movement in certain regions, low oxygen content on the periphery, low nuclear activity, and the lack of significant merging over the past 10 Gyrs (isolation criterion). This approach will make it possible to widely formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the detection of MWA galaxies as well as to reveal other MW multiwavelength features.</description>

      <title>Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age
  determinations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.14014</link>

                Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.</description>

                Summary Populations of Polypogon fugax have developed resistance to many acetyl&#8208;CoA carboxylase (ACCase)&#8208;inhibiting herbicides. This resistance threats the effectiveness and sustainability of herbicide use. In our previous research, a field P. fugax population exhibited GST&#8208;based metabolic resistance to the widely used ACCase&#8208;inhibiting herbicide quizalofop&#8208;p&#8208;ethyl. Here, in this current study, we identified and characterized two GST genes (named as PfGSTF2 and PfGSTF58 ) that showed higher expression levels in the resistant than the susceptible population. Transgenic rice calli overexpressing PfGSTF2 , but not PfGSTF58 , became resistant to quizalofop&#8208;p&#8208;ethyl and haloxyfop&#8208;R&#8208;methyl. This reflects similar cross&#8208;resistance pattern to what was observed in the resistant P. fugax population. Transgenic rice seedlings overexpressing PfGSTF2 also exhibited resistance to quizalofop&#8208;p&#8208;ethyl. In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the orthologue gene in rice seedlings increased their sensitivity to quizalofop&#8208;p&#8208;ethyl. LC&#8211;MS analysis of in vitro herbicide metabolism by Escherichia coli &#8208;expressed recombinant PfGSTF2 revealed that quizalofop (but not haloxyfop) was detoxified at the ether bond, generating the GSH&#8208;quizalofop conjugate and a propanoic acid derivative with greatly reduced herbicidal activity. Equally, these two metabolites accumulated at higher levels in the resistant population than the susceptible population. In addition, both recombinant PfGSTF2 and PfGSTF58 can attenuate cytotoxicity by reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting a role in plant defence against ROS generated by herbicides. Furthermore, the GST inhibitor (NBD&#8208;Cl) reversed resistance in the resistant population, and PfGSTF2 (but not PfGSTF58) responded to NBD&#8208;Cl inhibition. All these suggest that PfGSTF2 plays a significant role in the evolution of quizalofop resistance through enhanced herbicide metabolism in P. fugax .</description>

                We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z=4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* = 1.4$\times$10^{10} M$_\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\beta$ luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of gravitational collapse in the accreting neutron stars of
  binary-driven hypernovae</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.05767</link>
      <description>L. M. Becerra, Federico Cipolletta, C. L. Fryer, D&#233;bora P. Menezes, Constan&#231;a Provid&#234;ncia, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403882973

                The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, $t_{\rm col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_{\rm col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS-BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary Expressions of the Early Jurassic Jenkyns Event in an Inland Lacustrine System in the Yin'gen&#8211;Ejinaqi Basin, North China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.15186</link>
      <description>Bing Yang, Guozhen Xu, Gangying Hui, Yi Wei, Xinzhi ZHANG, Jinjun Yi, Siyuan Sun, S. Zhang, Acta Geologica Sinica - English Edition. 98(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403881655

                Abstract The Jenkyns Event, more widely known as the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T&#8208;OAE), is marked by globally distributed negative carbon&#8208;isotope excursions, widespread oxygen depletion, and large&#8208;scale organic carbon burial, which indicate major climate/environmental perturbations in Earth's surface systems during the Early Jurassic. Although extensive research has been conducted in European continental settings, particularly in the western peri&#8208;Tethys regions, the impacts of this event beyond Europe remains largely unexplored. Here, a multiapproach study including investigations into the spore&#8208;pollen assemblages, pyrite framboids, clay minerals, total organic carbon (TOC) levels, and organic carbon isotope ( &#948; 13 C org ) levels in a lacustrine borehole section (MED1) from the Yin'gen&#8211;Ejinaqi Basin, North China, provides evidence of the occurrence of the Jenkyns Event and its extensive sedimentary responses in the eastern Tethys terrestrial systems. Two distinct spore&#8208;pollen assemblages have been identified in MED1 (drilling depth: 982.4 m to 1267.5 m), with the Cycadopites &#8211; Protopinu s&#8211; Osmundacidites assemblage in the lower part (1267.5 m to 1132.9 m) indicating a middle Early Jurassic age and the Classopollis assemblage in the upper part (1132.9 m to 985.7 m) suggesting a Toarcian age. Framboidal pyrite data suggest more anoxic conditions during the deposition of black mudstone and shale intercalations in the lower part of the Classopollis assemblage (1132.9 m to 1066.9 m), which combined with organic carbon enrichment and negative &#948; 13 C org excursions, are considered the paleoenvironmental response to the Jenkyns Event in the study area. Furthermore, the evolution of vegetation groups changed from plant groups characterized by bisaccate and cycad pollen, as well as fern spores, to vegetation groups represented by Cheirolepidiaceae pollen across the Jenkyns Event, as evidenced by spore&#8208;pollen data, together with the clay mineral assemblage change characterized by a notable increase in illite at the expense of kaolinite, suggests that while a subtropical&#8208;temperate climate persisted, a change toward warmer and drier conditions most likely occurred in the early Toarcian in the study area. In contrast to the humidification evidenced in many coastal settings, this aridification trend in the Yin'gen&#8211;Ejinaqi Basin aligns with the conditions in many inland areas. It is hypothesized that the underlying cause of these divergent changes may be linked to certain patterns of spatially variable water availability on land, potentially driven by extremified hydrological conditions.</description>

                Relevance. In Kuzbass, a coalbed methane production project is being implemented for the first time in Russia. Formation water extracted together with coalbed methane plays an important role, since it has been in contact with the coal-bearing rocks for a long time, therefore it contains rich geochemical information. Over the period 2002&#8211;2022, new isotopic data were accumulated both on the waters of the region coal deposits and on overlying waters, including surface waters. Aim. Based on the material accumulated on the isotopic composition (&#948;D, &#948;18O, &#948;13C, 34S, 3H, 14C) of natural waters in coal-bearing areas, create an evolutionary scheme for the formation of waters within the framework of the developed hypothesis on the interaction of water-rock-coal-methane. Objects. River, underground waters of the zone of active water exchange, upper and lower parts of the zone of slow water exchange (extracted together with coalbed methane). Methods. Studies of the isotopic composition of waters were carried out in several laboratories: in the Multielement and Isotope Research Center of the SB RAS, the Technical Branch of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise &#8220;SNIIGGIMS&#8221;, in the radiocarbon AMS laboratory based on the Center for Collective Use &#8220;Cenozoic Geochronology&#8221; and in the Pacific Oceanological Institute Far Eastern Branch Russian Academy of Sciences (POI) FEB RAS. Results and conclusions. The paper introduces the data on &#948;D, &#948;18&#1054;, &#948;13&#1057; &#1080; &#948;34S for surface and groundwater in Kuzbass in coalbed methane production areas. It is shown that all the waters under consideration are infiltration based on their isotopic composition (&#948;D and &#948;18&#1054;). The waters of the lower part of the slow water exchange, produced together with coalbed methane, are characterized by a positive oxygen shift and very light hydrogen. A diagram of the evolution of the isotopic composition of water-dissolved carbon in the region has been compiled according to the data obtained. It is noted that the atmospheric source of CO2 is characteristic only of river waters, and only biogenic carbon dioxide is present in groundwater. The wide range of &#948;13&#1057;DIC values of the latter is explained by the varying degrees of participation of light soil carbon dioxide and heavy biochemical carbon dioxide formed during methane formation in the coal seam. The heaviest values are typical for waters produced together with coalbed methane, which is associated with long-term interaction with coal and methane. The time of such interaction was determined using the radiocarbon method: 17&#8211;30 thousand years. In areas where coalbed methane is produced, an increase in &#948;13&#1057;DIC values for all natural waters is observed, which requires further study.</description>

                Abstract Background Metabolic syndrome (MS) has been associated with the development of myocardial dysfunction which can lead to heart failure (HF). It is possible to detect early signs of myocardial dysfunction by assessing the global longitudinal strain (GLS) in a transthoracic echocardiography. A reduced GLS is considered as a predictor of HF development. Preventive strategies are recommended in patients with MS to avoid the progression to HF. Although exercise improves cardiovascular and metabolic health in MS patients, it is unknown whether exercise can affect the evolution of GLS in a group of patients with MS who are under medical treatment. Purpose To assess the prevalence of myocardial dysfunction (i.e., reduced GLS) in a heterogeneous group of patients with MS who are under medical treatment, and to test in these patients if 16 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve the GLS. Methods Seventy-seven volunteers with MS and without signs or symptoms of HF were randomized in one of two 16-week intervention: i). HIIT in stationary bikes 3 sessions/week, 50 minutes/session + medical treatment (HIIT group), or ii). medical treatment (CONTROL). Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), and GLS together with rutinary echocardiographic parameters were assessed before and after intervention. The effect of HIIT compared to CONTROL was analyzed by a split-plot ANOVA to compare the effects of time (pre vs. post) and group (HIIT vs. CONTROL), and the interaction between the two factors. Results Before intervention 48.9% of participants from the HIIT group, and 46.7% from the CON group had a reduced GLS (i.e., &amp;gt;17% for men and &amp;gt;18% for women). However, none of them had a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), signs of diastolic dysfunction or an abnormal VO2max (less than 80% of predicted VO2max). After the 16-week intervention, only individuals from the HIIT group improved their VO2max (time*group P&amp;lt;0.001). LVEF did not improve in any of the experimental groups (time P=0.278) HIIT group improved their GLS by 0.51%, whereas CONTROL group improved it by 0.05% without reaching statistical significance (time*group P=0.186). However, a subgroup analysis of GLS conducted among the participants from the HIIT group discriminated by their pre-intervention values (GLS normal or reduced), showed that individuals with reduced GLS improved significantly by 1,41% (P=0.001) whereas those with a normal GLS improved by 0.14% without reaching statistical significance (P=0.736, time*group P=0.009). Conclusions Myocardial dysfunction assessed by GLS is present in MS even in the absence of symptoms, diastolic dysfunction, or reductions in the LVEF. HIIT can reduce the risk of HF development by improving GLS in patients with MS and early signs of myocardial dysfunction.A. Overall changes in GLSB.

      <title>Variability of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in a coastal peatland rewetted with brackish water from the Baltic Sea derived from autonomous high-resolution measurements</title>

                Abstract. Rewetting peatlands is an important measure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land use change. After rewetting, the areas can be highly heterogeneous in terms of GHG exchange and depend on water level, vegetation, previous use, and duration of rewetting. Here, we present a study of a coastal peatland that was rewetted by brackish water from the Baltic Sea and thus became part of the coastal shallow Baltic Sea water system through a permanent hydrological connection. Rewetting suppresses carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by preventing aerobic decomposition of organic matter. Conversely, the anoxic conditions in the soil lead to an increase in methane (CH4) emissions, which counteracts CO2 mitigation effects. Unlike to rewetting with freshwater, the effects of rewetting with brackish, sulfate-containing water are less studied, although positive effects are expected as sulfate-reducing bacteria may become established and might out-compete methane-producing archaea (methanogens) for substrates, resulting in lower CH4 emissions. Both aspects, environmental heterogeneity and the brackish water column formation, require improved quantification techniques to assess local sinks and sources of atmospheric GHGs. We conducted nine weeks of autonomous and high-resolution, sensor-based bottom water measurements of marine physical and chemical variables at two locations in a permanently flooded peatland in summer 2021, and derived GHG fluxes. Results show considerable temporal fluctuations of CO2 and CH4, expressed as multi-day, diurnal and event-based variability and spatial differences for variables dominantly influenced by biological processes. The multi-day variability resulted in a pronounced magnitude of measured GHG partial pressures during the deployment ranging between 295.0&#8211;8937.8 &#181;atm (CO2) and 22.8&#8211;2681.3 &#181;atm (correspond to 42.7&#8211;3568.6 nmol L&#8722;1; CH4), respectively. In addition, the variability of the GHGs, temperature, and oxygen was characterized by pronounced diurnal cycles, resulting e.g., in a mean daily variability of 4066.9 &#181;atm for CO2 and 1769.6 &#181;atm for CH4. The diurnal variability led to a pronounced discrepancy between the measurements during the day and at night as well as depending on the location, resulting in CO2 and CH4 fluxes that varied by a factor of 2.1&#8211;2.3 and 2.3&#8211;3.0, respectively. The rewetted peatland was further impacted by fast system changes (events) such as storm, precipitation and major water level changes, which impacted biogeochemical cycling and GHG partial pressures. The derived average GHG exchange amounted to 0.12 &#177; 0.16 g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (CO2) and 0.51 &#177; 0.56 mg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (CH4), respectively. These fluxes are high (CO2) to low (CH4) compared to studies from temperate peatlands rewetted with freshwater. Comparing these fluxes with the previous year (i.e., results from a reference study), the fluxes decreased by a factor of 1.9 and 2.6, respectively. This was potentially due to a progressive consumption of organic material, a suppression of CH4 production, and aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of CH4, indicating a positive evolution of the rewetted peatland into a site with moderate GHG emissions within the next years.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Tuning electrolyte properties is a widely recognized strategy to enhance activity and selectivity in electrocatalysis, drawing increasing attention in this domain. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, debates persist about how various electrolyte components influence electrocatalytic reactions. We offer a concise review focusing on current discussions, especially the contentious roles of cations. This article further examines how different factors affect the interfacial solvent structure, particularly the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and delves into the microscopic kinetics of electron and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. We also discuss the overarching influence of solvents from a kinetic modeling perspective, aiming to develop a robust correlation between electrolyte structure and reactivity. Lastly, we summarize ongoing research challenges and suggest potential directions for future studies on electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis. Key Scientists In 1956, Marcus theory was developed to describe the mechanism of outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OS&#8208;ET). In 1992, Nocera et al. directly measured proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics for the first time, and their subsequent research in 1995 investigated the effects of proton motion on electron transfer (ET) kinetics. In 1999 and 2000, Hammes&#8208;schiffer et al. developed the multistate continuum theory for multiple charge reactions and deduced the rate expressions for nonadiabatic PCET reactions in solution, laying the theoretical foundation for the analysis of PCET kinetics in electrochemical processes. In 2006, Saveant et al. verified the concerted proton and electron transfer (CPET) mechanism in the oxidation of phenols coupled with intramolecular amine&#8208;driven proton transfer (PT). Their subsequent work in 2008 reported the pH&#8208;dependent pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenols. Electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have gained emphasis in recent years. In 2009, Markovic's pioneering work proposed non&#8208;covalent interactions between hydrated alkaline cations and adsorbed OH species in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In 2011, Markovic et al. significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline solution by improving water dissociation, which was assumed to dominate the sluggish HER kinetics in such media. In comparation, Yan et al. applied hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory in 2015 to explain the pH&#8208;dependent HER/HOR activity. Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). In 2016 and 2017, Karen Chan et al. introduced the electric field generated by solvated cations to explain the cation effects on electrochemical CO2RR. Conversely, in 2021, Koper et al. suggested that short&#8208;range electrostatic interactions between partially desolvated metal cations and CO 2 stabilized CO 2 and promoted CO 2 RR. Recent researches have combined the exploration of the electrical double layer (EDL) structure with theoretical analysis of PCET kinetics. In 2019, Huang et al. developed a microscopic Hamiltonian model to quantitatively understand the sluggish hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In 2021, two meticulous studies from Shao&#8208;Horn's group analyzed the effects of cations on reorganization energy and the impacts of hydrogen bonds between proton donors and acceptors on proton tunneling kinetics, respectively. Electrolyte effects on proton transport process were researched in recent years. In 2022, Hu et al. and Chen et al. proposed that the cation&#8208;induced electric field distribution and pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonding network connectivity played essential roles in proton transport, separately.</description>

      <title>Oxygen uptake slow component: Enigma of the &#8216;excess&#8217; oxygen used during heavy and severe exercise</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1113/ep092326</link>
      <description>David C. Poole, Glenn A. Gaesser, Experimental Physiology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403826044

                In the 1980s, foundational physiology and exercise physiology texts considered that oxygen uptake ( V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ ) increased as a linear function of work rate (WR) on the cycle ergometer. Whereas this was true up to the maximum V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ ( V &#775; O 2 max ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{max}}}}$ ) for incremental exercise where WR was increased by 25 W or so per minute, for constant WR heavy- (i.e., &gt;lactate threshold, LT) or severe- (&gt;critical power, CP) intensity exercise there was an 'excess' V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ that manifested after the fast kinetics associated with the WR transition (Gaesser &amp; Poole, 1996). This excess V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ became evident only after 2&#8211;3 min and for heavy exercise stabilized within 10 or so minutes or, for severe exercise, projected V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ to V &#775; O 2 max ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{max}}}}$ auguring exhaustion shortly thereafter. In the extreme, this V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ slow component ( V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ ) can amount to 1&#8211;1.5 L O2/min, eroding muscle efficiency. For physiologists seeking to better understand muscle energetics and exercise limitations, non-linear behaviour often provides powerful insights into systems control. However, at the time, explanations for the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ were less than satisfying. Typically, researchers in the field had extrapolated the estimated O2 cost of an array of physiological processes to calculate their putative role in the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ during heavy/severe intensity exercise (Gaesser &amp; Poole, 1996). Alternatively, the temporal correlation of these processes with the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ was assessed to try and establish cause and effect. Principal processes considered included increasing ventilation, body temperature, blood lactate and catecholamines. Neither approach was especially satisfying; the former could explain far more than 100% of the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ (!), and the latter could not discriminate causal from casual. What was needed was a technique that had the power to parse among candidate variables. The initial strategy was to independently measure leg muscle(s) V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ simultaneously with pulmonary V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ during heavy/severe intensity exercise. This procedure unequivocally identified the exercising muscles as the source of the majority (&gt;80%) of the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ , thereby discounting a major role for ventilation, body temperature, auxiliary muscles and circulating factors such as lactate and catecholamines that might raise the metabolic rate outside the exercising muscles (Poole, 1994). Based upon subsequent a priori investigations, lactate and catecholamines as well as temperature increases acting within the exercising muscles were also discounted in this regard (Gaesser &amp; Poole, 1996). Viable remaining candidates relating to the altered physicochemical milieu associated with heavy/severe intensity exercise included fatiguing muscle fibres, recruitment of additional, more fast-twitch, and less efficient muscle fibres, decreased mitochondrial P:O (i.e., ATP:O2) ratio and less efficient chemical&#8211;mechanical coupling. To date, most of these remain possibilities, though decreased P:O ratio &#8211; high O2 cost of phosphate production &#8211; seems unlikely (Rossiter et al., 2002) and, in dog and human muscles, the recruitment of additional muscle fibres is not requisite for a V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ effect (e.g., Zoladz et al., 2008). However, a tacit presumption of many previous investigators pursuing the mechanistic bases for the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ was that the external power produced reflected unchanged muscular input. One commendable novelty, among several, of a study by Macdougall and colleagues (2024), in this issue of Experimental Physiology, is that they considered and measured the biomechanics of cycling and determined how it changed relative to the generation of the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ in concert with (almost) real-time determination of quadriceps muscle fatigue. Their data reveal that, although power remained constant over 20 min or so whilst the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ was developing, biomechanical indices of peak total downstroke force, minimum upstroke force and the upstroke index of effectiveness were not constant and showed a weak correlation with the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ . Importantly, the observed association between muscle fatigue and the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ was highly significant, underlining the relevance of these findings despite considerable interindividual variability in the primary measurements. Indeed, even though all subjects exercised at a well-defined power output of 10% above their individually estimated second lactate threshold, time to task failure ranged from &#8764;10 to 55 min. This is not trivial as factors affecting muscle fatigue as well as the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ undoubtedly differ when comparing fatiguing exercise among subjects with a &gt;5-fold range in time to task failure. The relatively high pedalling cadence of 80 rpm may have contributed to the large response heterogeneity as cadence has varying impacts on CP (i.e., relative to preferred cadence) (Carnevale &amp; Gaesser, 1991). The metabolic stress of exercise may have differed across subjects as a result, making it more challenging to identify a specific cause for the associated V &#775; O 2 ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ response across this substantial range in exercise duration. The road from scientific discovery to general acceptance can be fraught with hurdles. For example, Dr Barbara McClintock's identification of 'jumping genes' in maize in the 1940s and 1950s was initially disbelieved, then begrudgingly acknowledged, but dismissed as unimportant. It was only decades later, in 1983, when its fundamental relevance was appreciated and rewarded with an unopposed Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of genetic transposition. For her brilliance, tenacity, and multiple apex achievements, she became, in 2005, the only woman scientist to be lauded with her picture on a U.S. postage stamp. In like fashion, the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ has been disputed, ignored, dismissed as unimportant or inconvenient, and until relatively recently, has been underappreciated for its great potential to resolve key facets of skeletal muscle energetics during exercise. The intriguing findings of MacDougall and colleagues (2024) take us away from the Ockham's razor approach of looking for a singular driver of the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ and force acknowledgment that not only may multiple factors contribute to its evolution, but those factors likely differ considerably across individuals. Resolution of the mechanistic bases for the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ will not only enhance our fundamental understanding of muscle energetics but is also likely to have broad applications across medicine and society. For instance, if the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ can be controlled such that it does not progress the individual to V &#775; O 2 max ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{max}}}}$ , exercise tolerance can be increased. This is particularly pertinent for patients with heart failure or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis) for whom the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ forces encroachment on their low and limiting ceiling for cardiovascular or ventilatory function, respectively, crippling exercise capacity (Gaesser &amp; Poole, 1996). In contrast, with the upwards spiral of obesity in the developed world, it is conceivable that the 'luxurious' calorigenic effects of the V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ could be marshalled to enhance the efficacy of exercise to restore a better caloric balance across affected populations. Specifically, targeting exercise that produced the greatest tolerable V &#775; O 2 SC ${{\dot{V}}_{{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}{\mathrm{SC}}}}$ would expend more calories and thereby accelerate weight loss.

      <title>Are we prepared for the next pandemic: Monitor on increasing human and animal H5N1 avian influenza infection</title>

                Human infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by certain strains of avian influenza A viruses, such as H5N1 and H7N9, results in severe acute respiratory disease with a high mortality rate, among which the former is pathogenic to birds.[1] In recent years, HPAI H5 has spread globally, causing human infections. The first reported case of bovine H5N1 infection, which was subsequently transmitted to humans, garnered significant international attention. Drawing on the historical influenza pandemic experience and biological characteristics of the virus, under specific conditions, such as reassortment with human and swine influenza viruses, avian influenza viruses (AIV) may achieve efficient human-to-human transmission, potentially leading to a global pandemic. Here, we aimed to review the historical trends of H5N1 avian influenza infections in humans and the recent developments in epidemiological situations, evaluate the transmission risk of H5N1 avian influenza, and propose avian influenza control recommendations for public health decision-making. Global trends in human H5N1 infection. The avian influenza A H5N1 was first detected in southern China in 1996. In 1997, a significant outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza occurred among farmed chickens in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, marking the first reported case of H5N1 crossing the species barrier to infect humans. This initial outbreak resulted in 18 human infections and 6 fatalities. Although the outbreak was controlled at that time, H5N1 persisted in avian species. It re-emerged in 2003 and widely spread among birds across Asia and subsequently to Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, leading to poultry outbreaks and sporadic human infections. By late 2003, Southeast Asia had experienced successive H5N1 outbreaks, with the number of infections and deaths peaking in 2006. Since then, almost all such cases have been annually reported. From 1997 to May 26, 2024, 911 human H5N1 infections were reported across 24 countries, with most cases reported between 2004 and 2016, predominantly in Asia and Africa [Figure 1A]. Between 2003 and 2024, 896 individuals were confirmed to have contracted HPAI H5N1 with 463 reported deaths, resulting in an approximate fatality rate of 52%.[2]Figure 1: The global trend of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza and H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks. (A) represents the global trend in human H5N1 infections from January 1997 to August 2024, sourced from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html. The yellow from light to dark corresponds to the increasing number of human cases infected with H5N1. (B) represents the global trend in highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks from January 2005 to August 2024, sourced from https://wahis.woah.org/#/dashboards/qd-dashboard. The blue from light to dark corresponds to the increasing number of avian H5N1 outbreaks. AFRO: African Region of WHO; AMRO: Americas Region of WHO; EMRO: Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO; EURO: European Region of WHO; SEARO: South-East Asia Region of WHO; WPRO: Western Pacific Region of WHO.H5 has spread to &gt;150 avian and 50 mammalian species.[3] The H5N1 currently circulating among wild birds and poultry in most parts of the world predominantly belongs to the 2.3.4.4b clade.[4] Genetically distinct from earlier genotypes, it emerged in 2020 from previously prevalent H5NX subtype viruses and has spread primarily through migratory birds to regions, including Africa, Asia, and Europe. By late 2021, this clade reached North America and subsequently spread to South America by October 2022. The genetic flexibility of HPAI H5N1 from clade 2.3.4.4b allows for extensive reassortment with other AIVs, yielding a diverse array of H5N1&#8211;H5N8 viruses.[5] This efficient reassortment has led to the emergence of &gt;50 genotypes.[6] Although there has been an increase in HPAI H5N1 infections in mammals, reports on mammal-to-mammal transmission remain limited. Between 2021 and April 2024, 28 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported globally. Among the human cases identified as hemagglutinin (HA) H5 clade infections, 13 were caused by the 2.3.4.4b clade.[7] The severity of human illnesses resulting from AIV infection widely varies, ranging from asymptomatic or mild illness to severe disease leading to death. Characteristics of the recent A(H5N1) outbreak. Recent analyses have highlighted that the emergence of H5N1 2.3.4.4b is associated with outbreaks in the United States. This lineage is characterized by increased pathogenicity at non-traditional interfaces, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.[8] On March 25, 2024, the United States detected the HPAI H5N1 strain in dairy cows. Infected cows showed symptoms, such as high fever, dehydration, and reduced milk production.[9] As of August 9, 2024, at least 189 dairy farms across 13 states in the United States have reported H5N1 infections, and there have been four human cases associated with an ongoing multistate outbreak of A(H5N1) in dairy cows.[10,11] The patients were dairy farm workers with epidemiological links to infected cows who presented with conjunctivitis, representing the first instance of human infection following transmission from infected dairy cows. This contrasts with the first United States H5N1 case reported in 2022, in which the patient reported only fatigue and has since recovered. Genomic data suggested that the recent H5N1 outbreak in the United States likely originated from infected birds transmitting the virus to dairy cows in late 2023 or early 2024, with subsequent spread among cow populations for several months. The spread of HAPI H5N1 in cattle poses a risk to humans through close contact with farm workers. Infected lactating cows produce milk containing high levels of the influenza virus, which, if not pasteurized, can contaminate milking equipment and act as a transmission vector for dairy farm workers. The latest study also indicated that both bovine H5N1 and the human 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza viruses remained infectious on common milking equipment surfaces for several hours.[12] The H5N1 2.3.4.4b lineage exhibits strong transmission capabilities, with the potential to spread between birds and mammals. Recent outbreaks have suggested that the 2.3.4.4b lineage may have adapted to infect dairy cows, leading to its spread and infection in cattle. This adaptation allows the virus to be transmitted from cows to humans, specifically in close-contact environments, such as dairy farms, which are highly pathogenic in birds and cause severe disease. In cattle, the virus causes noticeable clinical symptoms, such as high fever and reduced milk production. Humans infected with this lineage show more severe symptoms than earlier H5N1 infections, including conjunctivitis, indicating a possible increase in pathogenicity. Current information suggests that AIV, particularly lineage 2.3.4.4b, may have adapted to mammalian hosts, increasing the likelihood of human infection through interspecies transmission. Public health risk assessment. From a food safety perspective, the consumption of pasteurized milk and properly cooked beef is safe for the public. To verify the safety of the meat supply in the context of H5N1, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and Agricultural Research Service conducted three studies on the safety of beef from cattle affected by avian influenza. As of May 24, 2024, none of the diseased cattle culled at the slaughterhouses had entered the food supply chain, and ground beef samples collected from retail stores in the affected states tested negative for viral particles. Cooking beef to the FSIS-recommended temperatures of 145&#176;F (medium rare) or 160&#176;F (well done) can eliminate the virus, and cooking to 120&#176;F (rare) is sufficient to inactivate the virus substantially.[13] As of May 10, 2024, the USDA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have confirmed that the commercial milk supply is safe, as all sold milk undergoes pasteurization, and milk from infected cows has been either diverted or destroyed. Additionally, none of the 297 samples collected by the FDA at retail points tested positive for live HPAI H5N1.[14] Based on genetic sequencing of US-confirmed cases, the current risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.[15] The HA gene in the conjunctival samples from the Michigan H5N1 patient was identified as clade 2.3.4.4b. Each gene segment was closely related to the B3.13 genotype virus detected in cows by the USDA. These data indicated that the virus detected in both cows and humans retained avian genetic characteristics and lacked the gene expression necessary for efficient human-to-human transmission. However, specific mutations, such as PB2-M631L in Michigan and PB2-E627K in Texas, may enhance the ability of the virus to spread in mammals. Although H5N1 typically prefers binding to &#945;-2,3-sialic acid (SA &#945;-2,3), which is less common in humans, the PB2-E627K and PB2-M631L mutations may enhance the virus's ability to bind to SA &#945;-2,6 on the surface of human lower respiratory epithelial cells. This increased binding capability can improve viral replication efficiency, potentially enhancing the adaptability and transmissibility of H5N1 in mammals, leading to severe respiratory infections and pneumonia.[16] A pathogenicity study based on mice and ferrets revealed that HPAI H5N1 derived from lactating dairy cattle had dual receptor binding specificity, which may induce severe disease after oral ingestion or respiratory infection. Infection by either the oral or respiratory route can lead to systemic spread of the virus to non-respiratory tissues, including the eye, mammary gland, teat, and/or muscle.[17] The rest of the Michigan patient genome closely matched the sequences detected in infected cows, suggesting direct transmission from cows to humans. This sentence is almost identical to the previous statement, so it has been deleted. According to the World Organization for Animal Health, 13,755 H5N1 outbreaks were reported worldwide from 2005 to May 2024, with most occurring in Europe and North America over the past 3 years [Figure 1B]. H5N1 predominantly spreads among birds and poultry and occasionally infects mammals and humans. Prior to the reported cases of H5N1 transmission from dairy cows to humans in the United States, nearly all human H5N1 cases worldwide had a history of contact with poultry or exposure to live bird markets. Although some family clusters were observed, there was no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission. Based on current data, H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds, poultry, cattle, and other animals pose a low risk to the public. However, there is a low-to-moderate risk of infection for individuals who come into contact with H5N1-infected birds or animals or are exposed to environments contaminated by the virus. In addition, the eight major migratory bird routes worldwide can increase the risk of AIV introduction into countries along these routes. The continuous evolution and spread of AIV in animals indicate that the risk of human exposure persists. Consequently, the potential for sporadic cases or even small clusters of human infections remains a concern. Countermeasures for prevention and control. Recombinations and mutations suggest that H5N1 poses a potential threat to the pandemic, necessitating proactive preparedness. This involves focusing on the development and application of tools, such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostic reagents, and capacity building in the areas of surveillance, early warning systems, and response preparedness. The "One Health" concept provides a comprehensive strategy for the control of HPAI, emphasizing the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment. Promoting collaboration, interdisciplinary communication, and coordinated actions among veterinarians, public health experts, environmental scientists, and policymakers can enhance the effectiveness of disease surveillance, prevention, and control measures. Based on this "One Health" concept, current environmental monitoring of H5N1 avian influenza involves comprehensive surveillance strategies targeting both wildlife and domestic poultry, with a focus on detecting and mitigating outbreaks early. Surveillance includes testing migratory birds and poultry for H5N1; sampling environmental materials, such as water and soil; and using advanced diagnostic techniques to identify and characterize virus strains. Despite these efforts, global and local conflicts have challenged information sharing. International bodies, such as the World Health Organization, coordinate data exchange and facilitate global response efforts, whereas regional and local entities work to overcome the barriers posed by geopolitical tensions and conflict zones. Effective communication channels are maintained through public health messaging, collaborative networks, and emergency response planning to ensure the timely and accurate dissemination of information to curb the spread of H5N1 and enhance preparedness across affected areas. Based on this, we offer insights and recommendations for key linkage measures for further responses to H5N1 infection. "Human&#8211;Animal&#8211;Environment" multichannel surveillance and risk assessment. The proactive surveillance of severe syndromes among occupational groups in contact with animals is essential. This primarily involves health monitoring of individuals at a higher risk of exposure to animal pathogens, such as workers in large-scale animal farming, veterinarians, animal slaughter and processing workers, and staff in wildlife conservation areas. Additionally, surveillance for pneumonia of an unknown etiology should be initiated in the general population. Strengthening the reporting awareness of clinical doctors will help collect samples for pathogen identification and conduct epidemiological investigations in a timely manner once cluster cases or serious hospitalized cases are discovered, thereby identifying the potential risk of animal pathogens infecting humans as soon as possible. Close attention should be paid to the global dynamics of avian influenza outbreaks, with particular emphasis on surveillance in high-risk areas. Regular sampling and testing of poultry and wild birds in farms, markets, and natural habitats are recommended to monitor the transmission and mutation of AIV. Enhanced information sharing among the health, agriculture, and forestry departments is necessary to integrate data from various surveillance channels, such as public sentiment, drug sales, respiratory syndrome reports, testing, and imaging. Key monitoring focuses include the epidemiological characteristics of human infections with avian influenza, viral mutations, transmission capabilities, and clinical severity. Increasing the frequency of risk assessments, early warning systems, and the development of precise and effective early warning technologies enables multipoint triggering and timely implementation of relevant preventive and control measures. Conventional surveillance methods, including pathogen genome sequencing, laboratory diagnostics, and mortality surveillance, are inadequate in the face of complex and rapidly evolving threats. Wastewater monitoring is a critical tool, as demonstrated during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.[18] Strengthening animal disease surveillance is also highly recommended, particularly to gain a deeper understanding of the activities and movements of migratory birds. It is essential to enhance monitoring of poultry around migratory bird habitats, increase environmental and animal surveillance along migratory bird migration routes, and boost sampling proportions and frequencies. Utilizing monitoring devices and regular patrols enables real-time monitoring of high-risk areas, ensuring the prompt detection and management of outbreak events. Protection for occupational groups and objective Public Health education. For individuals who come into contact with infected birds or other animals owing to their occupation, including those working in wildlife reserves, poultry farms, or dairies, individuals raising birds, and personnel responding to avian influenza outbreaks in birds or other animals, it is crucial to enhance their awareness of protective measures. When directly or closely interacting with deceased poultry or livestock, they must strictly adhere to protocols for wearing personal protective equipment. Additionally, before entering spaces where these animals reside or have not yet been disinfected, they should undergo comprehensive personal protection training. Physicians should be alert from a clinical perspective to recognize a history of avian exposure, such as in cattle, in patients with associated H5N1 symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, and assist in confirming the diagnosis of H5N1 infection with polymerase chain reaction testing and lung imaging to assess the presence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Following confirmation of the diagnosis, antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, should be administered immediately, and treatment should be initiated at an earlier onset if possible. Support, such as oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, may be required for critically ill patients and to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Patients should be hospitalized and isolated, and healthcare workers should be strictly protected. Influenza vaccination is recommended in high-risk occupational groups. Furthermore, to avoid unnecessary panic, we recommend providing the public with accurate and truthful reports on the outbreak and conducting objective and appropriate health education without exaggerating the situation. The public should be reminded to avoid contact with sick or deceased animals, including wild birds, poultry, domesticated birds; and other wild or domestic animals, and animal waste, litter, or materials contaminated with birds or animals that are suspected or confirmed to be infected with AIV. Additionally, it is important to avoid slaughtering or consuming diseased or dead poultry and livestock and to refrain from consuming undercooked foods, such as raw milk or cheese that have not been pasteurized. Development of novel vaccines and technological preparedness. Currently, seasonal influenza vaccines do not prevent the spread of AIV in humans globally. Several countries are developing H5N1 avian influenza vaccines for emergency preparedness. In the United States, three H5N1 vaccines, developed from earlier strains of HPAI H5N1 (A/Vietnam, clade 1, and A/Indonesia, clade 2.1), with (MF59-CSL, Seqirus, Melbourne, Australia or AS03-GSK, Brentford, United Kingdom) or without adjuvants (Sanofi Pasteur, Lille, France), are licensed and stockpiled for pre-pandemic preparedness.[19] A recent study showed that adults who received three licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines generated cross-neutralizing antibodies against the circulating HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in humans.[20] Individuals vaccinated with the two licensed adjuvanted H5N1 vaccines generated cross-reactive binding and cross-neutralizing antibodies against the HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 virus. Seroconversion rates of 60&#8211;95% against H5 clade 2.3.4.4b were recorded after two doses of AS03-adjuvanted-A/Indonesia or three doses of MF59-adjuvanted-A/Vietnam vaccine. Additionally, a monovalent messenger RNA (mRNA) lipid nanoparticle vaccine expressing 2.3.4.4b was immunogenic and protective in preclinical animal models, with H5-reactive antibody levels increasing approximately eightfold after the second dose compared with those before the booster.[21] The advantage of this vaccine is that it can be rapidly produced without the need to isolate and adapt to a viral strain that grows effectively in fertilized chicken eggs or cell cultures. The manufacture of a novel mRNA vaccine can begin within hours of sequencing a new pandemic viral strain. Considering the pandemic potential of H5N1, efforts should be made to develop stockpiled vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tools. It is important to monitor the latest internationally shared AIV sequences, further survey relevant variants that may affect outbreak trends, and analyze key mutations and dynamic changes in virus sequences. For example, PB2-E627K and PB2-M631L in PB2 influence how well a vaccine protects against different influenza strains. If vaccines are developed based on strains lacking these mutations, they may be less effective against the strains carrying either E627K or M631L. Thus, inclusion of these mutations in vaccine strain selection is crucial for maintaining vaccine effectiveness. The presence of these mutations highlights the need for continuous surveillance and updating vaccines to ensure that they cover the most current and relevant strains. This may involve modifying vaccine composition or developing new vaccines to address emerging viral variants. This will allow for timely updates on vaccine strains, diagnostic primers, and sequences, thereby ensuring readiness for potential pandemics. In addition, continued support for the development of universal influenza vaccines is crucial. Establishing a stable pandemic simulation team for emerging infectious diseases can aid scenario-based pandemic preparedness and intervention evaluation studies and enhance decision-making capabilities for pandemic response readiness. Other valuable practices for reference. The "physical isolation and culling" strategy is commonly used in many countries. However, large-scale culling measures can cause economic losses to the poultry industry. For example, owing to recurring avian influenza outbreaks in the United Kingdom, over 5.5 million birds were culled between October 2021 and November 2022. In the United States, the avian influenza outbreak in 2022 led to the deaths of approximately 40 million animals, resulting in economic losses estimated between US$2.5 billion and US$3 billion.[22] As a large global producer and consumer of agricultural products, China has maintained its stability during recent outbreaks over the past 5 years. There have been no widespread poultry infections or culling, and poultry production has remained relatively steady, despite frequent global avian influenza outbreaks. Since 2004, China has implemented immunization against H5 and/or H7 HPAI in all domestically raised poultry. Furthermore, China mandates a 100% vaccination coverage rate and ensures that the annual qualification rate of immunization antibodies remains &gt;70%.[23] By the end of 2022, over 300 billion doses of various vaccines developed in China were administered, both domestically and internationally. Currently, two H5 vaccine seed viruses, H5-Re13, which targets the clade 2.3.4.4h virus that emerged in China in 2017, and H5-Re14, which addresses the clade 2.3.4.4b virus circulating globally, are used alongside the H7N9 vaccine seed virus H7-Re4 in the production of the trivalent vaccine.[24] Between 2002 and 2010, more than 113 billion vaccines were administered worldwide. Five countries have adopted national routine interpoultry immunization programs, accounting for 99% of vaccine use: China (90.9%), Egypt (4.6%), Indonesia (2.3%), Vietnam (1.4%), and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (&lt;0.01%). The high vaccine coverage enabled the prevention of clinical diseases and deaths in poultry, such as poultry fowl, reduction of human cases, maintenance of rural livelihoods, and food security.[25] Thus, this "culling and vaccination" strategy, distinctive to China, has significantly reduced losses during avian influenza outbreaks and offers valuable lessons for global control efforts against highly pathogenic H5N1.
