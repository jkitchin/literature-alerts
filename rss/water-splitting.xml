      <title>CoFe2O4 with the In&#8208;Situ Formed Oxygen Vacancies and Co Particles as an Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202403229</link>
      <description>Ren Z, Sujie Jiang, Keke Su, Wenfeng Liu, Fuquan Niu, Zhenpu Shi, Zhansheng Lu, Yuantao Cui, Shuting Yang, Yanhong Yin, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403538257

                Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (RZABs) are considered as one of the most promising clean energy device due to their abundant resources, low cost and environmental friendliness. However, their energy efficiency and cycle life are far from satisfactory due to the poor activity and stability of bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in air cathode. In this work, an efficient bi&#8208;functional catalyst (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co) was derived from its precursor (rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4) through a simple annealing process. Electrochemical measurements prove that rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co with the in&#8208;situ formed Co nano particles and rich oxygen vacancies appears excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity compared to its counterpart. Its half&#8208;wave potential is 0.81 V (vs RHE) and the OER overpotential is only 310 mV (vs RHE). In addition, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries assembled with rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4/Co show the highest peak power density (128.9 mW cm&#8208;2) and cycling stability compared to rGO&#8208;CoFe2O4 and commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO2 catalysts. This work provides a simple strategy for the design of advanced bifunctional catalysts.</description>

      <title>Sequential oxygen evolution and decoupled water splitting via electrochemical redox reaction of nickel hydroxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53310-5</link>
      <description>Jie Wei, Yangfan Shao, Jingbo Xu, Fang Yin, Zejian Li, Haitao Qian, Yinping Wei, Liang Chang, Yu Han, Jia Li, Lin Gan, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403540533

                Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising low-cost strategy for clean and sustainable hydrogen production but is largely limited by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the challenges in maintaining adequate separation between H2 and O2. Here, we reveal an anodic-cathodic sequential oxygen evolution process via electrochemical oxidation and subsequent reduction of Ni hydroxides, enabling much lower overpotentials than conventional anodic oxygen evolution. By using (isotope-labeled) differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and in situ Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations, we evidence that the sequential oxygen evolution originates from the electrochemical oxidation of Ni hydroxides to NiOO&#8211; active species while undergoing a different, reductive step of NiOO&#8211; for the final release of O2 due to weakened Ni&#8211;O covalency. Based on this sequential process, we propose and demonstrate a hybrid water electrolysis and energy storage device, which enables time-decoupled hydrogen and oxygen evolution and electrochemical energy storage in the Ni hydroxides. The authors report a sequential oxygen evolution process via electrochemical oxidation and reduction of Ni hydroxides, allowing for decoupled oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution during water splitting and energy storage in the Ni hydroxides.</description>

                Manganese is a key metal involved in the catalysis of natural photosynthesis. Thus, the investigation of Mn&#8208;based electrocatalysts for water oxidation is of high importance. This work reports the doping of Mo into &#945;&#8208;MnO2 nanorods to improve the water oxidation performance. The doping of Mo can transform the microstructure of &#945;&#8208;MnO2 from nanorods into nanosphere superstructures. As a dopant, Mo expands the &#945;&#8208;MnO2 lattice to result in a decrease in the average oxidation state of Mn and the generation of oxygen vacancies, which are beneficial to water oxidation catalysis. Under optimized doping, the OER overpotential of Mo/&#945;&#8208;MnO2 is reduced by 80 mV (at 10 mA/cm2) compared with pure &#945;&#8208;MnO2.</description>

                NiFe-based nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising catalysts to replace platinum, ruthenium and iridium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; production process through water splitting. Using iron (2+) sulfate and nickel acetate as the raw materials, with the molar ratio of Ni acetate to iron (2+) sulfate controlled at 8:5, the concentration of metal-ion was 0.6 mol/L, and precursor fibers rich in Ni2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2&#8722; were prepared using electrospinning technology, with polyvinyl alcohol acting as the colloid. Subsequently, composite nanorods rich in the elements of Ni, Fe, S, and C were successfully obtained at a heat treatment temperature of 1000&#176;C in an Ar gas atmosphere. The results demonstrate that the nanorod samples possessed a surface diameter of ~200 nm, and the main phases of the nanorods after heat treatment at 1000&#176;C included FeNi3 alloy, (Fe,Ni)9S8, Ni4S3, and amorphous C. Electrochemical performance tests conducted in a 1.0 mol/L KOH solution exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction properties of the catalysts prepared using FeNi3/(Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni4S3/C nanorods as the materials. The overpotential was about 258.6 mV of the catalyst material at 10 mA&#61589;cm&#8722;2.</description>

                Abstract Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a promising cost&#8208;efficient catalyst to replace noble metals for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet its intrinsic activity under high current density conditions is not satisfactory, which greatly constrains the industrial application of NiFe LDH catalysts. Herein, a new class of integrated Co and W co&#8208;doped NiFe LDH catalysts is reported with dual cocatalytic sites for alkaline OER catalysis. The optimized Co 2.8 , W 3.8 &#8208;NiFe LDH integrated catalyst has superior alkaline OER activity (255 mV@1000 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and excellent catalytic stability (200 h@500 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The turnover frequency value of Co 2.8 , W 3.8 &#8208;NiFe LDH can reach 4.02 s &#8722;1 at 1.49 V versus RHE, which is 9.6 times higher than that of NiFe LDH and superior to the noble metal catalysts. Moreover, it can achieve 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.86 V and maintain 300&#8208;h stable operation in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Theoretical and experimental studies indicate that W sites promote the *OH adsorption and Co sites favor protons desorption of OH*. These dual cocatalytic sites jointly promote *O coverage, effectively accelerating alkaline OER kinetic.</description>

      <title>Biomass-Derived-Carbon-Supported Spinel Cobalt Molybdate as High-Efficiency Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29204953</link>

                Ananas comosus leaves were converted to a porous graphitized carbon (GPLC) material via a high-temperature pyrolysis method by employing iron salt as a catalyst. A cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4)-and-GPLC composite (CoMoO4/GPLC) was then prepared by engineering CoMoO4 nanorods in situ, grown on GPLC. N2 adsorption&#8211;desorption isothermal curves and a pore size distribution curve verify that the proposed composite possesses a porous structure and a large specific surface area, which are favorable for charge and reactant transport and the rapid escape of O2 bubbles. Consequently, the as-synthesized CoMoO4/GPLC shows low overpotentials of 289 mV and 399 mV to afford the current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is superior to many CoMoO4-based catalysts in previous studies. In addition, the decrease in current density is particularly small, with a reduction rate of 3.2% after a continuous OER procedure for 30 h, indicating its good stability. The excellent performance of the CoMoO4/GPLC composite proves that the GPLC carrier can obviously impel the catalytic activity of CoMoO4 by improving electrical conductivity, enhancing mass transport and exposing more active sites of the composite. This work provides an effective strategy for the efficient conversion of waste ananas comosus leaves to a biomass-derived-carbon-supported Co-Mo-based OER electrocatalyst with good performance, which may represent a potential approach to the development of new catalysts for OER, as well as the treatment of waste biomass.</description>

                Abstract Advancements in single-atom-based catalysts are crucial for enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance while reducing precious metal usage. A comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanisms will expedite this progress further. Here we report Ir single atoms coordinated out-of-plane with dimethylimidazole (MI) on CoFe hydroxide (Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI). This Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI catalyst, which was prepared using a simple immersion method, delivers ultralow overpotentials of 179 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and 257 mV at 600 mA cm &#8722;2 as well as an ultra-small Tafel slope of 24 mV dec &#8722;1 . Furthermore, Ir 1 /(Co,Fe)-OH/MI has a total mass activity exceeding that of commercial IrO 2 by a factor of 58.4. Ab initio simulations indicate that the coordination of MI leads to electron redistribution around the Ir sites. This causes a positive shift in the d -band centre at adjacent Ir and Co sites, facilitating an optimal energy pathway for OER.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Membrane&#8208;Free Hybrid Water Electrolysis for Low&#8208;Cost Hydrogen Production Along with Value&#8208;Added Products</title>

                Abstract Water electrolysis using renewable energy is considered as a promising technique for sustainable and green hydrogen production. Conventional water electrolysis has two components &#8211; hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the cathode and anode respectively. However, electrolysis of water suffers from high overpotential due to the slow kinetics of OER. To overcome this hybrid water electrolysis has been developed by replacing conventional anode oxidation producing oxygen with oxidation of cost&#8208;effective materials producing value&#8208;added chemicals. This review summarizes recent advances in organic oxidative reactions such as alcohols, urea, hydrazine, and biomass at the anode instead of OER. Furthermore, the review also highlights the use of membrane&#8208;free hybrid water electrolysis as a method to overcome the cost and complexity associated with conventional membrane&#8208;based electrolyzer thereby improving overall efficiency. This approach holds promise for scalable and cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale hydrogen production along with value&#8208;added products. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed for further development in membrane&#8208;free hybrid water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>RuCo@C Hollow Nanoprisms Derived from ZIF&#8208;67 for Enhanced Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401862</link>

                Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) are commonly used to create complex hollow structures for energy applications. This study presents a simple method to produce a novel hollow nanoprism Co@C hierarchical composite from ZIF&#8208;67 through high&#8208;temperature treatment at 800 &#176;C. This composite serves as a platform for Ru nanoparticle deposition, forming RuCo@C hollow nanoprism (RuCo@C HNP). As an electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH, RuCo@C HNP exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, with a low overpotential of 32 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 39.67 mV dec&#8722;1, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 3.83 s&#8722;1 at &#414;200, and stable performance over 50 h. It also achieves a low &#414;10 of 266 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 45.22 mV dec&#8722;1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru doping in Ni/Co maintains a low water dissociation barrier, reduces the energy barrier for the OER rate&#8208;determining step, and creates active sites for H*, enhancing adsorption/desorption abilities. These results are attributed to the synergy between Co and Ru and the hollow prism structure's increased surface area. This method for synthesizing hollow structures using ZIF composites shows promise for applications in the energy sector.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts with low cost, high catalytic activity, and robust stability remains a formidable challenge for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, highly dispersed ultrasmall PtPdFeCoNi high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles with a size of &#8776; 2 nm and randomly distributed multimetallic single atoms spatially immobilized on the 3D hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon skeleton (denoted as PtPdFeCoNi/HOPNC) are successfully synthesized via ultra&#8208;rapid Joule heating process. The spatial immobilization on 3D HOPNC skeleton is the key to the high dispersion of multi&#8208;active sites of oxygen electrocatalysts, and the formed hierarchical pore structure is conducive to the successful construction of the rapid mass transfer channel. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared PtPdFeCoNi/HOPNC exhibits a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.866 V versus RHE for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and low Tafel slopes for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, ZAB using PtPdFeCoNi/HOPNC as bifunctional oxygen catalysts exhibits excellent rate performances and superior cycling stability, surpassing that of a commercial Pt/C&#8208;RuO 2 mixture. The spatial immobilization strategy of HOPNC provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of efficient catalysts for various applications.</description>

      <title>Creating Spin Channels in SrCoO3 through Triagonal&#8208;to&#8208;Cubic Structural Transformation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution/Reduction Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202415797</link>

                Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</description>

                Abstract Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre&#8208;catalysts with highly improved activity.</description>

                Abstract The construction of highly efficient and self&#8208;supported electrocatalysts with abundant active sites for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alkaline water splitting is significantly challenging. Herein, Co and MoC nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co&#8208;MoC/NCNFs) which display a bamboo&#8208;like morphology are prepared by electrospinning followed by the carbonization method. The electrospun MoC possesses an ultrasmall size (&#8776;5 nm) which can provide more active sites during electrocatalysis, while the introduction of Co greatly optimizes the electronic structure of MoC. Both endow the Co&#8208;MoC/NCNFs with superior HER performances over a wide pH range, with low overpotentials of 86, 116, and 145 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits remarkable alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 254 mV to reach 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Density functional theory calculations confirm that electron transfer from Co to MoC regulates the adsorption free energy for hydrogen, thereby promoting HER. Moreover, an electrolyzer assembled with Co&#8208;MoC/NCNFs requires only a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. This work opens new pathways for the design of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.</description>

                Abstract Converting solar energy into electrochemical energy is a sustainable strategy, but the design of photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) with efficient utilization of sunlight faces huge challenges. Herein, a photo&#8208;assisted ZAB of a three&#8208;electrode system using MoS 2 /oxygen vacancies&#8208;rich TiO 2 heterojunction as charge cathode and Fe, N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeNC) as discharge cathode is constructed, where MoS 2 is chosen as solar light&#8208;responsive catalytic material and TiO 2 acts as electron transport layer and hole blocking layer, arising from a train of thought for efficient charging under sunlight irradiation and light&#8208;independent discharging. The introduction of oxygen vacancies in TiO 2 facilitates the temporary trapping of carriers and triggers rapid carrier transfer at the interface of the heterojunction, which hinders the recombination of photogenerated holes, thereby facilitating their further participation in the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, FeNC exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction performance due to strong d&#8208;&#960; interactions. As a result, the well&#8208;built ZABs deliver a low charge voltage (0.71 V) under illumination at 0.1 mA cm &#8722;2 , and a high power density (167.6 mW cm &#8722;2 ) in dark. This work paves a special way for the development of ZABs by directly harvesting solar energy in charging and efficiently discharging regardless of lighting conditions.</description>

                Abstract The development of an excellent multifunctional electrocatalyst that is based on non&#8208;precious metal is critical for improving the electrochemical processes of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in alkaline media. This study demonstrates that incorporating Mo into Co 3 O 4 facilitated the formation of rich oxygen vacancies (Vo), which promotes effective nitrate adsorption and activation in urea electrolysis. Subsequently, in situ/operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy is used to explore the active sites in Mo&#8208;Co 3 O 4 &#8208;3 under OER, indicating the oxygen vacancies are first filled with OH &#8226; in Mo&#8208;Co 3 O 4 ; facilitated the pre&#8208;oxidation of low&#8208;valence Co, and promoted the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co&#8208;OOH &#8226; . Mo&#8208;Co 3 O 4 &#8208;3 electrocatalysts show impressive HER, OER, and UOR with low overpotentials of 141 mV, 220 mV, and 1.32 V, respectively, at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, in situ/Operando Raman spectroscopy results reveal the importance of CoOOH active sites for enhanced electrochemical performance in Mo&#8208;Co 3 O 4 &#8208;3 compared to the pure Co 3 O 4 . The urea electrolyzer with Mo&#8208;Co 3 O 4 electrocatalysts acts as an anode and the cathode delivers 1.42 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . A viable approach to creating effective UOR electrocatalysts involves synergistic engineering exploiting doping and oxygen vacancies.</description>

                NiFe-based nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising catalysts to replace platinum, ruthenium and iridium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; production process through water splitting. Using iron (2+) sulfate and nickel acetate as the raw materials, with the molar ratio of Ni acetate to iron (2+) sulfate controlled at 8:5, the concentration of metal-ion was 0.6 mol/L, and precursor fibers rich in Ni2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2&#8722; were prepared using electrospinning technology, with polyvinyl alcohol acting as the colloid. Subsequently, composite nanorods rich in the elements of Ni, Fe, S, and C were successfully obtained at a heat treatment temperature of 1000&#176;C in an Ar gas atmosphere. The results demonstrate that the nanorod samples possessed a surface diameter of ~200 nm, and the main phases of the nanorods after heat treatment at 1000&#176;C included FeNi3 alloy, (Fe,Ni)9S8, Ni4S3, and amorphous C. Electrochemical performance tests conducted in a 1.0 mol/L KOH solution exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction properties of the catalysts prepared using FeNi3/(Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni4S3/C nanorods as the materials. The overpotential was about 258.6 mV of the catalyst material at 10 mA&#61589;cm&#8722;2.</description>

                Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) play crucial roles in energy conversion processes such as water splitting and air batteries, where spin dynamics inherently influence their efficiency. However, the specific contribution of spin has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we intentionally introduce a spin channel through the transformation of trigonal antiferromagnetic SrCoO2.5 into cubic ferromagnetic SrCoO3, aiming to deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in catalytic reactions. Based on the results from spherical&#8208;aberration&#8208;corrected microscope, synchrotron absorption spectra, magnetic characterizations, and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that surface electron transfer is predominantly governed by local geometric structures, while the presence of the spin channel significantly enhances the bulk transport of spin&#8208;polarized electrons, particularly under high current densities where surface electron transfer is no longer the limiting factor. The overpotential for OER is reduced by at least 70 mV at 150 mA cm&#8208;2 due to the enhanced conductivity from spin&#8208;polarized electrons facilitated by spin channels, with an expectation of even more significant reductions at higher current densities. This work provides a clearer picture of the role of spin in oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient catalytic systems in practical applications.</description>

                The need for efficient, economical, and clean energy systems is increasing, and as a result, interest in water-splitting techniques to produce green hydrogen is also increasing. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the practical application and widespread use of water-splitting technologies; therefore, to address this challenge, it is essential to develop cost-effective and efficient OER catalysts. In this work, we have synthesized an inexpensive and tunable FeCoMn Prussian blue analogue (PBAs) as an efficient OER catalyst via a straightforward process.

                The development of cost-effective and high-performance bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting is crucial for achieving sustainable clean energy. In this study, a metal/carbide hybrid (NiFeMo/NiFeMoCx) was prepared through fast and facile cathodic plasma electrolytic deposition. Due to the synergistic effect between the metal and carbide, NiFeMo/NiFeMoCx exhibited high activity in both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of 230 mV and 60 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In addition, robust stability was demonstrated during the overall water splitting (1.52 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, with little degradation after 18 h of catalysis). This work provides a useful strategy for designing advanced water splitting catalysts for real application.</description>

                The solvothermal reactions involving cobalt ions with 5-methylisophthalic acid (H2MIP) and 1,3-bis(2-methylimidazol)propane (BMIP) yielded two cobalt(II) organic frameworks: {[Co4(MIP)4(BMIP)3]&#183;1/2DMA}n (SNUT-31) and {[Co4(MIP)4(BMIP)3]&#183;(EtOH)2&#183;H2O]}n (SNUT-32) where DMA represents N,N-dimethylacetamide and EtOH signifies ethyl alcohol. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that SNUT-31 and SNUT-32 possess an isomorphic structure, featuring a unique 2-fold interpenetration of 3D frameworks in a parallel manner. Notably, both SNUT-31 and SNUT-32 demonstrate remarkable performance in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions and exhibit exceptional photocatalytic degradation capabilities against a model comprising three distinct dyes: rhodamine B, methyl orange, and methyl blue.</description>

                Chiral inorganic materials possess unique asymmetric properties that could significantly impact various fields. However, their practical application has been hindered by challenges in creating structurally robust chiral materials. We report the synthesis of well-defined chiral-shaped hollow cobalt oxide nanostructures, extendable to a family of chalcogenides including sulfide, selenide, and telluride through topological transformations. Taking chiral cobalt oxide nanostructures as a representative material, we demonstrate precise control over their chiral architectures, enabling fine-tuning of parameters, such as twist degrees, handedness, and compositions. These chiral nanostructures exhibit high spin selectivity effects that influence the electron transfer processes in catalytic reactions. Leveraging this spin-selective behavior, the chiral cobalt oxide nanoarchitectures demonstrate enhanced electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction compared to their achiral counterparts. Our findings not only expand the library of chiral inorganic materials but also advance the application of chiral effects in fields such as catalysis, spintronics, and beyond.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal compounds (TMCs) are potentially fruitful substitutes for noble metals for electrocatalytic splitting of water due to their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, modifiable morphology, tunable electronic structure and their earth&#8208;abundance. The combination of TMCs with graphene improves the dispersion of loaded catalysts, providing more catalytic active sites, enhancing the conductivity of hybrids, affording accelerated charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, and minimizing catalyst bleaching, aggregation, and sintering under harsh reaction conditions. Additionally, graphene incorporation into TMCs modulates the electronic structure of active centers because of the synergistic interaction between them, thereby improving their catalytic performance. This review paper focuses on the recent progress made in designing different graphene&#8208;transition metal&#8208;based materials that can be used in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS). In&#8208;situ characterization methodologies and DFT calculations that facilitate catalyst development are discussed elaborately. Finally, the advancements made in the development of graphene&#8208;supported transition metal compounds for use in a functional water electrolyzer have been explored. In conclusion, a few specific recommendations have been made about the current challenges related to the widespread production of effective HER/OER electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.</description>

                In this research, the electronic states, band structures, and bond properties of the framework compounds of CoPO4, Co1-xFexPO4, and Co1&#8211;xNixPO4 were investigated by the density functional theory calculations. The potential capabilities of these systems in the photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen were analyzed. The spin-up electron densities of states for the CoPO4, Co1&#8211;xFexPO4, and Co1&#8211;xNixPO4 systems have band gaps of 2.7, 3.4, and 3.45 eV, respectively. The band of spin-down electron states has several energy gaps above the Fermi level. The density of states of electron with spin up near the Fermi level is obviously greater than that of electrons with spin down. In this case, localized states of electrons appear in the band gap of doped semiconductors due to impurity atoms. The calculated value of the energy at the lower edge of the conduction band for CoPO4 was &#8211;0.7 eV, which is more negative than the energy required for water splitting. Meanwhile, the calculated value of the energy at the upper edge of the valence band was 2.01 eV, which is more positive than the oxygen evolution energy of 1.23 eV.</description>

                Abstract High&#8208;efficient and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are desirable to Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). However, most of catalysts in powder form with sole active sites remain challenging in achieving the satisfactory bifunctional catalysis and suffer from peeling off during the long&#8208;term operation. Herein, hybrid CoFe active sites are constructed containing nanoalloys (&#8776;10 nm), clusters (&lt; 2 nm), and single atoms on aerophilic carbon fiber membranes as binder&#8208;free air cathodes for ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life ZABs. In particular, the high air&#8208;permeability of membranes (0.2 s) can prevent the active sites from blocking by O 2 bubbles and promote the mass transfer. The theoretical and experimental results confirm that the hydrophilic CoFe 2 O 4 /CoFeOOH sites reconstructed on the surface of CoFe nanoalloys are mainly responsible for OER. While for single atoms and clusters on nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon matrix, they play a synergetic role in optimizing the adsorption energy to enhance ORR activity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts exhibit an ultra&#8208;low ORR/OER potential gap (0.64 V). When further assembled as freestanding air&#8208;electrodes, it exhibits an outstanding cycling lifespan of 1200 and 155 h in liquid&#8208; and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs respectively, which are fivefold and twofold higher than those of powder&#8208;based cathodes (240/67 h).</description>

                Abstract The escalating global demand for clean and sustainable energy has ignited significant interest in hydrogen production through water splitting. A major challenge in this pursuit is the development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we present the synthesis of a novel two-dimensional d-Ti&#8323;CN @CdSe nanocomposite, designed as a high-performance electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Synthesized via hydrothermal methods, the nanocomposite was characterized using advanced characterization techniques viz. Raman spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, and SEM/EDS. Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that the d-Ti&#8323;CN @CdSe nanocomposite significantly enhances catalytic performance compared to its individual components, achieving a low overpotential of 232 mV for HER at 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; and reducing the OER overpotential from 498.3 mV for d-Ti&#8323;CN MXene to 382.2 mV in the nanocomposite at 30 mA cm&#8315;&#178;. Additionally, it exhibits excellent stability, retaining about 75.37% of its current density after 36 hours of continuous operation. This remarkable performance is attributed to the synergistic interactions between CdSe nanoparticles and Ti&#8323;CN MXene layers, which prevent restacking, increase the electrochemically active surface area, and enhance charge transfer efficiency. These features position the d-Ti&#8323;CN @CdSe nanocomposite as a promising candidate for scalable and sustainable water-splitting applications.</description>

                Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4% at pH 7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.</description>

                Abstract Water oxidation, a crucial step in electrochemical water splitting, is often hindered by its complex kinetics. In our pursuit of designing efficient electrocatalysts, we have found that morphological modifications during synthesis are powerful tools. By manipulating various parameters, such as reaction time and temperature, we have tuned the morphology of the catalysts, leading to a significant enhancement in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate. Our thorough research involves using a simple hydrothermal method for synthesizing bimetallic Ni&#8211;Cu oxides, resulting in the emergence of different morphologies by varying reaction times from 4 to 24 h. The OER performance in an alkaline medium, using a 1 M KOH solution, has been meticulously investigated, and our results have unveiled the highest activity for Ni&#8211;Cu fabricated with a growth time of 24 h. Ni&#8211;Cu oxide 24 exhibits a remarkably low onset potential for OER at 222 mV with a Tafel slope of 373 mV/dec. The catalyst boasts the lowest R ct value of 2.788 ohm, ensuring faster charge transfer rates and stability up to 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, thereby supporting its electrochemical applications for water splitting.</description>

                Efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for clean energy generation through water splitting. This study presents a FeNiCoCuMo high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) synthesized via mechanical alloying (MA) and sintering using hot&#8208;pressing. The energy transfer from the milling process influences phase transformations, with the High&#8208;Entropy Alloys Prediction Software (HEAPS) predicting the formation of an FCC phase. X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy reveal an FCC phase after 150 h of milling, with no elemental segregation observed. The Burgio kinetic model estimates 448 kJ mol &#8722;1 is needed to achieve a 99% FCC phase. The crystallite size is 4 nm, with a lattice parameter of 0.371 nm. The as&#8208;milled phases were preserved during hot&#8208;pressing sintering. Electrodes (M1, M2, M3) fabricated from the HEA demonstrated high electrocatalytic efficiency, with an average overpotential of 380 mV and Tafel slope of 77 mV dec &#8722;1 . At a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , the electrodes maintained operation for up to 100 h. The synergy between constituent elements is key to the superior electrocatalytic performance of FeNiCoCuMo HEAs, demonstrating their potential as promising materials for OER electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of Multiscale NiFeMn Multi-Principal Element Alloys with Tailored Composition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2752-5724/ad89e1</link>
      <description>Shahryar Mooraj, Jintao Fu, Shuai Feng, Alexander K. Ng, Eric B. Duoss, Sarah E. Baker, Cheng Zhu, Eric Detsi, Wen Chen, Materials Futures. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403628641

                Abstract Nanostructured multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have been explored as next-generation engineering materials due to unique mechanical and functional properties which have significant advantages over traditional dilute alloys. However, the practical applications of nanostructured MPEAs are still limited due to the lack of scalable processing approaches to prepare a large quantity of nanostructured MPEAs, as well as lack of an efficient pathway for high-throughput discovery of better functional nanostructured MPEAs within their vast compositional space. Here we tackle these challenges by presenting an integrated approach by combining direct-ink-writing-based additive manufacturing, solid-state sintering, and chemical dealloying to manufacture hierarchically porous MPEAs. The hierarchical structure is comprised of macro- and micro-scale pores introduced via extrusion printing and polymer decomposition during sintering, as well as nanoscale pores formed via chemical dealloying. The macro- and micro-scale pores allow efficient dealloying of a large mass of material as the diffusion length that the corroding medium must penetrate remains at the scale of the ligaments formed after sintering (~10 &#956;m), despite the large volume of the 3D-printed samples. In addition, this integrated approach enables versatile control of the alloy composition via precisely tuning the ratio of elemental powders in the starting ink, thus offering a pathway for high-throughput discovery of novel functional MPEAs. As a case study, multiscale macro/micro/nanoporous NiFeMn MPEAs with three different compositions were investigated as catalysts to reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where NiFeMn-based electrocatalysts display composition-dependent performance such that the overpotential measured at a current of 0.5 A/g for OER increases in the order of Ni58Fe29Mn13 &#8804; Ni64Fe26Mn10 &lt; Ni76Fe18Mn6. This introduced manufacturing process offers new opportunities for scalable fabrication and rapid screening of nanostructured multi-component complex alloys. &amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Abiotic factors that prompt major ecological transitions: Are fish on land to escape an intolerable aquatic environment?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.14672</link>

                Abstract Colonisation of novel habitats are important events in evolution, but the factors that initially prompt such ecological transitions are often unknown. The invasion of land by fish is an extreme habitat transition that offers an opportunity to empirically investigate the causes of major ecological transitions. The intertidal ecotone&#8212;and rock pools in particular&#8212;have been an important staging ground for transitions onto land. Classic hypotheses focus on the adverse abiotic conditions of rock pools at low tide as the instigator of fish voluntarily stranding themselves out of water, which can then lead to the evolution of an amphibious lifestyle. To test these hypotheses, we studied the abiotic conditions of 54 rock pools on the island of Guam where there are various species of aquatic, amphibious and terrestrial blenny fishes. We found little support for the expected deterioration of abiotic conditions in standing pools at low tide (salinity, pH and oxygen), and fish were not seen to be excluded from those pools that were found to exhibit poor abiotic conditions (temperature, salinity and pH). Hypoxia was the only factor that might account for the absence of blennies from certain rock pools. Next, we experimentally measured oxygen depletion by an aquatic, mildly amphibious and highly amphibious species of blenny found on Guam in a simulated rockpool to infer the proportion of rock pools at low tide outside the tolerable range of blennies. Rock pools were found to have oxygen levels within the requirements of most blennies and those of other marine fishes reported in the literature. We conclude that the abiotic environment of rock pools alone was unlikely to have instigated the evolution of amphibious behaviour in blennies, at least on Guam. Instead, the broad range of abiotic conditions experienced in rock pools suggests these conditions could have primed amphibious blennies to better endure the novel conditions on land. Any ecotone typified by fluctuations or gradients in abiotic conditions is likely a key transitional environment for the invasion of novel habitats and, as such, are an important location for adaptive evolution and species diversification.

      <title>Domain evolution in BiFeO3 epitaxial nanoisland array via post-annealing</title>

                We describe the impact of post-annealing on ferroelectric-domain structures in arrays of BiFeO3 (BFO) epitaxial nanoislands, which exhibit a domain evolution from an initial 71&#176; stripe/vortex domains to center-convergent topological domains. These results suggest that the increase and redistribution of charged defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies, in BFO nanoislands play a crucial role in driving the formation of center-type domain structures. The observation of defect-driven domain evolution in BFO nanoislands provides a path for further exploring their formation mechanism, topological properties, novel functionalities, and potential applications.</description>

                Abstract Temperature and oxygen levels drive the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits in marine invertebrates, including crustaceans. Environmental conditions are also expected to prompt the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs), which are vital for energy production via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. We formally tested for adaptive evolution in mitochondrial protein-coding genes in representatives of the decapod infraorder Achelata, including two spiny lobsters, Panulirus echinatus and P. interruptus , for which we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (15,644 and 15,659 bp long, respectively). A phylomitogenomic analysis supported the monophyly of the genus Panulirus , the families Palinuridae and Scyllaridae, and the infraorder Achelata. Over the strong negative selection background observed for mitochondrial PCGs in the Achelata, signatures of positive selective pressure were detected within PCGs in equatorial Panulirus spp. and deepwater Scyllaridae. In Panulirus spp. inhabiting equatorial latitudes with consistently high temperatures, the Datamonkey analysis RELAX suggested intensified purifying selection strength in 9 of the 13 PCGs and relaxation in purifying selection strength in atp6 , while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complex I, III, and IV PCGs. Likewise, in Scyllaridae species inhabiting depths with low-oxygen levels, RELAX indicated relaxed selection strength in 6 of the 13 PCGs, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complexes I, III, IV, and V. The newly assembled mitochondrial genomes of P. echinatus and P. interruptus represent new genomic resources to aid with the conservation and management of lobsters targeted by major fisheries and contribute to our understanding of how environmental conditions drive adaptive evolution in spiny and slipper lobster mitochondrial PCGs.</description>

      <title>Diverse Transient Chiral Dynamics in Evolutionary distinct
  Photosynthetic Reaction Centers</title>

                The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic bacteria to oxygenic cyanobacteria and plants reflects their structural and functional adaptation to environmental conditions. Chirality plays a significant role in influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules in these RCs. This study investigates chirality-related energy transfer in two distinct RCs: Thermochromatium tepidum (BRC) and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (PSII RC) using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). Circularly polarized laser pulses reveal transient chiral dynamics, with 2DCD spectroscopy highlighting chiral contributions. BRC displays more complex chiral behavior, while PSII RC shows faster coherence decay, possibly as an adaptation to oxidative stress. Comparing the chiral dynamics of BRC and PSII RC provides insights into photosynthetic protein evolution and function.</description>

      <title>3-Electrode Setup for the Operando Detection of Side Reactions in Li-Ion Batteries: The Quantification of Released Lattice Oxygen and Transition Metal Ions from NCA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad8038</link>
      <description>Lennart Reuter, Leonhard Reinschl&#252;ssel, Hubert A. Gasteiger, Journal of The Electrochemical Society. 171(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403503541

                Detecting parasitic side reactions is paramount for developing stable cathode active materials (CAMs) for Li-ion batteries. This study presents a method for the quantification of released lattice oxygen and transition metal ions (TM II+ ions). It is based on a 3-electrode cell design employing a Vulcan carbon-based sense electrode (SE) that is held at a controlled voltage against a partially delithiated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) counter electrode (CE). At this SE, reductive currents can be measured while polarizing a CAM working electrode (WE), here a LiNi 0.80 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 (NCA), against the same LFP CE. In voltammetric scans, we show how the SE potential can be selected to specifically detect a given side reaction during CAM charge/discharge, allowing, e.g., to discriminate between lattice oxygen and dissolved TMs. Furthermore, it is shown via online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) that O 2 reduction in the here-used LP47 electrolyte consumes &#8764;2.3 electrons/O 2 . Using this value, the lattice oxygen release deduced from the 3-electrode setup upon charging of the NCA WE is in good agreement with OEMS measurements up to NCA potentials &gt;4.65 V Li . At higher potentials, the contributions from the reduction of TM II+ ions can be quantified by comparing the integrated SE current with the O 2 evolution from OEMS.</description>

      <title>Haemoglobin Gene Repertoire in Teleost and Cichlid Fishes Shaped by Gene Duplications and Genome Rearrangements</title>

                ABSTRACT Haemoglobin is a key molecule for oxygen transport in vertebrates. It exhibits remarkable gene diversity in teleost fishes, reflecting adaptation to various aquatic environments. In this study, we present the dynamic evolution of haemoglobin subunit genes based on a comparison of high&#8208;quality genome assemblies of 24 vertebrate species, including 17 teleosts (of which six are cichlids). Our findings indicate that teleost genomes contain a range of haemoglobin genes, from as few as five in fugu to as many as 43 in salmon, with the latter being the largest repertoire found in vertebrates. We find evidence that the teleost ancestor had at least four Hb&#945; and three or four Hb&#946; subunit genes, and that the current gene diversity emerged during teleost radiation, driven primarily by (tandem) gene duplications, genome compaction, and rearrangement dynamics. We provide insights into the genomic organisation of haemoglobin clusters in different teleost species. We further show that the evolution of paralogous rhbdf1 genes flanking both teleost clusters (LA and MN) supports the hypothesis for the origin of the LA cluster by rearrangement within teleosts, rather than by the teleost specific whole&#8208;genome duplication. We specifically focus on cichlid fishes, where adaptation to low oxygen environment plays role in species diversification. Our analysis of six cichlid genomes, including Pungu maclareni from the Barombi Mbo crater lake, for which we sequenced a representative genome, reveals 18&#8211;32 copies of the Hb genes, and elevated rates of non&#8208;synonymous substitutions compared to other teleosts. Overall, this work facilitates a deeper understanding of how haemoglobin genes contribute to the adaptive potential of teleosts.</description>

                Abstract Background COVID-19 remains a major public health concern, with continued resurgences of cases and substantial risk of mortality for hospitalized patients. Remdesivir has become standard-of-care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Given the continued evolution of the disease, clinical management relies on evidence from the current endemic period. Methods Using the PINC AI Healthcare database, effectiveness of remdesivir was evaluated among adults hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between December 2021 and February 2024. Three cohorts were analysed: adults, elderly (&#8805;65 years), and those with documented COVID-19 pneumonia. Analyses were stratified by oxygen requirements. Patients receiving remdesivir were matched to those not receiving remdesivir using propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine in-hospital mortality. Results 169,965 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 were included, of which 94,129 (55.4%) initiated remdesivir in the first two days of hospitalization. Remdesivir was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate as compared to no remdesivir among patients with no supplemental oxygen charges (NSOc) (aHR [95% CI]: 14-day, 0.75 [0.69-0.82]; 28-day, 0.77 [0.72-0.83]) and among those with supplemental oxygen charges (SOc): 14-day, 0.76 [0.72-0.81]; 28-day, 0.79 [0.74-0.83]) (p&amp;lt;0.0001, for all). Similar findings were observed for elderly patients and those hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusions This evidence builds on learnings from randomized controlled trials from the pandemic era to inform clinical practices. Remdesivir was associated with significant reduction in mortality for hospitalized patients including the elderly and those with COVID-19 pneumonia.</description>

                Solar saline water splitting is a promising approach to sustainable hydrogen production, harnessing abundant solar energy and the availability of brine resources, especially in the Atacama Desert. Bischofite salt (MgCl2&#183;6H2O) has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications. Efficient hydrogen production in arid or hyper arid locations using bischofite solutions is a novel and revolutionary idea. This work studied the electrochemical performance of Mn2O3 electrodes using a superposition model based on mixed potential theory and evaluated the superficial performance of this electrode in contact with a 0.5 M bischofite salt solution focusing on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that occur during saline water splitting. The application of the non-linear superposition model provides valuable electrochemical kinetic parameters that complement the understanding of Mn2O3, this being one of the novelties of this work.</description>

                Stars presently identified in the bulge spheroid are probably very old, and their abundances can be interpreted as due to the fast chemical enrichment of the early Galactic bulge. The abundances of the iron-peak elements are important tracers of nucleosynthesis processes, in particular oxygen burning, silicon burning, the weak $s$-process, and alpha -rich freeze-out. The aim of this work is to derive the abundances of V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in 58 bulge spheroid stars and to compare them with the results of a previous analysis of data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We selected the best lines for V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu located within the H -band of the spectrum, identifying the most suitable ones for abundance determination, and discarding severe blends. Using the stellar physical parameters available for our sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project, we derived the individual abundances through spectrum synthesis. We then complemented these measurements with similar results from different bulge field and globular cluster stars, in order to define the trends of the individual elements and compare with the results of chemical-evolution models. We verify that the H -band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with others from high-resolution spectroscopy of bulge stars, indicate that: V, Cr, and Ni vary in lockstep with Fe; Co tends to vary in lockstep with Fe, but could be showing a slight decrease with decreasing metallicity; and Mn and Cu decrease with decreasing metallicity. These behaviours are well reproduced by chemical-evolution models that adopt literature yields, except for Cu, which appears to drop faster than the models predict for Fe/H $&lt;$$-$0.8. Finally, abundance indicators combined with kinematical and dynamical criteria appear to show that our 58 sample stars are likely to have originated in situ.</description>

      <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode Design Through Oriented ZnO(002) Facets</title>

                Abstract The practical implementation of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries presents formidable hurdles, including uncontrolled dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced side reactions, suboptimal Zn metal utilization, and intricate Zn anode manufacturing. Here, large&#8208;scale construction of a highly oriented ZnO(002) lattice plane on Zn anode (ZnO(002)@Zn) with thermodynamic inertia and kinetic zincophilicity is designed to address such problems. Both theoretical calculations and experiment results elucidate that the ZnO(002)@Zn possesses high Zn chemical affinity, hydrogen evolution reaction suppression, and dendrite&#8208;free deposition ability due to the abundant lattice oxygen species in ZnO(002) and its low lattice mismatch with Zn(002). These features synergistically promote ion transport and enable homogeneous Zn deposition. Consequently, the ZnO(002)@Zn anode displays a stable and prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 500 h even under a larger depth of discharge (85.6%) and realizes an impressive average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, its efficacy is also evident in V 2 O 5 &#8208;cathode coin cells and pouch cells with not only high discharge capacity but also exceptional cycling stability. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with Zn metal anodes, thereby advancing the prospects of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery technologies.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Mechanism of Oxidative Potential Increase in Atmospheric Particulate Matter during Photoaging: Important Role of Aromatic Nitrogenous Compounds</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c03199</link>
      <description>Qingwen Wang, Qingcai Chen, Hao Lin, Jiale Ding, Tong Sha, Yuemei Han, Environmental Science &amp; Technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403633329

                Particulate matter (PM) undergoing various aging processes in the atmosphere changes its toxicity. However, the mechanism of toxicity evolution is not fully clarified currently. This study demonstrates that photoaging promotes an increase in the oxidative potential (OP) of atmospheric PM by about 30%, and the increased OP is mainly attributed to the production of secondary organic compounds, while water-soluble metal ions contribute only 11%. The OP of nonextractable matters (NEMs) of atmospheric PM was mostly increased after photoaging, followed by water-soluble matters (WSMs). NEM can produce quinone-like functional groups and secondary persistent free radicals during photoaging, which are most likely to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). For WSM, the conversion of low-oxidation humic-like substances (HULIS) to high-oxidation HULIS is the main reason for the increase in OP. Quinones, nitrophenols, and N-containing heterocycles are the OP contributors produced during the conversion process. Among them, quinones are the main secondary oxidizing active compounds, while nitro-phenolic compounds and N-containing heterocyclic compounds may play a catalyst-like role, facilitating the production of oxidizing active compounds and ROS in the newly converted high-oxidation HULIS. This study clarifies the secondary OP generation mechanism and provides new insights into the uncertainty of PM toxicity during atmospheric aging.</description>

      <title>Giant Dynamical Paramagnetism in the driven pseudogap phase of $ \rm
  YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x}$</title>

                In the past decade, photo-induced superconducting-like behaviors have been reported in a number of materials driven by intense pump fields. Of particular interest is the high-$T_c$ cuprate $\rm Y Ba_2 Cu_2 O_{6+x}$, where such effect has been reported up to the so-called pseudogap temperature $T^* \sim 300-400$ K. In a recent tour-de-force experiment, a transient magnetic field which is proportional to and in the same direction of an applied field has been observed outside the sample, suggestive of flux exclusion due to the Meissner effect. In this paper, we point out that the transient magnetic field could be explained by a model of bilayers of copper-oxygen planes with a local superconducting phase variable persisting up to the pseudo-gap temperature at equilibrium. Under pumping, the time evolution is described by a driven sine-Gordon equation. In the presence of an external magnetic field, this model exhibits a novel instability which amplifies the current at the edges of the bilayer formed by defects or grain boundaries, producing a giant paramagnetic magnetization in the same direction as the applied field. We present how this scenario can fit most of the available data and propose additional experimental tests which can distinguish our proposal from the Meissner flux exclusion scenario. To the extent that this model can account for the data, we conclude that the experiments have the important consequence of revealing the presence of local pairing in the pseudogap phase. More broadly, this work provides a new mechanism for amplifying external magnetic fields at ultra-fast time scales.</description>

      <title>Restructuring the interfacial active sites to generalize the volcano curves for platinum-cobalt synergistic catalysis</title>

                Computationally derived volcano curve has become the gold standard in catalysis, whose practical application usually relies on empirical interpretations of composition or size effects by the identical active site assumption. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study on disclosing both the support- and adsorbate-induced restructuring of Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts, and the related interplays among different interfacial sites to propose the synergy-dependent volcano curves. Multiple characterizations, isotopic kinetic investigations, and multiscale simulations unravel that the progressive incorporation of Co into Pt catalysts, driven by strong Pt-C bonding (metal-support interfaces) and Co-O bonding (metal-adsorbate interfaces), initiates the formation of Pt-rich alloys accompanied by isolated Co species, then Co segregation to epitaxial CoOx overlayers and adjacent Co3O4 clusters, and ultimately structural collapse into amorphous alloys. Accordingly, three distinct synergies, involving lattice oxygen redox from Pt-Co alloy/Co3O4 clusters, dual-active sites engineering via Pt-rich alloy/CoOx overlayer, and electron coupling within exposed alloy, are identified and quantified for CO oxidation (gas-phase), ammonia borane hydrolysis (liquid-phase), and hydrogen evolution reaction (electrocatalysis), respectively. The resultant synergy-dependent volcano curves represent an advancement over traditional composition-/size-dependent ones, serving as a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in bimetallic catalysis. Volcano curves have become the gold standard in catalyst design. Here, the authors propose synergy-dependent volcano curves by disclosing both support- and adsorbate-induced catalyst restructuring, ideally bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Core Formation of Earth-like Planets: Insights from Metal&#8211;Silicate Partitioning of Siderophile and Volatile Elements</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences14110281</link>
      <description>Dominik Loroch, S. Hackler, Arno Rohrbach, Jasper Berndt, Stephan Klemme, Geosciences. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403646963

                The origin of volatile elements, the timing of their accretion and their distribution during Earth&#8217;s differentiation are fundamental aspects of Earth&#8217;s early evolution. Here, we present the result of a newly developed accretion and core formation model, which features the results of high P&#8211;T metal&#8211;silicate partitioning experiments. The model includes well-studied reference elements (Fe, Ni, Ca, Al, Mg, Si) as well as trace elements (V, Ga, Ag, Au, S) covering a wide range from refractory to volatile behavior. The accretion model simulates the different steps of planet formation, such as the effects of continuous, heterogenous core formation at high P&#8211;T, the effect of the Moon-forming giant impact and the addition of matter after the core formation was completed, the so-called &#8220;late veneer&#8221;. To explore the &#8220;core formation signature&#8221; of the volatile depletion patterns and the quantitative influence of a late veneer, we modeled planets that would have formed from known materials, such as CI, CM, CV, CO, EH and EL meteorites, and from a hypothetical volatile depleted material, CI*. Some of the resulting planets are Earth-like in key properties, such as overall core size, major element composition, oxygen fugacity and trace element composition. The model predicts the chemical signatures of the main planetary reservoirs, the metallic core and bulk silicate planet (BSP) of the modeled planets, which we compare with the chemical signature of Earth derived previously from core formation models and mass balance-based approaches. We show that planets accreted from volatile depleted carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CV, CO and CI*) are closest in terms of major element (Si, Mg, Fe, Ca, Al, Ni) and also siderophile volatile element (Ge, Ga, Au) concentrations to the components from which Earth accreted. Chalcophile volatile elements (S, Ag), instead, require an additional process to lower their concentrations in the BSP to Earth-like concentrations, perhaps the late segregation of a sulfide melt.</description>
