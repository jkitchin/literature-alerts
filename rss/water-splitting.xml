      <description>Wenwen Chi, Yuming Dong, Bing Liu, Chengsi Pan, Jia&#8208;Wei Zhang, Hui Zhao, Yongfa Zhu, Zeyu Liu, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399919213

                Abstract Circumventing the conventional two-electron oxygen reduction pathway remains a great problem in enhancing the efficiency of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis. A promising approach to achieve outstanding photocatalytic activity involves the utilization of redox intermediates. Here, we engineer a polyimide aerogel photocatalyst with photoreductive carbonyl groups for non-sacrificial H 2 O 2 production. Under photoexcitation, carbonyl groups on the photocatalyst surface are reduced, forming an anion radical intermediate. The produced intermediate is oxidized by O 2 to produce H 2 O 2 and subsequently restores the carbonyl group. The high catalytic efficiency is ascribed to a photocatalytic redox cycle mediated by the radical anion, which not only promotes oxygen adsorption but also lowers the energy barrier of O 2 reduction reaction for H 2 O 2 generation. An apparent quantum yield of 14.28% at 420 &#177; 10 nm with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.92% is achieved. Moreover, we demonstrate that a mere 0.5 m 2 self-supported polyimide aerogel exposed to natural sunlight for 6 h yields significant H 2 O 2 production of 34.3 mmol m &#8722;2 .</description>

                Abstract Renewable energy&#8208;driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero&#8208;emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir&#8208;based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure&#8208;performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core&#8208;shell, single&#8208;atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effect to unlock the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction in spinel LiMn2O4 via d-block metal substitution</title>

                An effective strategy using d-block metal hybridization was proposed to induce electronic interaction and promote the synergistic effect, aiming to enhance the OER performance of cost-effective spinel LiMn2O4. Indeed, we deploy a series of LiNixMn2-xO4 catalysts substituted with Ni, yielding the increase of Mn valence states from Mn3.5+ to Mn4+. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 catalyst achieved an excellent OER performance in alkaline media, with an overpotential reduction more than 320 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared to the unsubstituted LiMn2O4, as well as the electrochemical stability. It was shown to be superior to most reported Mn-based oxide OER electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that Ni dopes holes in the Mn site, leading to an increase in Mn4+, and that the shared covalent network of Ni 3d-O 2p-Mn 3d optimized an easier desorption of intermediates. These results pave a new example for modulating the chemisorption strength, thus enabling activating the activity and stability of the OER process for cost-effective electrocatalysts based on spinel Mn oxides.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Perovskite Oxides as a Family of Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Selective Nitrogen Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c02231</link>
      <description>Hui Zheng, Yunxia Liu, Zhuang Ma, Elke Debroye, Jinyu Ye, Longsheng Zhang, Tianxi Liu, ACS nano. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399957749

                Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) can convert nitrogen (N2) into nitrate (NO3&#8211;) under ambient conditions, providing an attractive approach for synthesis of NO3&#8211;, alternative to the current approach involving the harsh Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald oxidation processes that necessitate high temperature, high pressure, and substantial carbon emission. Developing efficient NOR catalysts is a prerequisite, which remains a formidable challenge, owing to the weak activation/dissociation of N2. A variety of NOR electrocatalysts have been developed, but their NOR kinetics are still extremely sluggish, resulting in inferior Faradaic Efficiencies. Here, we report a high-entropy Ru-based perovskite oxide (denoted as Ru-HEP) that can function as a high-performance NOR catalyst and exhibit a high NO3&#8211; yield rate of 39.0 &#956;mol mg&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with a Faradaic Efficiency of 32.8%. Both our experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that the high-entropy configuration of Ru-HEP perovskite oxide can markedly enhance the oxygen-vacancy concentration, where the Ru sites and their neighboring oxygen vacancies can serve as unsaturated centers and decrease the overall energy barrier for N2 electrooxidation, thereby leading to promoted NOR kinetics. This work presents an alternative avenue for promoting NOR catalysis on perovskite oxides through the high-entropy engineering strategy.</description>

      <description>Qingmian Chen, Xiang Xiao, Peng Yan, Shaoyang Liu, Bioresource technology. 406(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399980663

                Hydrogen production through the metabolic bypass of microalgae photosynthesis is an environmentally friendly method. This review examines the genetic differences in hydrogen production between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microalgae. Additionally, the pathways for enhancing microalgae-based photosynthetic hydrogen generation are summarized. The main strategies for enhancing microalgal hydrogen production involve inhibiting the oxygen-generating process of photosynthesis and promoting the oxygen tolerance of hydrogenase. Future research is needed to explore the regulation of physiological metabolism through quorum sensing in microalgae to enhance photosynthetic hydrogen production. Moreover, effective evaluation of carbon emissions and sequestration across the entire photosynthetic hydrogen production process is crucial for determining the sustainability of microalgae-based production approaches through comprehensive lifecycle assessment. This review elucidates the prospects and challenges associated with photosynthetic hydrogen production by microalgae.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure tailoring of CuCo2O4 for boosting oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128552</link>
      <description>Qi Dong, Bo Wen, Xin Zhao, Peiyi Wang, Xiao Lyu, Separation and purification technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399981927

                Electronic structure tuning in metal oxides is a facile and effective strategy on boosting their catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Here, we demonstrate the electronic structure tuning of CuCo2O4 by phosphorus (P) doping via in-situ diffusion method. The results suggest that due to more electrons transferred from P to the neighboring Co3+, the tuned Co is served as catalytic active sites for the enhanced OER performance. The synthesized P3.85-CCO/NF exhibits an overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and a Tafel slope of 27 mV dec&#8722;1, which performs an enhanced OER activity than that of IrO2/NF. Moreover, the P3.85-CCO/NF presents stable electrochemical performances upon long-time running for 30 h. Thus, the electronic structure tuning strategy by in-situ P diffusion method emerges as an effective approach on enhancing the catalytic OER performance for metal oxide electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The fabrication of nanostructured protein-inorganic hybrid materials is crucial for the development of advanced multifunctional materials. Protein-inorganic mesoporous composites are gaining attention due to their remarkable properties, including large surface areas and active surface functional groups. We have successfully synthesized mesoporous BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 catalysts to improve the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrocatalytic water splitting for sustainable energy generation. This approach utilizes BSA in the synthesis process and is environmentally friendly. By adjusting the BSA quantity, we could control the yield of BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 mesoporous. We employed various techniques, including FE-SEM, XRD, and FTIR, to analyze the morphology and structural characteristics of the biogenic BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 electrocatalyst. Our comprehensive evaluation of the electrocatalytic OER activity of the BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 hybrid structure demonstrated its remarkable performance. The biologically synthesized catalyst exhibited exceptional OER efficiency, maintaining a high current density of 10 mA cm-2 at very low overpotentials (only 224 mV) under alkaline conditions. The elongated peptide backbone of BSA significantly facilitated ion and electron transport, contributing to improved OER activity. The synergistic interaction between various amino acids from BSA and the metal ions within Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 can be attributed to this enhancement, highlighting the potential of this hybrid structure in electrocatalytic OER applications.</description>

                Abstract The development of efficient, low-cost water splitting electrocatalysts is needed to store energy by generating sustainable hydrogen from low power clean but intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind. Here, we report a highly sustained low overpotential for oxygen evolution reached by the unique combination of three metals (NiCoV) prepared from a simple low temperature auto-combustion process. The amorphous multimetal oxygen evolving catalyst could be stably coated on a stainless-steel support using a tribochemical particle blasting method to create an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode with a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec &#8722;1 . In addition to their low overpotential, this oxygen evolving electrocatalyst preserved performance demonstrating a stability after 10 h at the technologically relevant current density and without any surface morphology alteration. Given the importance of sustainable hydrogen production, the development of this new OER catalyst points the way to removing a key technical bottleneck for the water splitting reaction and could offer a route to cost reduction and lowering hurdles to more widespread adaptation of electrolyser technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural Evolution Behaviors of Ligand&#8208;Defect&#8208;Rich Ferrocene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution via Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202400875</link>
      <description>Fengzhan Sun, Ling Zhao, Hao Xu, Yang Fu, Hui Li, Yingying Yao, Li Ren, Xiaoyun He, Yinghui Li, Rui Yang, Nian Zhang, Zhigang Hu, Tianyi Ma, Jianxin Zou, Advanced energy materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400005378

                Abstract Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have exhibited encouraging catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial process for water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. Nonetheless, distinguishing the source of catalytic activity and establishing the structure&#8208;composition&#8208;property relationships of MOFs during OER processes remain challenging. Here, for the first time, operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to monitor the structural evolution and identify the active components of ferrocene&#8208;based MOFs (Ni&#8208;Fc) for OER. Ligand&#8208;defect&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;Fc is synthesized via the co&#8208;deposition method. After electrochemical activation, Ni&#8208;Fc exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity (228 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 0.1 m KOH), which is highly competitive compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Operando XAS analysis and ex&#8208;situ characterizations reveal the structural reconstruction of Ni&#8208;Fc into amorphous NiFe&#8208;catalysts (a&#8208;NiFe) during the activation process, and further into real catalytic phases (a&#8208;NiFe&#8208;C) under catalytic potential greater than 1.45 V (vs RHE). In catalytic phases, in&#8208;situ formed deprotonated and oxygen&#8208;defected Ni oxyhydroxide analogues act as catalytic sites, while Fe hydroxide analogues derived from ligands optimize the electronic structure of Ni sites for improving OER activity. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis indicates a reduced energy barrier in a&#8208;NiFe&#8208;C compared to pristine MOFs, supporting the improved catalytic activity of the latter.</description>

      <title>Enthralling Anodic Protection by Molybdate on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst for Sustainable Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402720</link>

                Abstract Efficient and sustainable seawater electrolysis is still limited due to the interference of chloride corrosion at the anode. The designing of suitable electrocatalysts is one of the crucial ways to boost electrocatalytic activity. However, the approach may fall short as achieving high current density often occurs in chlorine evolution reaction (CER)&#8208;dominating potential regions. Thereby, apart from developing an OER&#8208;active high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based electrocatalyst, the present study also offers a unique way to protect anode surface under high current density or potential by using MoO 4 2&#8212; as an effective inhibitor during seawater oxidation. The wide variation of d &#8208;band center of high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based electrocatalyst allows great oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proficiency exhibiting an overpotential of 230 mV at current density of 20 mA cm &#8722;2 . Besides, the electrocatalyst demonstrates impressive stability over 500 h at high current density of 1 A cm &#8722;2 or at a high oxidation potential of 2.0 V versus RHE in the presence of a molybdate inhibitor. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal MoO 4 2&#8208; electrostatically accumulated at anode surface due to higher adsorption ability, thereby creating a protective layer against chlorides without affecting OER.</description>

      <title>Toward Rational Design of Mononuclear Nickel Complexes as Water Oxidation Catalysts Exploring the Ligand Effects on the Rate&#8208;Determining Step</title>

                The major impediment in realizing a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen fuel economy is the cost and inadequacy of contemporary electrochemical water splitting approaches towards the energy intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The O&#8208;O bond formation in the water oxidation half&#8208;cell reaction is both kinetically and thermodynamically challenging and amplifies the overpotential requirement in most of the active water oxidation catalysts. Herein, density functional theory is employed to interrogate 20 Ni(II) complexes, out of which 17 are in silico designed molecular water oxidation catalysts, coordinated to electron&#8208;rich tetra&#8208;anionic redox non&#8208;innocent phenylenebis(oxamidate) and dibenzo&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;2,3,8,9&#8208;tetraone parent ligands and their structural analogues, and identify the role of substituent changes or ligand effects in the order of their reactivity. Importantly, our computational mechanistic analyses predict that the activation free energy of the rate&#8208;determining O&#8208;O bond formation step obeys an inverse scaling relationship with the global electrophilicity index of the intermediate generated on two&#8208;electron oxidation of the starting complex. Additionally, the driving force is directly correlated with this OER descriptor which enables two&#8208;dimensional volcano representation and thereby extrapolation towards the ideal substitution with the chosen ligand. Our study, therefore, establish fundamental insights to overcome the imperative overpotential issue with simple and precise computational rationalization preceding experimental validation.</description>

                Abstract Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

      <title>Reinforcing built-in electric field via weakening metal&#8211;oxygen covalency within MOFs-based heterointerface for robust oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153464</link>

                Achieving enhanced built-in electric field (BEF) is highly desirable for accelerating charge transfer and boosting catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but still remains a huge challenge. Herein, we constructed the heterointerface composed of FeCo2S4 and CoFe-MOF with abundant oxygen vacancies on Ni foam substrate (named as FeCo2S4@Ov-CoFe-MOF/NF). Experimental and theoretical findings proposed that the introduction of abundant oxygen vacancies into the heterointerface could increase the energy level difference of the two components and reduce electron clouds overlap between metal Co/Fe and oxygen for increased BEF. Such enhanced BEF could accelerate the electronic migration for optimizing the d-band center and adsorption/desorption capacity of reaction intermediates. As expected, the target FeCo2S4@Ov-CoFe-MOF/NF with high BEF intensity displayed splendid OER activity and durability in the alkaline and neutral medium. The present work provides precise guidance for designing other advanced catalysts through deliberately manipulating the BEF.</description>

      <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Mechanochemical Synthesis of Bifunctional Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

      <description>M. Garc&#237;a-Rodr&#237;guez, D. Cazorla&#8208;Amor&#243;s, Emilia Morall&#243;n, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400018827

                The development of green and environmentally friendly synthesis methods of electrocatalysts is a crucial aspect in decarbonizing energy generation. In this study, eco&#8208;friendly mechanochemical synthesis of perovskite metal oxide&#8208;carbon black composites is proposed using different conditions and additives such as KOH. Furthermore, the optimization of ball milling conditions, including time and rotational speed, is studied. The mechanochemical synthesis in solid&#8208;state conditions without additives produces electrocatalysts that exhibit the highest bifunctional electrochemical activity towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, this synthesis demonstrates a lower Environmental Impact Factor (E&#8208;factor), indicating its greener nature, and due to its simplicity, it has a great potential for scalability. The obtained bifunctional electrocatalysts have been tested in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) for 22 h with similar performance compared to the commercial catalyst (Pt/C) at significantly lower cost. These promising findings are attributed to the enhanced interaction between the perovskite metal oxide and carbon material and the improved dispersion of the perovskite metal oxide on the carbon materials.</description>

                This study employed an electrodeposition approach to synthesize multiphasic CuSx and FeSx on nickel foam (NF) for application in saline water splitting. This multiphasic electrocatalyst exhibits a cauliflower morphology and develops a porous fused-type morphology upon partial oxidation. The NF/CuSx/FeSx electrode with partial oxidation exhibits the lowest overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 163 mV/decade for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential of 73 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 165 mV/decade were found for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A charge transfer coefficient value of ~0.5 in OER and HER indicates that the rate-determining step depends on the surface adsorption of reaction species. The presence of an unpaired electron during partial oxidation can create additional active sites and reduce solution resistance (Rs). This can improve the interaction between reactants and intermediates, improving OER and HER performance. NF/CuSx/FeSx composites demonstrated robust stability using real seawater splitting over 80 hours in HER with negligible degradation. However, catalyst breakdown in OER after 10 hours due to prolonged exposure to higher potentials, resulting in oxidative corrosion. This study offers a multiphasic electrode design using the electrodeposition technique to produce green hydrogen energy through seawater splitting.</description>

                Developing a non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting is desirable for renewable energy systems. We developed a novel method to fabricate a heterostructured electrocatalyst, comprising a NiCoP nanoneedle array grown on Ti3C2Tx MXene-coated Ni foam (NCP-MX/NF) using a dip-coating hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization. Due to the abundance of active sites, enhanced electronic kinetics, and sufficient electrolyte accessibility resulting from the synergistic effects of NCP and MXene, NCP-MX/NF bifunctional alkaline catalysts afford superb electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (72 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for HER and 303 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER), a low Tafel slope (49.2 mV dec&#8211;1 for HER and 69.5 mV dec&#8211;1 for OER), and long-term stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting performance of NCP-MX/NF, which requires potentials as low as 1.54 and 1.76 V at a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, exceeded the performance of the Pt/C&#8741;IrO2 couple in terms of overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the NCP/Ti3C2O2 interface model predicted the catalytic contribution to interfacial formation by analyzing the electronic redistribution at the interface. This contribution was also evaluated by calculating the adsorption energetics of the descriptor molecules (H2O and the H and OER intermediates).</description>

                Abstract Suppressing the kinetically favorable lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism pathway and triggering the adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway at the expense of activity are the state-of-the-art strategies for Ru-based electrocatalysts toward acidic water oxidation. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru species are anchored into an acidic stable vinyl-linked 2D covalent organic framework with unique crossed &#960;-conjugation, termed as COF-205-Ru. The crossed &#960;-conjugated structure of COF-205-Ru not only suppresses the dissolution of Ru through strong Ru-N motifs, but also reduces the oxidation state of Ru by multiple &#960;-conjugations, thereby activating the oxygen coordinated to Ru and stabilizing the oxygen vacancies during oxygen evolution process. Experimental results including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ powder X-ray diffraction patterns, and theoretical calculations unveil the activated oxygen with elevated energy level of O 2 p band, decreased oxygen vacancy formation energy, promoted electrochemical stability, and significantly reduced energy barrier of potential determining step for acidic water oxidation. Consequently, the obtained COF-205-Ru displays a high mass activity with 2659.3 A g &#8722;1 , which is 32-fold higher than the commercial RuO 2 , and retains long-term durability of over 280 h. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously promote the stability and activity of Ru-based catalysts for acidic water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt (Co)-based oxides show promising activity as precious metal-free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but the dissolution of Co has limited the durability of Co3O4 at industrially relevant current densities. This work demonstrates that cation in an octahedral coordination environment accounts for the oxygen evolution activity. Using a mixed inverse-normal phase spinel CoxGa(3-x)O4 as a proof-of-concept example, the designed Co2+-O-Co3+ motifs in octahedral sites trigger oxygen evolution through a kinetically favorable radical coupling pathway. Furthermore, lattice oxygen exchange, a leading factor in catalyst structural degradation for normal Co3O4, is suppressed, as evidenced by isotopic labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. With the optimized catalyst, Co1.8Ga1.2O4, we report an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm2, stable operation at 200 mA/cm2 for 200 hours in a three-electrode setup, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer operating at 200 mA/cm2 for 450 hours.</description>

                Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly energy source that can be extracted from water through electrolysis. However, the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side is the main obstacle to the widespread use of water-splitting devices. This study used self-developed highly porous nickel structures (SMNF) and commercial nickel foam (CNF) as working electrodes in the electrolysis process. Iron (II, III) Oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) as a catalyst is coated with a dip coating technique on the Ni porous structure and then calcined using a laser process to produce a Ni-Fe 3 O 4 -based electrode. Electrochemical test results show that the presence of Fe 3 O 4 significantly impacts high reaction kinetics. The SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 demonstrated an overpotential of 217,3 mV at 1 M KOH electrolyte, at a current density of 10 mA, lower to SMNF electrode without Fe 3 O 4 with an overpotential of 361,4 mV under the same conditions. In addition, the difference in porosity less significantly affects the electrode's effectiveness due to the slight difference in mass loading, which is only &lt; 5 mg. However, electro-impedance spectroscopy (EIS) testing shows better performance on SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 with a smaller electrical series resistance (ESR), around 0.638 &#937;, compared to CNF-Fe 3 O 4 , which is 0.767 &#937;. Overall, observations by chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 155 mV at 5 hrs show stable performance of SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 electrodes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long&#8208;Term Performance of Sulfides in Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Sulfate Ion&#8208;Assisted Strategy</title>

                Abstract Transition metal sulfides (TMS) exhibit significant promise as non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments, notwithstanding their susceptibility to long&#8208;term instability due to the gradual leaching of surface&#8208;reconstructed sulfate ions (SO 4 2&#8722; ). In this study, a sulfate ion&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to stabilize the surface&#8208;reconstructed SO 4 2&#8722; of FeNiS 2 . The findings reveal that SO 4 2&#8722; experiences considerable loss in KOH due to the infinite concentration gradient of SO 4 2&#8722; on the surface. Conversely, in K 2 SO 4 /KOH, this strategy mitigates rapid leaching and preserves the predominant surface&#8208;reconstructed SO 4 2&#8722; , thereby enhancing stability in both accelerated degradation (5000 cycles) and long&#8208;term (&#8805;120 h) tests, with &#8776;95% current density retained. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of SO 4 2&#8722; proves to be crucial, as supported by both experimental and theoretical results. This approach offers insights into bolstering the long&#8208;term OER stability of TMS and similar compounds, thereby advancing the prospects for widespread application in electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

                Designing and developing suitable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and stability remain challenging in electrolytic water splitting. Hence, NiFe@NC@MoS2 core-bishell composites wrapped by molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NC) were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis in this research. NiFe@NC@MoS2 composite exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 288mV and a Tafel slope of 53.2 mV&#183;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to commercial RuO2. NC and MoS2 bishells create profuse edge active sites that enhance the adsorption ability of OOH* while lowering the overall overpotential of the product and improving its oxygen precipitation performance. The density function theory(DFT) analysis confirms that the layered MoS2 in NiFe@NC@MoS2 provides additional edge active sites and enhances electron transfer, thus increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity. This research paves a novel way for developing OER electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Accumulation for a Hydrophobic Cathode in Lean-Oxygen Seawater Batteries</title>

                The unsatisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics caused by the inherent lean-oxygen marine environment brings low power density for metal-dissolved oxygen seawater batteries (SWBs). In this study, we propose a seawater/electrode interfacial engineering strategy by constructing a hydrophobic coating to realize enhanced mass transfer of dissolved oxygen for the fully immersed cathode of SWBs. Accumulation of dissolved oxygen from seawater to the catalyst is particularly beneficial for improving the ORR performance under lean-oxygen conditions. As a result, SWB assembled with a hydrophobic cathode achieved a power density of up to 2.32 mW cm&#8211;2 and sustained discharge at 1.3 V for 250 h. Remarkably, even in environments with an oxygen concentration of 4 mg L&#8211;1, it can operate at a voltage approximately 100 mV higher than that of an unmodified SWB. The introduction of a hydrophobic interface enhances the discharge voltage and power of SWBs by improving interfacial oxygen mass transfer, providing new insights into improving the underwater ORR performance for practical SWBs.</description>

                Abstract To address the substantial energy needs of the quickly evolving modern civilization, efforts are still needed to provide sustainable renewable energy sources. The electrocatalytic Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the essential technologies used in the various hydrogen production techniques. ZIF&#8208;67 nanocubes (ZIF&#8208;67 NCs) were synthesized in an aqueous solution and used as sacrificial templates. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was added under water bath conditions, resulting in the evolution of numerous small layered layers of cobalt hydroxide. This ultimately led to the formation of multilayered, three&#8208;dimensionally crosslinked Co&#8208;LDH with a porous networked cubic morphology. Hydrolysis of Co 2+ at different concentrations produces different degrees of weak acidic environments, and the loose LDH on the cubic structure of the best catalyst, Co&#8208;LDH&#8208;1, exposes more active cobalt sites for the OER, which results in a high electrochemically active surface area, with an overpotential of 354 mV and a Tafel slope of 79.06 mV dec &#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and good stability and low activation under alkaline condition also has good stability and low activation energy. It provides us an easy and practical plan for logically creating ZIF&#8208;derived hydroxide materials, leading to the development of affordable and effective electrocatalysts.</description>

                Thin&#8208;film encapsulation plays an essential role in the stability of flexible displays. Although Al 2 O 3 film has good water&#8208;oxygen barrier properties, its bending performance needs to be enhanced. This paper inserts Alucone into Al 2 O 3 film to generate Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film with good barrier and bending performance to improve the encapsulated devices. The finite element analyzing approach and the calcium dot arrays test are employed to investigate the influence of structural ratio and overlapping density on the water&#8208;oxygen barrier and mechanical properties of the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film. The results show that the proportion of Alucone sublayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (with a total thickness of 60 nm) is directly proportional to the overlapping structure's ability to disperse stresses and inversely proportional to the overlapping structure's water&#8208;oxygen barrier property. When the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping structure ratio is 1:1, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film can balance the bending and barrier properties. The bending property of Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1, total thickness is 60 nm) diminishes with increasing overlapping density, and its water&#8208;oxygen barrier property increases and then drops. Combining the results of the simulation and calcium dot arrays test, it is apparent that when the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1 and the overlapping density is 5, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film has good bending and barrier performance. This is expected to promote the development of commercial flexible display technology.</description>

                Abstract Photocatalysis is a promising technique due to its capacity to efficiently harvest solar energy and its potential to address the global energy crisis. However, the structure&#8211;activity relationships of photocatalyst during wavelength-dependent photocatalytic reactions remains largely unexplored because it is difficult to measure under operating conditions. Here we show the photocatalytic strain evolution of a single Au nanoparticle (AuNP) supported on a TiO 2 film by combining three-dimensional (3D) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging with an external light source. The wavelength-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has significant effects on the structural deformation of the AuNP, leading to its strain evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to rationalize the induced strain caused by the adsorption of ROS on the AuNP surface. These observations provide insights of how the photocatalytic activity impacts on the structural deformation of AuNP, contributing to the general understanding of the atomic-level catalytic adsorption process.</description>

                Nickel-based sulfides have been proven to be excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their excellent electrical conductivity, but their poor stability hinders their application in practical applications. To address this issue, defect engineering has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance the electronic structure of the catalyst and further boost the OER performance. Herein, a MOF-derived Sn-doped NiS/Ni3S2 nanostructure grown in situ on nickel foam (Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF) has been designed as an active OER electrocatalyst. The morphology of the material was significantly impacted by the addition of the Sn elements, nanorods modified with nanoparticles providing more active sites. Moreover, the introduction of Sn elements induced the generation of sulfur vacancies (Vs), enhanced electron transfer, promoted electron redistribution, and increased the charge transfer rate. All of these endow the Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF-T with exceptionally low overpotentials of 104 and 286 mV to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER. Moreover, the Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF-T showed long-term stability, maintaining 100 h at current densities of 100 mA cm&#8211;2. In short, this work opened a route for engineering defects to boost the OER.</description>

      <title>Recent Research on Iridium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction from the Origin of Reaction Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202403845</link>

                As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.</description>

                Chirality-induced spin selectivity observed in chiral 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite holds promise to achieve spin-dependent electrochemistry. However, conventional chiral 2D perovskites suffer from low conductivity and hygroscopicity, limiting electrochemical performance and operational stability. Here, a cutting-edge material design is introduced to develop a stable and efficient chiral perovskite-based spin polarizer by employing fluorinated chiral cation. The fluorination approach effectively promotes the charge carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction by mitigating the dielectric confinement effect within the multi-quantum well-structured 2D perovskite. Integrating the fluorinated cation incorporated spin polarizer with BiVO</description>

                Abstract Enabling a hydrogen fuel-based economy is reliant on the discovery of materials that catalyze the electrolysis of water which requires low-cost catalytic electrodes to improve the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction. Fe2.5Ni2.5Sn3, was prepared by arc-melting and electrochemical studies were conducted to evaluate its ability to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction. Potentiodynamic polarization testing revealed that the Fe2.5Ni2.5Sn3 alloy had a Tafel slope of 40 mV/decade and required an overpotential of 326 mV in order to obtain a current density of 10 mA/cm2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicated that the native oxide present on the surface became hydrated upon subjecting it to oxygen evolution studies.</description>

                To alleviate the problems of environmental pollution and energy crisis, aggressive development of clean and alternative energy technologies, in particular, water splitting, metal&#8211;air batteries, and fuel cells involving two key half reactions comprising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR), is crucial. In this work, an innovative hybrid comprising heterogeneous Cu/Co bimetallic nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed on a nitrogen-doped carbon layer (Cu/Co/NC) was constructed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and ORR via a hydrothermal reaction along with post-solid-phase sintering technique. Thanks to the interfacial coupling and electronic synergism between the Cu and Co bimetallic nanoparticles, the Cu/Co/NC catalyst showed improved catalytic ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.865 V and an excellent stability of more than 30 h, even compared to 20 wt% Pt/C. The Cu/Co/NC catalyst also exhibited excellent HER catalytic performance with an overpotential of below 149 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and long-term operation for over 30 h.</description>

                Abstract In this work, self&#8208;derivation and surface reconstruction strategies are innovatively introduced into the synthetic route of the metal complex&#8208;derived catalysts. The in situ grown nanorod arrays of Ni&#8208;based complex are prepared by a simple self&#8208;derivation and rapid ligand chelation reaction. Furthermore, highly active heterogeneous electrocatalysts are developed by mild&#8208;temperature calcination. Attributed to the maintained morphology and highly dispersed Ni/Ni(OH) 2 heterojunction active sites, the as&#8208;prepared electrode exhibits superior hydrogen evolution activity (38.4 mV&#8211;10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). In particular, the dynamic reconstruction during oxygen evolution through in situ Fourier transform infrared and in situ Raman spectroscopies are observed. The reconstructed Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH by activation gives the electrode higher oxygen evolution performance (369 mV&#8211;200 mA cm &#8722;2 ). Further density functional theory mechanism studies disclose that Ni/Ni(OH) 2 contributes to the adsorption of H* in hydrogen evolution and the activated Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH optimizes the formation of intermediates in oxygen evolution.</description>

                Recognizing the essential factor governing interfacial hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is central to electrocatalytic water-splitting. Traditional strategies aiming at enhancing electrocatalytic activities have mainly focused on manipulating active site valencies or coordination environments.

                In recent years, carbon shells have garnered attention as possible protective layers that can be applied to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to prevent corrosion under alkaline conditions. However, thermodynamic considerations and experimental results indicate that these carbon shells are subject to corrosion themselves, limiting their applicability as protective coatings against oxidation. Herein, the thermodynamics of carbon corrosion are presented with spectrometric, spectroscopic, crystallographic, microscopy, and electrochemical measurements, emphasizing the inevitable degradation of carbon under alkaline OER conditions. Recent work focused on suppressing this carbon corrosion is then discussed alongside future directions for carbon shells in water oxidation research.</description>

      <title>Insights on Water of Crystallization in Autologous Cobalt Phosphates for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>

                Cobalt phosphates are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the rate-determining step in water splitting. However, the role of water crystallization in OER electrocatalysis is not well understood, limiting the systematic design of such catalysts. This study compares Co3(PO4)2&#183;4H2O (CoPO-25) and Co3(PO4)2 (CoPO-25NW) nanoflakes to highlight the importance of water of crystallization. The results show that water of crystallization increases the oxygen vacancy concentration, enhances electrical conductivity, and modifies electronic structure, leading to higher catalytic activity for CoPO-25. Additionally, the water of crystallization sustains the structural stability of CoPO-25, preventing complete hydroxylation conversion. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the water of crystallization in CoPO-25 is crucial for modifying binding interactions between reaction intermediates and the catalyst. This study not only presents a promising electrocatalyst but also provides insights into the impact of water crystallization in cobalt phosphates on the OER.</description>

                Herein, we construct amorphous molybdenum oxide films by thermal atomic layer deposition (T&#8208;ALD) and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE&#8208;ALD). The physical and chemical properties of molybdenum oxide films prepared by the two methods were systematically compared by means of film growth law, atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope etc. The results show that the amorphous molybdenum oxide physical phase prepared by both atomic layer deposition methods is MoO 3 . Compared with T&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the growth rate of MoO 3 thin films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD is higher. Compared to PE&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the MoO 3 films prepared by T&#8208;ALD did not have nucleation delayed to a laminar growth mode, resulting in smoother deposited films and contained less impurity carbon. The MoO 3 prepared by PE&#8208;ALD contains 7.4% impurity carbon. This carbon&#8208;doped film significantly improves the conductivity of the MoO 3 film and shows good electrochemical activity. As expected, the MoO 3 films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential was only 259 mV at 10 mA cm &#8208;2 and continued to evolution oxygen for 60 h with almost no attenuation, indicating that carbon doping significantly improves the catalytic intrinsic activity and stability of MoO 3 .

                Amorphous structure shows more catalytic active sites but poor conductivity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we fabricated a novel three-dimensional (3D) self-supported NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) catalytic material with amorphous/ crystalline interface, aiming to obtain both excellent catalytic activity and conductivity. This homogeneous hierarchical structure exhibits a high catalytic activity and robustness, giving the industrially required current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at an ultralow overpotential of 359.8 mV with 240-hour stability in 1 M KOH. In-situ electrochemical tests reveal that the amorphous/crystalline interface boosts the intermediates evolution and OER kinetics, which might be ascribed to considerable active sites and fast charge transfer. Moreover, the 3D structure has unique superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity, which can further accelerate the electrolyte penetration, facilitate the bubbles desorption from the electrode, enhance mass transport, and thus improve OER performance at large current densities. This work provides a feasible way to develop high-performance electrocatalytic material via constructing homogeneous amorphous/crystalline interface.</description>

                The unsatisfactory reactive activity and structural stability in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been the main bottleneck in exploiting hydrogen energy from water splitting. Herein, we suggest a halogen (H)-doping strategy in 1T phase iridium dioxide (IrO2) monolayer to optimize its electronic structure for accelerating the reaction kinetics process, in which the bonding interaction difference between Ir-H and Ir-O bonds causes an electronic reconfiguration through asymmetric orbital hybridization. The doped F elements with a lower valence state make more valence electrons revert to the Ir-5d orbitals to reduce the activation energy, leading to a higher catalytic activity. In addition, a stronger bonding interaction at Ir-F bonds also can lead to a higher structural stability. However, this advantage cannot occur at Cl-doped or Br-doped IrO2 monolayer. This work provides a new insight into designing new-type catalysts for acidic OER.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH Heterostructures as Efficient Alkaline Water Splitting (Photo)Electrocatalysts</title>

                Designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge that needs to be resolved to enable green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two half-cell reactions of OWS. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize hierarchical het- erostructure MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low overpotentials of 178 mV and 64 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 under light assistance. The MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH&#8214;MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH OWS cell demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.46 V at 10 mA/cm2 during light-assisted water electrolysis. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping of high-valence Mo atoms within and the deposition of MoS2 quantum dots on the LDH matrix improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the elec- trocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the ther- modynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, the facile synthesis method enables the design of highly active MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Recent Development of Transition Metal&#8208;based Amorphous Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>

                Electrochemical water splitting, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a promising hydrogen production technology. However, in practice, the high overpotentials and sluggish reaction kinetics associated with the anode OER process are the major obstacles to the smooth progress of electrocatalytic water splitting. Amorphous electrocatalysts, a crucial family of functional materials, exhibit unexpected performance due to their special short&#8208;range ordered and long&#8208;range disordered atom arrangement, abundant defect sites and adjustable composition. To date, while numerous recent publications showcase promising results for transition metal&#8208;based amorphous electrocatalysts, including amorphous metal phosphide and metal hydroxide electrocatalysts with remarkable HER and OER properties respectively, the utilization of single&#8208;function HER or OER catalysts tends to augment system complexity for water electrolysis, thereby escalating the cost of hydrogen production. In this regard, amorphous HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts are desired. In this review, we summarize the recent development on transition metal&#8208;based amorphous catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. The design strategies for constructing HER/OER bifunctional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based amorphous electrocatalysts are highlighted here, also including the exploration of relationship between catalyst structures and their remarkably improved performance. Finally, the possibilities of amorphous bifunctional catalysts for practical industrial applications are evaluated and future research direction are suggested.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Key Factors Governing O2 Evolution upon Charging a Reversible LiOH-based Nonaqueous Li-O2 Battery</title>

                Abstract Achieving a highly reversible 4e&#8722;/O2 oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential yet highly challenging task for nonaqueous LiOH-based Li-O2 batteries, as the kinetically sluggish OER tend to entangle with competing parasitic reactions, whose origins unfortunately remain largely elusive. Here we construct a highly reversible LiOH-based Li-O2 battery using FeCoNi LDH catalysts and tetramethylene sulfone electrolytes. We show that the decomposition of LiOH toward O2 evolution involves the formation of *OH, *HO2&#8722; and *H2O2 species but no 1O2. The electrophilic attack of the electrolyte by *OH and the carbon corrosion by LiOH at potentials beyond 3.5 V are primary causes of the irreversibility. We demonstrate that these side reactions can be considerably suppressed by optimizing the solvent | catalyst | electrical conductor interfaces. Our work highlights key strategies for promoting reversible LiOH decomposition via the 4e&#8722;/O2 OER, paving the ways towards long-life LiOH-based nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries.</description>

                Despite the potential of heterostructure construction and surface reconstruction strategies to significantly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metal compounds, integrating these approaches into a single material system remains a significant challenge. In this work, we report an efficient CoFe-LDH catalyst with multi-metal nitrides on the surface through simple and tunable N2-plasma treatment (PL CoFe-LDH). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations indicate a high concentration of defective sites in PL CoFe-LDH, which facilitates the exposure of a greater number of active NFeO and NCoO centers. During the initial stage of the OER process, there is a rapid phase transition of Fe and Co, leading to the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxides. Meanwhile, Co3+ species gradually accumulate on the surfaces, which is responsible for the excellent OER catalytic activity. Then, the neighboring N atoms function as electron reservoirs, donating electrons to the Co sites to prevent overoxidation and dissolution of Co in the electrolyte, thus significantly enhancing the stability of the OER. The catalysts enable the achievement of ultralow OER overpotential, measuring 161.1 and 205.5 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 200 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, while exhibiting exceptional stability.</description>

                ABSTRACT Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as power generators and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) as hydrogen fuel producers play critical roles in implementing hydrogen energy. The bipolar plates (BPPs) in both PEMFC and PEMWE facilitate the distribution of reactants and products, providing electrical connectivity in a series of singular cells. Although both systems are categorized under the same PEM spectrum, the differing reaction mechanisms require specialized plate properties to achieve optimum performance. This short review analyzes the characteristics of BPPs in both PEMFC and PEMWE, with a focus on the plate material, coating, and flow field. This short review concluded that the polymer composite graphite&#8211;based BPPs are the most feasible for PEMFC with no coating needed. PEMWE needs SS316 as a BPP material with a conductive coating to withstand the highly corrosive oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. The serpentine flow field showed dominance in PEMFC stack performance due to even fluid distribution and efficient liquid water drainage. However, its high&#8208;pressure drop contributes to greater parasitic power. PEMWEs commonly adopt the parallel flow field for its lower contact resistance and bubble formation for efficient mass transport toward the cathode.</description>

                Abstract This work utilizes defect engineering, heterostructure, pyridine N&#8208;doping, and carbon supporting to enhance cobalt&#8208;nickel selenide microspheres' performance in the oxygen electrode reaction. Specifically, microspheres mainly composed of CoNiSe 2 and Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction rich in selenium vacancies (V Se&#183; ) wrapped with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC) are prepared by Ar/NH 3 radio frequency plasma etching technique. The synthesized p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC shows high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance (half&#8208;wave potential (E 1/2 ) = 0.878 V and limiting current density (J L ) = 21.88 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The J L exceeds the 20 wt% Pt/C (19.34 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and the E 1/2 is close to the 20 wt% Pt/C (0.881 V). It also possesses excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (overpotential of 324 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), which even exceeds that of the commercial RuO 2 (427 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The density functional theory calculation indicates that the enhancement of ORR performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of plasma&#8208;induced V Se&#183; and the CoNiSe 2 &#8208;Co 9 Se 8 heterojunction. The p&#8208;CoNiSe/NCNT@CC electrode assembled Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) show a peak power density of 138.29 mW cm &#8722;2 , outperforming the 20 wt% Pt/C+RuO 2 (73.9 mW cm &#8722;2 ) and other recently reported catalysts. Furthermore, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB delivers a high peak power density of 64.83 mW cm &#8722;2 and ultra&#8208;robust cycling stability even under bending.</description>

                The in situ confinement of nickel (Ni)&#8208;iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer&#8208;derived micro&#8208;/mesoporous silicon carboxynitride (Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N)&#8208;based support is investigated to stimulate superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in an alkaline media. Firstly, we consider a commercial polysilazane (PSZ) and Ni and Fe salts to be mixed together in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in order to prepare a series of Ni&#8208;Fe:organosilicon coordination complexes. The latter are then heat&#8208;treated at 500 &#176;C in flowing argon to form the title compounds. By considering a Ni:Fe ratio of 1.5, face centred cubic (fcc) NixFey alloy NPs with a size of 15&#8208;30 nm are in situ generated in a micro&#8208;/mesoporous Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N&#8208;based support displaying a specific surface area (SSA) as high as 237 m2&#8901;g&#8208;1. Hence, NPs are renderedaccessible to promote electrocatalytic water oxidation. An OER overpotential as low as 315 mV at 10 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 is measured. This high catalytic performance (considering that the metal mass loading is as low as 0.24 mg cm&#8722;2) is rather stable as observed after an activation step; thus, validating our synthesis approach and opening further investigations. This is clearly attributed to both the strong NP&#8208;matrix interaction and the confinement effect of the matrix as highlighted through post mortem microscopy observations.</description>

                Abstract Rapid synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) offers new opportunities to develop functional materials in widespread applications. Although some methods have successfully produced HEA NPs, these methods generally require rigorous conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, restricted atmosphere and limited substrates, which impede practical viability. In this work, we report a laser solid-phase synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles by laser irradiation of mixed metal precursors on a laser-induced graphene (LIG) support with a 3D porous structure. The CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles are embraced by several graphene layers, forming graphene shell-encapsulated HEA nanoparticles. We provide an in-depth understanding of the laser solid-phase synthesis of HEA NPs on LIG supports by simulation and experimental observations, in consideration of mixed metal precursor adsorption, thermal decomposition, reduction through electrons from laser-induced thermionic emission, and liquid beads splitting. The production rate reaches up to 30 g/h under the current laser setup. The laser-synthesized graphene shell-encapsulated CrMnFeCoNi NPs loaded on LIG supports are used directly as 3D binder-free integrated electrodes and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 293 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and exceptional stability over 428 hours in alkaline media, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalyst and the counterpart catalysts reported by other methods. This work also demonstrates the versatility of this technique through the successful synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi oxide, sulfide and phosphide nanoparticles.</description>

                Abstract Due to the prevailing energy shortages, the quest for new alternative energy sources is growing increasingly urgent. Hydrogen production through water electrolysis has become a crucial method. However, the slow four-electron reaction in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes the main rate-limiting step. In this study, we propose obtaining heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P after composite phosphatisation using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate material. The experimental results demonstrate that the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO exhibits an overpotential of 365mV at a current density of 10mA/cm2 , and displays a Tafel slope value of 114.02mF/dec, a bilayer capacitance of 1.853mF/cm2 for OER in a 1 M KOH solution. After phosphating, the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with only 215 mV overpotential, a Tafel slope value of 79.36 mV/dec, and a bilayer capacitance of 34.73mF/cm2 at a current density of 10mA/cm2 . Moreover, it also exhibits relatively stable performance during cyclic voltammetry testing for up to1000 cycles. Analyses suggest that the formation of a heterojunction structure in La(OH)3@CuO-P effectively addresses the issues of insufficient conductivity of La(OH)3 and tendency for CuO monomer aggregation while maintaining excellent properties for each component. The substitutional P atom doping not only adjusts the electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption free energy of -OH but also reduces sample size and increases catalytic active sites, thereby further enhancing the OER performance of the material.</description>

                Oxygenic photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all biomass production on Earth, and may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of multicellular life. Life has evolved to perform photosynthesis under a wide range of illumination conditions, but with a common basic architecture of a light-harvesting antenna system coupled to a photochemical reaction centre. Using a general thermodynamic model of energy capture and diffusion in the antennae, coupled with a genetic algorithm to model their evolution, we reproduce qualitatively the antenna structures of multiple types of oxygenic photoautotrophs, including pigment composition, the linear absorption profile and the macrostructural topology, suggesting that the same simple physical principles underlie the development of distinct light-harvesting structures in various photosynthetic organisms. We finally apply our model to extra-solar light-environments and comment on the relative viability of both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis on exoplanets orbiting other types of stars.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of Complex Organic Molecules in Turbulent
  Protoplanetary Disks: Effect of stochastic UV irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.17367</link>
      <description>Takeshi Suzuki, Kenji Furuya, Yuri Aikawa, Takashi Shibata, Liton Majumdar, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400064906

                We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 10$^6$ yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO$_2$, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH$_3$NH$_2$, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.</description>

      <title>Vacancy engineering of BiFeO3 perovskite for low-barrier electrochemical nitrogen fixation</title>

                Because of its environmental and intrinsic benefits, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using electrocatalysts has garnered significant attention. Engineering on the surface is commonly utilized to improve electrocatalytic activity by introducing atomic defects. In this study, we have developed a successful strategy to promote nitrogen activation by introducing oxygen vacancies into BiFeO3 perovskite. BiFeO3 with oxygen vacancies (denoted as VO-BiFeO3) possesses a high NH3 yield rate (89.3 &#956;g h-1 mgcat-1) and Faradaic efficiency (FE) (13.5%) at -0.40 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the introduction of oxygen vacancies increases the binding capacity for nitrogen immobilization and reduces the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of NRR. Moreover, the analysis of the thermodynamic limiting potentials towards N2 reduction and H2 evolution demonstrates that VO-BiFeO3 has a higher selectivity for NRR than pristine BiFeO3.</description>

                The Front Cover graphic illustrates the process of hydrogen evolution during water splitting through electrocatalysis, highlighting the functionality of cationically engineered bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles (NPs). In their Research Article, Astita Dubey, Ignacio Sanju&#225;n, and co-workers explain that the electrocatalytic activity of Mn-doped BFO NPs undergoes a transformative shift as a consequence of mono-, di-, and tri-valent cation substitution for hydrogen evolution. Unlocking the potential of Mn-doped BFO NPs: enhancing hydrogen evolution activity through cationic substitutions at the Bi site. A lower kinetic overpotential for codoped BFO NPs was found. Why? It&#8242;s all about reducing charge transfer resistance, boosting surface area, and introducing novel active sites through various valent dopants. With a unique morphology, varied pore sizes, and bonus features like optimum surface defects and oxygen vacancies, contribute to reducing kinetic overpotential.

                One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode planetary compositional signatures. This makes it imperative to perform a large chemical survey not only of the planets, but their host stars as well. This work is aimed at providing homogeneous chemical abundances for C, N, and O among a sample of 181 stars belonging to Tier 1 of the Ariel mission candidate sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators ( C i lines at 5052 and 5380.3 O i forbidden line at 6300.3 C _2$ bands at 5128 and 5165 and CN band at 4215 using high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra collected with a range of spectrographs. We determined carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analysed the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution and in terms of the planetary companion properties. We find that our sample essentially follows standard trends with respect to the metallicity values expected for the C/Fe N/Fe and O/Fe abundance ratios. The proportion between carbon and oxygen abundances (both yields of primary production) is consistent with a constant ratio as O/H increases. Meanwhile, the abundance of nitrogen tends to increase with the increasing of the oxygen abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The C/N C/O and N/O abundance ratios are also correlated with Fe/H which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories when host stars of different metallicities are compared. Finally, we provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched (or otherwise) with respect to the host stars.</description>

                Abstract Space micropump are an important component of the on-orbit refuelling system. The gas-liquid behaviour transition induced by dissolved and released processes in the micropump has obtained considerable attention. Our proposed mathematical model achieved the bidirectional dissolved-released processes in an on-orbit space micropump for the first time. The performance characteristics of the micropump and the mathematical computational model used by the plug-discharge flow have been validated. Herein, the correlated mechanism between the flow, mass transfer and solution status were analysed. Under the pressurization of the micropump impeller, the gas was constantly dissolved into the solution, and the higher concentration caused the gas to evolve from the solution. The oxygen increment decreased rapidly when the initial dissolved oxygen centration exceeded 23 mg/L because of the gas evolution occurred. Focused on this sudden decreasing state of oxygen increment from 23 to 24 mg/L, four concentration conditions were discussed in depth including flow field, oxygen increment and mass transfer rate. In the impeller, the equilibrium concentration increases controlled by the pressure was obviously larger than the increase of the real-time concentration; thus, the unidirectional absorbed processes occurred inside the impeller. Two near-rate mass-transfer band were found near the short blades, exhibiting the dynamic equilibrium characteristic. Moreover, affected by the strong disturbance of the impeller outlet, the mass transfer rate was the highest here.</description>

      <title>The differential collapse&#8211;filling evolution process of the paleo-underground river in the Northern Uplift of the Tarim Basin</title>

                The characteristics and stages of collapse&#8211;filling in paleo-underground rivers vary in recharge&#8211;runoff&#8211;discharge zones, constraining the associated fracture-caved reservoirs in carbonate strata. This paper comprehensively uses core, fluid inclusion, and carbon&#8211;oxygen isotope to probe the evolution process and migration of collapse&#8211;filling in paleo-underground rivers in the Northern Uplift of the Tarim Basin. The results show that 1) more than three stages of collapse&#8211;filling were identified in recharge&#8211;runoff&#8211;discharge zones, and a four-stage differential collapse&#8211;filling process was proposed to summarize the evolution of paleo-underground rivers. 2) The collapse&#8211;filling process varies spatiotemporally in the recharge, runoff, and discharge zones. Hydrodynamic strength and filling capacity migrate gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. 3) Collapse&#8211;filling mechanisms, including gravity, suffusion, and suction&#8211;erosion mechanisms, also vary along with the collapse&#8211;filling evolution process of paleo-underground rivers. The research provided a new insight to recognize and interpret the differential planar distribution and vertical filling of the paleo-underground river system, which can be further applied to investigate the fracture-caved karst reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Reversible Oxygen Redox Chemistry in High-Entropy P2-Type Manganese-Based Cathodes via Self-Regulating Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c05876</link>

                The irreversible oxygen-redox reactions in the high-voltage region of sodium-layered cathode materials lead to poor capacity retention and structural instability during cycling, presenting a significant challenge in the development of high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries. This work introduces a high-entropy design for layered Na0.67Li0.1Co0.1Cu0.1Ni0.1Ti0.1Mn0.5O2 (Mn-HEO) cathode with a self-regulating mechanism to extend specific capacity and energy density. The oxygen redox reaction was activated during the initial charging process, accompanied by the self-regulation of active elements, enhancing the ionic bonds to form a vacancy wall near the TM vacancies and thus preventing the migration of transition metal elements. Systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations comprehensively support the understanding of the self-regulation mechanism of Mn-HEO. As a result, the Mn-HEO cathode exhibits a stable structure during cycling. It demonstrates almost zero strain within a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.5 V with a remarkable specific capacity (177 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.05 C) and excellent long-term cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C). This work opens a new pathway for enhancing the stability of oxygen-redox chemistry and revealing a mechanism of crystal structure evolution for high-energy-density layered oxides.</description>

      <title>Seawater oxygen isotopes as a tool for monitoring future meltwater from the Antarctic ice-sheet</title>

                Abstract To reduce uncertainties in future sea level projections, it is necessary to closely monitor the evolution of the Antarctic ice-sheet. Here, we show that seawater oxygen isotopes are an effective tool to monitor ice-sheet freshwater discharge and its contributions to sea level rise. Using the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model with imposed estimates of future meltwater fluxes, we find that the anthropogenic ice-sheet signal in water isotopes emerges above natural variability decades earlier than salinity-based estimates. The superiority of seawater isotopes over salinity in detecting the ice-sheet melting can be attributed to the higher signal-to-noise ratio of the former and the fact that future sea ice changes only contribute little to seawater isotopes but a lot to salinity. We conclude that in particular in the Ross Sea sector, continuous seawater oxygen isotope measurements could serve as an early warning system for rapid anthropogenic Antarctic ice-sheet mass loss.</description>

      <title>The earliest phases of CNO enrichment in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.14615</link>
      <description>Martina Rossi, D. Romano, A. Mucciarelli, Edoardo Ceccarelli, D. Massari, G. Zamorani, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399991998

                Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

                Light-driven oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) for multi-carbon (C 2+ ) product evolution is a promising approach toward the sustainable production of value-added chemicals, yet remains challenging due to its low intrinsic activity. Here, we demonstrate the integration of bismuth oxide (BiO x ) and gold (Au) on titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) substrate to achieve a high conversion rate, product selectivity, and catalytic durability toward photocatalytic OCM through rational catalytic site engineering. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the lattice oxygen in BiO x is effectively activated as the localized oxidant to promote methane dissociation, while Au governs the methyl transfer to avoid undesirable overoxidation and promote carbon&#9472;carbon coupling. The optimal Au/BiO x -TiO 2 hybrid delivers a conversion rate of 20.8 millimoles per gram per hour with C 2+ product selectivity high to 97% in the flow reactor. More specifically, the veritable participation of lattice oxygen during OCM is chemically looped by introduced dioxygen via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, endowing superior catalyst stability.</description>

                Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) due to its favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</description>

      <title>Initial-state and final-state effects on hadron production in small collision systems</title>

                Heavy meson production in reactions with nuclei is an active new frontier to understand QCD dynamics and the process of hadronization in nuclear matter. Measurements in various colliding systems at RHIC and LHC, including Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, O-O, p-Pb, and p-O, enable precision tests of the medium-size, temperature, and mass dependencies of the in-medium parton propagation and shower formation. We employ a coupled DGLAP evolution framework that takes advantage of splitting functions recently obtained in softcollinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCETG) and hard thermal loop (HTL) motivated collisional energy loss effects. With jet quenching effects constrained to the nuclear modification factor of charged hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, we present predictions for light and heavy-meson in Xe-Xe, O-O and p-Pb collisions at the LHC.We find that the nuclear modification scales non-trivially with the quark mass and medium properties. In particular, there can be sizeable collision-induced attenuation of heavy mesons in small systems such as oxygen-oxygen and high-multiplicity p-Pb events. Finally, we analyze the impact of different models of initial-state parton dynamics on the search for QGP signatures in small colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Petrogenesis of the Dalaku&#8217;an Mafic&#8211;Ultramafic Intrusion in the East Kunlun, Xinjiang: Constraints from the Mineralogy of Amphiboles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min14070651</link>

                The Dalaku&#8217;an mafic&#8211;ultramafic intrusion, located in the western segment of the East Kunlun, presents conducive conditions for the magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide deposits. According to the detailed petrographic observation, the amphiboles within distinct rock types were analyzed by EPMA analysis. The crystallization conditions, such as temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and water content of the magma, were calculated to explore the genesis of the intrusion. The amphiboles were divided into three types: Amp-I, characterized by low silicon content but enrichment of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, predominantly comprising Tschermakitic hornblende and Magnesio-hornblende with mantle-derived traits; Amp-II, exhibiting elevated silicon content but diminished levels of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, primarily constituted of Magnesio-hornblende; whereas Amp-III manifests as Actinolitic hornblende, indicative of crustal origins. The calculated temperatures of amphiboles ranged between Amp-I (955&#8211;880) &#176;C, Amp-II (852&#8211;774) &#176;C, and Amp-III (761&#8211;760) &#176;C; the pressures ranged between Amp-I (454&#8211;274) MPa, Amp-II (194&#8211;93) MPa, and Amp-III (101&#8211;84) MPa; the oxygen fugacities (&#9651;NNO) ranged between Amp-I (0.93&#8211;2.17), Amp-II (1.55&#8211;2.52), and Amp-III (1.89); and the water contents (H2Omelt) ranged from (6.69&#8211;8.67) to (5.90&#8211;7.32). The magma experienced multiple stages of crystallization and underwent complex magma evolution at different depths. The high oxygen fugacity and water content could be attributed to the subduction of the oceanic crust. The magma source of the Dalaku&#8217;an intrusion was metasomatized by fluids from subducting plates, thereby originating within a post-collision extension.</description>

      <title>Local Environment and Migration Paths of the Proton Defect in Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia Studied by Ab Initio Calculations and Muon-Spin Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrogen5030021</link>

                The local binding and migration behavior of the proton defect in cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is studied by first-principles calculations and muon-spin spectroscopy (&#956;SR) measurements. The calculations are based on density-functional theory (DFT) supplemented with a hybrid-functional approach with the proton defect embedded in quasi-random supercells of 10.3 mol% yttria content, where the yttrium&#8211;zirconium substitutional defects are charge compensated by oxygen vacancies. Representative migration pathways for the proton comprising both transfer and bond reorientation modes are analysed and linked to the underlying microstructure of the YSZ lattice. The &#956;SR data show the evolution of the diamagnetic fraction corresponding to the muon-isotope analogue with an activation energy of diffusion equal to 0.17 eV. Comparisons between the calculations and the experiment allow an assessment of the character of the short-range migration of the proton particle in cubic YSZ.</description>

      <title>Histone oxidation as a new mechanism of metabolic control over gene expression</title>

                The emergence of aerobic respiration created unprecedented bioenergetic advantages, while imposing the need to protect critical genetic information from reactive byproducts of oxidative metabolism (i.e., reactive oxygen species, ROS). The evolution of histone proteins fulfilled the need to shield DNA from these potentially damaging toxins, while providing the means to compact and structure massive eukaryotic genomes. To date, several metabolism-linked histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been shown to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. However, whether and how PTMs enacted by metabolically produced ROS regulate adaptive chromatin remodeling remain relatively unexplored. Here, we review novel mechanistic insights into the interactions of ROS with histones and their consequences for the control of gene expression regulation, cellular plasticity, and behavior.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dynamics of O2 desorption from cobalt phthalocyanine by in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

                We report here the in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) study of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)-catalyzed O2 evolution reaction (OER) and the dynamics of CoPc-O2 dissociation. The self-assembled CoPc monolayer is fabricated on Au(111) substrate and resolved by ECSTM in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The OH&#8722; adsorption on CoPc prior to OER is observed in ECSTM images. During OER, the generated O2 adsorbed on CoPc is observed in the CoPc monolayer. Potential step experiment is employed to monitor the desorption of OER-generated O2 from CoPc, which results in the decreasing surface coverage of CoPc-O2 with time. The rate constant of O2 desorption is evaluated through data fitting. The insights into the dynamics of Co-O2 dissociation at the molecular level via in situ imaging help understand the role of Co-O2 in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Character Mapping, Bayesian Model Selection, and Biosynthetic Pathways Shed New Light on the Evolution of Habitat Preference in Cyanobacteria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syae025</link>
      <description>Giorgio Bianchini, Martin Hagemann, Patricia S&#225;nchez&#8208;Baracaldo, Systematic biology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400091897

                Abstract Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes to have evolved oxygenic photosynthesis paving the way for complex life. Studying the evolution and ecological niche of cyanobacteria and their ancestors is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of biosphere evolution. These organisms frequently deal with environmental stressors such as salinity and drought, and they employ compatible solutes as a mechanism to cope with these challenges. Compatible solutes are small molecules that help maintain cellular osmotic balance in high salinity environments, such as marine waters. Their production plays a crucial role in salt tolerance, which, in turn, influences habitat preference. Among the five known compatible solutes produced by cyanobacteria (sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine), their synthesis varies between individual strains. In this study, we work in a Bayesian stochastic mapping framework, integrating multiple sources of information about compatible solute biosynthesis in order to predict the ancestral habitat preference of Cyanobacteria. Through extensive model selection analyses and statistical tests for correlation, we identify glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate as the most significantly correlated with habitat preference, while trehalose exhibits the weakest correlation. Additionally, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine show high loss/gain rate ratios, indicating their potential role in adaptability, while sucrose and trehalose are less likely to be lost due to their additional cellular functions. Contrary to previous findings, our analyses predict that the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria (living at around 3180 Ma) had a 97% probability of a high salinity habitat preference and was likely able to synthesise glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate. Nevertheless, cyanobacteria likely colonized low-salinity environments shortly after their origin, with an 89% probability of the first cyanobacterium with low-salinity habitat preference arising prior to the Great Oxygenation Event (2460 Ma). Stochastic mapping analyses provide evidence of cyanobacteria inhabiting early marine habitats, aiding in the interpretation of the geological record. Our age estimate of ~2590 Ma for the divergence of two major cyanobacterial clades (Macro- and Microcyanobacteria) suggests that these were likely significant contributors to primary productivity in marine habitats in the lead-up to the Great Oxygenation Event, and thus played a pivotal role in triggering the sudden increase in atmospheric oxygen.</description>

      <title>Stability and Redox Mechanisms of Ni-Rich NMC Cathodes: Insights from First-Principles Many-Body Calculations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00928</link>
      <description>Hrishit Banerjee, Clare P. Grey, Andrew J. Morris, Chemistry of materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399916764

                Ni-rich LiNiaMnbCocO2 (NMC) cathodes undergo a series of degradation reactions, a prominent one being oxygen loss from the surface of the NMC particles; this process is more pronounced as Ni content is increased and at high voltages. Our first-principles study examines the redox behavior of transition metals (TMs) and O in Ni-rich NMC cathodes as a function of (de)lithiation. We use ab initio multiple scattering, density-functional theory (DFT)-based core-loss spectroscopy, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to give a many-body treatment of both dynamic and static correlations. Despite Ni, Mn, and Co K-edges calculated using ab initio multiple scattering based on Green's functions showing an excellent match with experimentally obtained X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES), we demonstrate that the ionic model of ascribing shifts in the XANES spectra to changes in metal oxidation states is inappropriate. We show that in these cases, which are characterized by strong covalency between the TM and oxygen, DMFT calculations based on Wannier projections are to date to the best of our knowledge the most accurate as well as computationally accessible method to calculate charges and hence assign oxidation states accurately. Due to the corresponding charge transfer from O p to Ni d, a ligand hole forms on O in Ni-rich regions. The individual Ni charge remains fairly constant throughout the charging/discharging process, particularly in Ni-rich environments in the material. In contrast, O has dual redox behavior, showing greater involvement in redox in Ni-rich regions while showing negligible redox involvement in Ni-poor regions. The Ni&#8211;O covalent system starts participating in redox around a state of delithiation of &#8764;17%, which represents, in our system, the beginning of the charge. Contrary to previous DFT calculations, we show that Co oxidation does not occur at the very end of charge but rather starts at an earlier state of delithiation of &#8764;67%. The dual behavior of O in terms of participation in the redox process helps explain the overall higher relative stability of lower Ni content NMCs compared to Ni-rich NMCs or LiNiO2 in terms of O loss and evolution of singlet oxygen.</description>

      <title>eReaxFF force field development for BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-&#948; solid oxide electrolysis cells applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01268-9</link>

                Abstract The use of solid-oxide materials in electrocatalysis applications, especially in hydrogen-evolution reactions, is promising. However, further improvements are warranted to overcome the fundamental bottlenecks to enhancing the performance of solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which is directly linked to the more-refined fundamental understanding of complex physical and chemical phenomena and mass exchanges that take place at the surfaces and in the bulk of electrocatalysis materials. Here, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate doped with 20 mol% of yttrium, BaZr 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3-&#948; (BZY20) to enable a systematic, large-length-scale, and longer-timescale atomistic simulation of solid-oxide electrocatalysis for hydrogen generation. All parameters for the eReaxFF were optimized to reproduce quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy migrations, electron localization, water adsorption, water splitting, and hydrogen generation on the surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we performed both zero-voltage (excess electrons absent) and non-zero-voltage (excess electrons present) molecular dynamics simulations to observe water adsorption, water splitting, proton migration, oxygen-vacancy migrations, and eventual hydrogen-production reactions. Based on investigations offered in the present study, we conclude that the eReaxFF force field-based approach can enable computationally efficient simulations for electron conductivity, electron leakage, and other non-zero-voltage effects on the solid oxide materials using the explicit-electron concept. Moreover, we demonstrate how the eReaxFF force field-based atomistic-simulation approach can enhance our understanding of processes in SOEC applications and potentially other renewable-energy applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of MgO addition on the structural evolution, crystallization and properties of self-glazed ceramics sintered from granite sludge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.06.355</link>
      <description>Changyou Liu, Jinshan Lu, Jian Zhou, Ceramics international. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400063362

                Recycling of granite sludge has both economic and environmental benefits. In this paper, high glossiness self-glazed ceramics were prepared from granite sludge with the addition of TiO2, Ca(OH)2 and MgO by combining two-step sintering and low-temperature crystallization. The effect of MgO addition on the phase evolution, crystallization and properties of the glazed ceramics was studied to reveal its role in the diopside precipitation. With increasing MgO content, the reduced glass viscosity accelerates the dissolution of quartz and anorthite into the liquid glass phase, resulting in a decrease in flexural strength above 1% MgO. Meanwhile, the addition of MgO increases the non-bridging oxygen to lower the glass transition temperature. The increase in the Al/Si ratio of the glass phase and the mixed alkaline earth effect contribute to an increase in the crystallization temperature. After thermal treatment at 950 &#176;C, the precipitated diopside increases the crystallinity of the glazed glass-ceramic from 6.4% to 19.3% at 3% MgO, resulting in a surface glossiness of 99.7 GU and a flexural strength of 64.1 MPa. High glossiness self-glazed ceramics with an aesthetic appearance could be used in decorative building tiles for scalable utilization of granite sludge.</description>

                Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial cell growth confined within the milk ducts. Although there has been extensive research on genetic and epigenetic causes of breast carcinogenesis, none of these studies have successfully identified a biomarker for the progression and/or upstaging of DCIS. In this study, we show that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging. First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to define habitats in the tumor intra-ductal microenvironment based on oxygen diffusion distance in our DCIS cohort of 84 patients. Then, we identify cancer cells with metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype, and LAMP2b indicating a hypoxia-induced acid adaptation. Traditionally these markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological perspective, their power to differentiate between indolent and upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology techniques, we discovered distinct spatial patterns of these biomarkers and used the distribution of such patterns to predict patient upstaging. The patterns were characterized by both cellular features and spatial features. With a 5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest classifier to achieve the area under curve(AUC) of 0.74. Our results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital pathology by demonstrating the role of eco-evolution dynamics in predicting cancer progression.</description>

      <title>Geochemistry characterization of diagenesis from Mishrif reservoir rocks in the Central Mesopotamian Basin, Iraq: Implication for the differential diagenesis and petroleum significance</title>

                The Cenomanian Mishrif Formation is one of the most important carbonate reservoirs in the Mesopotamian Basin. Detailed petrographic analysis, aided by geochemistry and burial history establishment on Mishrif carbonates from the AD oilfield, located at the margins of the Central Mesopotamian Basin of Iraq, presents a distinctive differential diagenetic mechanism that significantly impacts reservoir quality and exhibits a pronounced relationship with tectonic evolution and hydrocarbon accumulation. Analyses of petrographic features, carbon&#8209;oxygen isotopes, and minor and rare-earth elements reveal that echinoderm shells and rim calcites are results of marine waters; sparry calcites, matrix, and vein calcites from host rock primarily precipitate from meteoric fluid; microspars and vein calcites in the concretionary limestone are derived from brine water. The development of concretionary limestone mainly involves a complex process that comprises extensive bioturbation in marine waters, substantial fabric-selective dissolution in the meteoric zone, and significant sparry calcites occluded dissolved spaces in shallow burial environments. Winding and skew seams of argillaceous sediment around concretionary limestones, as well as the excellent preservation of skeletal remains inside the concretionary zone, manifest that the development of the concretionary limestone accomplished during the early diagenesis stage and pre-compaction. These centimeter-to-decimeter scaled concretionary limestone intermixed with host rock holding abundant open porosities shape the Mishrif reservoir and result in an inconspicuous, dual permeability system. The burial history, integrated with the diagenetic sequence and tectonic evolution, elucidates four stages that clarify interactions of diagenesis, porosity preservation, and hydrocarbon accumulation. The Cenomanian to Turonian period was a critical stage for the development of effective reservoir capacity. The end of the Cretaceous, marked by the contraction of the Neo-Tethys and the complete closure of the South Neo-Tethys, witnessed an early hydrocarbon accumulation event that enhanced reservoir porosity preservation. During the Paleocene to the Early Miocene epoch, the Neo-Tethys tended to be closing. As a result, the Mishrif Formation experienced shallow burial and generated typical concretionary limestone, which provided a rigid framework against compaction. From the Early Miocene to the present, the total closure of the Neo-Tethys and the Zagros Orogeny initiated a significant late oil-filling event that acted as the main accumulation moment, coinciding with efficient trap development and other optimal petroleum conditions. This study contributes to (1) comprehending the genesis of the differential diagenesis and its effect on pore structures and reservoir heterogeneity, and (2) Linking diagenetic sequence to tectonic evolution and hydrocarbon accumulation of foreland basins evolved from Neo-Tethys tectonics.</description>

      <title>Massive Interacting Binaries as an Enrichment Source for Multiple Populations in Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4a61</link>
      <description>Michelle Nguyen, Alison Sills, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 969(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399972766

                Abstract We present a suite of binary evolution models with massive primaries (10 &#8804; M 1 &#8804; 40 M &#8857; ) and periods and mass ratios chosen such that the systems undergo nonconservative mass transfer while the primaries have helium cores. We track the total mass and chemical composition of the ejecta from these systems. This material shows the abundance signatures of hot hydrogen burning that are needed to explain the abundance patterns seen in multiple populations in massive star clusters. We then calculate the total yield of a population of binary stars with masses, mass ratios, and periods consistent with their distribution in a field population. We show that the overall abundance of this material is enriched in helium, nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, and depleted in carbon, oxygen, and magnesium, by amounts that are consistent with observations. We also show that such a population of binaries will return approximately 25% of its mass in this ejecta (compared to 4% if all the stars were single), over a characteristic timescale of about 12 Myr. We argue that massive binaries must be seriously considered as a contributor to the source of enriched material needed to explain the multiple populations in massive clusters, since essentially all massive stars are formed in binaries or higher-order multiples, massive binaries are primarily formed in clusters, and massive binaries naturally produce material of the right composition.</description>

                The evolution of a multilayer sample surface during focused ion beam processing was simulated using the level set method and experimentally studied by milling a silicon dioxide layer covering a crystalline silicon substrate. The simulation took into account the redeposition of atoms simultaneously sputtered from both layers of the sample as well as the influence of backscattered ions on the milling process. Monte Carlo simulations were applied to produce tabulated data on the angular distributions of sputtered atoms and backscattered ions. Two sets of test structures including narrow trenches and rectangular boxes with different aspect ratios were experimentally prepared, and their cross sections were visualized in scanning transmission electron microscopy images. The superimposition of the calculated structure profiles onto the images showed a satisfactory agreement between simulation and experimental results. In the case of boxes that were prepared with an asymmetric cross section, the simulation can accurately predict the depth and shape of the structures, but there is some inaccuracy in reproducing the form of the left sidewall of the structure with a large amount of the redeposited material. To further validate the developed simulation approach and gain a better understanding of the sputtering process, the distribution of oxygen atoms in the redeposited layer derived from the numerical data was compared with the corresponding elemental map acquired by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Functionalized Diamond Nanocone Arrays Coupling Cobalt Phthalocyanine for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

                The development of high-efficiency catalysts plays a crucial role in advancing CO2 electroreduction techniques. Among potential candidate, diamond-based electrocatalysts show promise due to their broad electrochemical windows, which effectively suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and ensure high CO2 reduction efficiency. In this study, we report an integrated electrode composed of oxygen-terminated diamond nanocone (ODcone) with CoPc-molecules anchoring (CoPc/ODcone). The CoPc/ODcone electrodes exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.1% for CO at &#8722;0.97 V vs. RHE, and maintaining an FECO higher than 80% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.67 V to &#8722;1.07 V vs. RHE. The outstanding performance of the CoPc/ODcone electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the nanostructured diamond surface and the CoPc catalyst. The hydroxyl-rich nature of the diamond surface facilitates the anchoring of CoPc molecules and bonding with Co atoms in CoPc. Simultaneously, the nanostructured diamond with sharp tips enhances CO2 adsorption, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of non-metallic carbon materials, particularly diamond, as metal-free catalysts in CO2 electrochemical reduction and tackles challenges such as low current density and poor Faradaic efficiency, thus contributing to the advancement of more effective catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of functional traits in Gracilaria dura with the local environment: implications for resource management and exploitation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1397379</link>
      <description>Vasco M. N. C. S. Vieira, Pankaj S. Dawange, Santlal Jaiswar, Jos&#233; P. Sardinha, Vaibhav A. Mantri, Frontiers in marine science. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400056188

                Seaweed functional traits provide insights on natural populations, their adaptations to the local environment, which can be utilized for commercial exploitation. Here, we analyzed the functional traits of Gracilaria dura from two intertidal populations in Veraval and Adri, from the coast of Gujarat, India, over a period of three months. Functional traits were measured by analyzing growth rates, respiration, primary production, antioxidant activity and the content of plant growth hormones. The weight-to-length allometric exponent &#8776;3 indicated that G. dura grew almost isometrically. Furthermore, frond shape was not significantly different. Fronds in Veraval, resting submerged, grew faster than the fronds in Adri, which, lay exposed in the flat bare rock during low tide. Accordingly, the simultaneous increase in antioxidant activity, O 2 production and chlorophyll content in fronds from Adri suggests that stress from desiccation and UV led to the detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species, leading to decreased growth and decreased production of growth hormones. The increased Chl-a may indicate enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) for the dissipation of excess absorbed light. These results aid in establishing the best practices for maximizing biomass yield or the yield of specific molecules. For maximized biomass yield, fronds should not be subject to emersion nor cultivated on the sea-surface. On the other hand, fronds grown subject to emersion or at the sea-surface yield less biomass but more content on molecules such as antioxidants (flavonoids, phenolics, enzymes), that fight stress from desiccation high temperatures and UV. In this case, stress should still be avoided during the initial growth, at the onset of the growth season, in order to not disrupt the production of growth hormones. The increased O 2 production at Adri was initially mistakenly perceived as enhanced Net Primary Production. Only a posterior holistic perspective over the whole data allowed to conclude that it was likely the stress-induced detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species. More robust experiments are required to establish if the differences observed between locations have led to the evolution of genetic strains specific to each habitat that may show different performances and yields when cultivated in similar environments.</description>

      <title>Synergistic coupling of defective Ru nanoclusters with oxygen ligand steered Ru single atoms modifying interfacial water structure and key intermediates bonding toward efficient hydrogen energy conversion</title>

                Constructing highly efficient ruthenium (Ru) based electrocatalysts and understanding their reaction mechanisms for hydrogen energy conversion are highly desirable, but extremely challenge. Herein, we integrate the well dispersed defective Ru nanoclusters and oxygen coordinated Ru single atoms into one electrocatalyst (RuSAO4/RuNC) toward alkaline hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER). Synergistic catalytic mechanism of dual sites has been revealed by in situ ATR SEIRAS characterization, EDTA/SCN&#8211; poisoning experiments and DFT calculations. Benefiting from the electronic redistribution between RuSAO4 and RuNC sites, the single atom RuSAO4 species can act as Lewis acid sites that display strong affinity toward interfacial water via an O down (H2O&#8595;) conformation and subsequently promote water dissociation/formation as well as hydroxide adsorption. Meanwhile, adjacent defective Ru sites have around thermoneutral value of H adsorption free energy. RuNC works with RuSAO4 species, collaboratively reducing reaction barriers. As expected, the RuSAO4/RuNC achieves 20.3 times mass activity of commercial Pt/C for alkaline HOR at 10 mV overpotential and excellent alkaline HER activity with a low overpotential of 22 mV to deliver 10 mA cm&#8722;2, as well as considerable HER mass activity of 17.0 times compared to commercial Pt/C at 50 mV overpotential. Besides, the synergistic dual sites strategy can also be extended to prepare efficient PtSAO4/PtNC and IrSA-O4/IrNC electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Sleep and Oxidative Stress: Current Perspectives on the Role of NRF2</title>

                Abstract Sleep is a fundamental conserved physiological state across evolution, suggesting vital biological functions that are yet to be fully clarified. However, our understanding of the neural and molecular basis of sleep regulation has increased rapidly in recent years. Among various processes implicated in controlling sleep homeostasis, a bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress has recently emerged. One proposed function of sleep may be the mitigation of oxidative stress in both brain and peripheral tissues, contributing to the clearance of reactive species that accumulate during wakefulness. Conversely, reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), at physiological levels, may act as signaling agents to regulate redox-sensitive transcriptional factors, enzymes, and other effectors involved in the regulation of sleep. As a primary sensor of intracellular oxidation, the transcription factor NRF2 is emerging as an indispensable component to maintain cellular redox homeostasis during sleep. Indeed, a number of studies have revealed an association between NRF2 dysfunction and the most common sleep conditions, including sleep loss, obstructive sleep apnea, and circadian sleep disturbances. This review examines the evidence of the intricate link between oxidative stress and NRF2 function in the context of sleep, and highlights the potential of NRF2 modulators to alleviate sleep disturbances. Graphical Abstract A bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress has been shown, indicating that sleep may play a protective role against the accumulation of reactive species during wakefulness and sleep deprivation. However, reactive species might also serve as signaling molecules that influence sleep regulation mechanisms. Notably, as a sensor of cellular redox changes, the transcription factor NRF2 is emerging as a key regulator of sleep homeostasis.</description>

      <title>Choice of reaction progress variable under preferential diffusion effects in turbulent syngas combustion based on detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64552-0</link>
      <description>Vinzenz Silvester Wehrmann, Nilanjan Chakraborty, Markus Klein, Josef Ha&#223;lberger, Scientific reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400083587

                The combustion of hydrogen and carbon-monoxide mixtures, so-called syngas, plays an increasingly important role in the safety context of non-fossil energy generation, more specifically in the risk management of incidents in process engineering plants for ammonia synthesis and in nuclear power plants. In order to characterize and simulate syngas/air combustion on industrially relevant scales, subgrid modelling is required, which is often based on a reaction progress variable. To understand the influence of different fuel compositions, turbulence intensities and flame topologies on different possible definitions of reaction progress variable, detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations data of premixed, lean hydrogen/air and syngas/air flames has been considered. A reaction progress variable based on normalized molecular oxygen mass fraction has been found not to capture the augmentation of the normalized burning rate per unit flame surface area in comparison to the corresponding 1D unstretched premixed flame due to preferential diffusion effects. By contrast, reaction progress variables based on other individual species, such as hydrogen, can capture the augmentation of the rate of burning well, but exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to preferential diffusion effects, especially in response to flame curvatures. However, a reaction progress variable based on the linear combination of the main products can accurately represent the temperature evolution of the flame for different mixtures, turbulence intensities and varying local flame topology, while effectively capturing the augmentation of burning rate due to preferential diffusion effects. However, its tendency to assume values larger than 1.0 in the regions of super-adiabatic temperatures poses challenges for future modeling approaches, whereas the reaction progress variable based on hydrogen mass fraction remains bound between 0.0 and 1.0 despite showing deviations in comparison to corresponding variations obtained from the unstretched laminar flame depending on flame curvature variations.</description>

      <title>Amphibole geochemistry in the Haobugao skarn Zn-Fe-Sn deposit in the southern Great Xing&#8217;an Range: Implications for the ore-forming process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106122</link>
      <description>Lijie Liu, Taofa Zhou, Shao&#8208;Yong Jiang, Dayu Zhang, Noel C. White, Ore geology reviews. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399999917

                The Haobugao Zn-Fe-Sn deposit is a typical skarn deposit in the southern Great Xing'an Range of NE China. Despite many advances in understanding its genesis, the detailed ore-forming processes of Zn, Fe and Sn are still unclear. Amphibole, a rock-forming mineral, has been well studied as an indicator of diverse magmatic and metamorphic processes; however, the geochemistry of hydrothermal amphibole has previously received less attention. The Haobugao deposit contains two generations of hydrothermal amphibole (Amp-I and Amp-&#8545;), which provides a good opportunity to use amphibole geochemistry to trace the mineralization process. Early Amp-I coexists with cassiterite, magnetite and quartz, whereas late Amp-II coexists with quartz and sulfides and can be further divided into two subgroups: Amp-&#8545;a (in skarn) and Amp-&#8545;b (in the country rocks of siltstone). The oxygen isotopic compositions of the fluid (&#948;18Ofluid 2.9&#8240;) responsible for the Amp-I formation indicate that the amphiboles formed from mixed magmatic fluid with meteoric water. Amp-I is LREE-depleted and HREE-enriched with obvious negative Eu anomalies. Amp-&#8545; is generally slightly LREE-depleted with negative or positive Eu anomalies and positive Ce anomalies. The incorporation of trace and rare elements is mainly controlled by the fluid composition. Detailed petrological observations and amphibole geochemistry, combined with previous research results, confirm that Sn, Fe, Pb and Zn mineralization occurred during a single mineralization event. From the oxide to the quartz sulfide stage, the ore-forming fluid evolved from high-temperature and oxidized conditions with enrichment of Sn, Li, Be and REEs to low-temperature and reduced or oxidized conditions with enrichment of Cu, Co and Zn. The concentrations of Cu, Co and Zn in different amphiboles vary with the mineral crystallization sequence. This study shows that amphibole geochemistry can be useful for tracing fluid evolution and mineralization processes in hydrothermal systems.</description>

                On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</description>

                The subject of the research focused on the possibilities of supporting the design of surface water treatment plants using laboratory models. Within the pilot study, the possibilities of using different water treatment processes in the treatment of water from the water reservoir Nov&#233; Ml&#253;ny in the Czech Republic were assessed. The planned treatment plant is to supply a future recreational site from a shallow reservoir with significant eutrophication and chemical industry in the drainage basin. Coagulation, sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, membrane filtration processes and adsorption on granular activated carbon were investigated. These processes were identified by the preliminary study as applicable to water treatment and it was necessary to determine which could be applied given the site conditions. Laboratory models for the individual processes were used during the laboratory testing. During the research, problems encountered were debugged and the models were modified and some extensions were added to the original models. The coagulation and sedimentation processes were investigated using conventional jar tests. The dissolved air flotation process was simulated using a modified jar test and a lab scale model. Different types and doses of coagulants, mixing parameters and residence times were investigated in the tests. Turbidity value was used as an optimization parameter due to its rapidity of determination and low cost. For some tests, potassium permanganate oxidizability (also known as the permanganate index) was also used as an evaluation parameter so that different evaluation parameters could be compared. In addition, for the dissolved air flotation process, the parameters of the produced sludge - its quantity, suspended solids content and chemical oxygen demand - were monitored. These parameters are crucial for discharge of waste water into the sewer and its costs. The adsorption tests on granular activated carbon were performed as batch tests. The evaluation parameter was the manganese index. Another possible variant of activated carbon tests is a continuous flow-through column. These columns also allow monitoring of the process of fouling and the evolution of the effluent over time. The pilot project then used the results of the laboratory tests to create a design for a treatment plant in the area of interest and selected parts of the project documentation. The pilot project demonstrated the usefulness of laboratory testing as a tool to support the design of drinking water treatment plants. At the same time, these tests allow for a faster and more certain identification of the appropriate water treatment technology and thus reduce the extent of semi-operational testing at the site, leading to a more efficient use of funds by investors.</description>

      <title>Enhanced mobility of iron and manganese on mars: Evidence from kinetic experiments and models</title>

                Several missions have reported complex alteration mineralogies on early Mars, which preserve environmental records of multiple water-rock-atmosphere interactions. The MSL and M2020 missions in Gale and Jezero have identified Fe and Mn-bearing secondary phases. These elements are used as tracers for the redox conditions on both Earth and Mars. However, to fully understand the short-lived and local-scale processes observed on Mars, it is necessary to go beyond thermodynamic models and experiments. Enhancing our ability to interpret the redox and hydrological conditions from the observed phase assemblage requires understanding the evolution of Fe and Mn during weathering. This study reports the results of kinetic alteration experiments and geochemical models conducted under Mars-like conditions. We tested variable pO2, pCO2, temperatures, and starting solutions. The results suggest that Fe is more mobile on Mars than on Earth, with a pseudo-equilibrium concentration that is kinetically controlled by dissolution and oxidation rates. Despite some initially modeled siderite precipitation, no siderite precipitation was observed in the altered powder. Solutions with higher acid concentrations were primarily controlled by dissolution kinetics, with both Fe and Mn being mobile, even when a minor amount of P, Fe, and S bearing secondary phases are formed. Based on our experimental results, we updated the model and conducted two large-scale sensitivity tests on our kinetic simulation. We confirmed that our experiments were too high in pO2 for siderite to form; however, we found that over a range of clearly oxidizing conditions from an equilibrium standpoint, Fe and Mn are mostly mobile, and siderite precipitation can occur. We were able to determine the pO2, pCO2 and the temporal space where Fe-oxide or siderite predominate or coexist, constraining the meaning of reducing or oxidizing conditions. Moreover, we also observed that siderite formation would require a much longer water residence time than Fe-oxide to precipitate, interpreted as higher weathering rates, or later evaporation required to effectively precipitate under any conditions. On ancient Mars, both Fe and Mn would be relatively mobile and prone to be leached from their host rock. Observing siderite or oxide would not primarily be a redox marker but would be a clue to a different hydrological regime. At the planetary scale, it would be challenging to form authigenic siderite during alteration. Although siderite would not indicate the presence of a particularly reducing atmosphere and that Mn-oxides are mainly pH controlled and do not require terrestrial-level amounts of oxygen, a collocated precipitation of siderite and Mn-oxides could also provide valuable information to constrain the redox environment of the ancient Mars.</description>

      <title>Study on Novel SCR Catalysts for Denitration of High Concentrated Nitrogen Oxides and Their Reaction Mechanisms</title>

                With the rapid development of industrialization, the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) has become a global environmental issue. Uranium is the primary fuel used in nuclear power generation. However, the production of uranium, typically based on the uranyl nitrate method, usually generates large amounts of nitrogen oxides, particularly NO2, with concentrations in the exhaust gas exceeding 10,000 ppm. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are also produced during silver electrolysis processing and the treatment of waste electrolyte solutions. Traditional V-W/TiO2 NH3-SCR catalysts typically exhibit high catalytic activity at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 &#176;C, under conditions of low NOx concentrations and high gas hourly space velocity. However, their performance is not satisfying when reducing high concentrations of NO2. This study aims to optimize the traditional V-W/TiO2 catalysts to enhance their catalytic activity under conditions of high NO2 concentrations (10,000 ppm) and a wide temperature range (200&#8211;400 &#176;C). On the basis of 3 wt% Mo/TiO2, various loadings of V2O5 were selected, and their catalytic activities were tested. Subsequently, the optimal ratios of active component vanadium and additive molybdenum were explored. Simultaneously, doping with WO3 for modification was selected in the V-Mo/TiO2 catalyst, followed by activity testing under the same conditions. The results show that: the NOx conversion rates of all five catalysts increase with temperature at range of 200&#8211;400 &#176;C. Excessive loading of MoO3 decreased the catalytic performance, with 5 wt% being the optimal loading. The addition of WO3 significantly enhanced the low-temperature activity of the catalysts. When the loadings of WO3 and MoO3 were both 3 wt%, the catalyst exhibited the best denitrification performance, achieving a NOx conversion rate of 98.8% at 250 &#176;C. This catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in reducing very high concentration (10,000 ppm) NO2, at a wider temperature range, expanding the temperature range by 50% compared to conventional SCR catalysts. Characterization techniques including BET, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD were employed to further study the evolution of the catalyst, and the promotional mechanisms are explored. The results revealed that the proportion of chemisorbed oxygen (O&#945;) increased in the WO3-modified catalyst, exhibiting lower V reduction temperatures, which are favorable for low-temperature denitrification activity. NH3-TPD experiments showed that compared to MoOx species, surface WOx species could provide more acidic sites, resulting in stronger surface acidity of the catalyst.</description>

                Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] &lt; 2 mg/l, during the last two centuries has a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurance of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 yrs in lake Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany) using 17 gravity cores, recovered between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated by the onset of varve preservation in the TSK, and has been dated by varve counting to 1918&#177;1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake-floor depth of 16 m at 1997&#177;1. This indicates oxygen concentration to fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lakefloor (&gt;16 m). Sediment cores at 10&#8211;12 m depth do not contain varves indicating well oxygenation of the upper water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia at the depocenter is a period of five months of [O2] &lt; 5 mgl&#160; &#160;and two months of [O2] &lt; 2 mgl&#160;. Detailed TOC, &#948;13Corg and XRF core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the depletion in DO started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake following a transition phase of several decades during which varve preservation was not accomplished. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and not necessarily requires permanent stratification.</description>

      <title>Consistency between apatite and zircon petrochronology supports robustness of apatite in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4524703/v1</link>
      <description>Hongying Qu, J. V. Rowland, Jingwen Mao, Evan A. Orovan, Michael C. Rowe, Shihua Zhong, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399979490

                Abstract Apatite low-temperature thermochronology can be double or even triple dated allowing for a reconstruction of the thermal history of rock from ~ 550 oC to near-surface temperatures. Even though it has disadvantageous U&#8211;Th&#8211;Pb contents (high Pb contents and low U and Th contents) and an unstable nature, apatite is still regarded to have the same robustness in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems as zircon, so far as to be replace zircon. Hence, we systematically studied characteristics of morphology, geochronology and geochemistry of apatite hosted in syenogranite and monzogranite intrusive rocks in the large Hutouya skarn deposit, in order to corroborate its potential thermochronological monitoring capabilities like zircon in fingerprinting igneous processes in porphyry systems. In this study, apatite grains can be subdivided into two types, FI-free Apatite I formed in the early less fractionated magma and FI-rich Apatite II crystallized in the late highly fractionated magma stage. We obtained ages of 229.0 &#177; 6.6 Ma in syenogranite and 224.3 &#177; 4.5 Ma / 223.7 &#177; 3.9 Ma in monzogranite from Apatite I of magmatic origins. Zircon grains in the two granites can be classified into three types. Zircon I is characterized by transparent and bright zones, Zircon II by dark and metamict features, and Zircon III by mineral inclusions. Zircon I grains with a magmatic texture of well-developed bright oscillatory zones, are most likely primary magmatic zircon that crystallized early in the evolution of granitic magma, dating results of which are 224.70 &#177; 0.61 Ma in syenogranite intrusions and 225.75 &#177; 0.66 Ma / 226.31 &#177; 0.78 Ma in monzogranite, respectively. The apatite&#8211;zircon timing is coincident. Furthermore, apatite trace rare earth element contents in the syenogranite and monzogranite intrusions display a negative-slope chondrite-normalized distribution from La to Lu with strong negative Eu anomalies and weak positive Ce anomalies, with major element contents that are statistically identical with enriched F but poor Cl. Zircon trace element compositions in the two intrusions show consistent and steeply increasing chondrite-normalized REE diagrams from La to Lu with negative Eu anomalies and strong positive Ce anomalies. Accordingly, apatite U&#8211;Pb dates and the corresponding in-situ trace element compositions and isotopes can test precise constraints on rock formation ages, temperature, oxygen fugacity, material source, and tectonic background, which can be relatively more robust when used as proxies for magma oxidation state.</description>

In recent decades, other exciting frontiers have been reached, e.g. exploring new or invisible particles (neutrinos, dark matter). Nuclear physics plays a central role in our understanding of both the atomic nucleus and seemingly unrelated things, e.g. our understanding of the interaction of neutrinos with matter, or how stars are born and die. With this theme issue, we are bringing together contributions from prominent researchers in the field in order to showcase the vibrancy of nuclear physics, covering a broad selection of current frontier topics. Central to this theme issue is the interplay between experiment and theory as the driving force of breakthroughs in the field. With advances in both nuclear theory and experimental capabilities, it is more important than ever to build the foundations of a truly collaborative community. It is only when experiments are informed by theory, and theory guided by experiments, that real breakthroughs can be achieved. This theme issue will showcase these synergies, inspiring and triggering further such collaborations.This special issue brings together the wider nuclear physics community, from traditional nuclear structure, reactions and dynamics, to hadron physics, nuclear astrophysics and neutrino physics. Some of the contributions venture further afield and touch upon the relevance of machine-learning techniques to nuclear physics, while others discuss strongly correlated matter that (while sharing many commonalities with neutron matter) is experimentally accessible using ultracold atoms (not nucleons). This reinforces the liminal position of nuclear physics across many research frontiers. We also hope that this issue will prompt new theory-experiment synergies and that it will plant the seeds for cross-collaborations amongst different fields.All contributions to this theme issue involve a mixture of theoretical and experimental work: exactly because nuclear physics stands at the interface between different scales, research in the field needs to make use of all available tools, both traditional/established and novel/exploratory. To make matters concrete, in what follows we will briefly discuss the contributions that now lie between one set of covers, starting with the mainly theoretical ones. In addition to briefly highlighting what is novel in the works contained herein, we also attempt to find a guiding thread through all of the original works that form the present theme issue.The work by Soma and Duguet nicely illustrates the aforementioned juxtaposition of traditional and novel approaches. The article hones in on the tool known as effective single-particle energies, which originally arose in the context of single-particle studies of shell structure in atomic nuclei. The authors clearly delineate the non-observable character of effective single-particle energies but do not limit themselves to criticism: they make contact with both modern ab initio quantum many-body studies of nuclei and experimental work. Specifically, they employ the successful Gorkov&#8211;Green's function approach to tackle a system recently studied experimentally at iThemba LABS. Through a combination of pedagogical exposition and original results, the scheme-dependence of effective single-particle energies is brought into sharp relief. While results focus on a specific neutron spin-orbit splitting along N = 20 isotones, the lessons gleaned from such studies are much more general.The next theoretical work (as well as the two following ones) falls into the large category of Monte Carlo approaches, employing random numbers to study a problem in microphysics. Specifically, Drissi et al. employ a continuum quantum Monte Carlo approach: variational Monte Carlo, in which a sophisticated guess for the ground-state wave function of a quantum many-body system is optimized in order to estimate physical properties as accurately as possible. A promising such guess that has been heavily used recently is that of neural-network quantum states; the authors go over neural wave functions with an added emphasis on the optimization algorithm. They discuss the Kronecker Factored Approximate Curvature optimizer in detail and transcend its shortcomings via novel extensions. The authors also take the opportunity to reformulate their approach using the language of game theory; via the concept of decision geometry, they propose a new optimizer that behaves better than standard ones (or the authors' own earlier approaches). While the physical system tackled involves a central interaction, such approaches hold the promise of improving future nuclear calculations of related quantities.The work by Morrell et al. also studies spin-1/2 fermions (i.e. does not specifically address nucleons), which could function as a foundation for later nuclear studies. The main tool employed here is also quantum Monte Carlo; unlike the earlier work that used a continuum approach, Morrell et al. place their strongly interacting particles on a spatial lattice in addition to discretizing the (imaginary) time evolution. Crucially, the authors of this work are able to use very few temporal steps/a very coarse grid in the time direction via a quantum cumulant expansion, i.e. using automated algebra rather than the more typical numerical approach. The system studied is not just a toy problem: cold fermions at unitarity have been extensively probed in lab work over the last two decades using dilute atomic systems. Thus, the authors provide specific comparisons with results from an MIT experiment, not only for the pressure, but also for the compressibility and heat capacity. Unlike much of nuclear-structure physics, this work is carried out at finite temperatures; such approaches to the thermodynamics of strongly coupled systems can guide future work on nuclear astrophysics.The work by Curry et al. similarly employs a lattice Monte Carlo formalism, this time at 0 temperature. The specific technique used is auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, which has in the past been quite successful in condensed-matter and cold-atom studies; its main characteristic feature is the choice of working in a Slater-determinant space. The authors start by benchmarking against one- and two-dimensional results for the Hubbard model, a mainstay of solid-state physics. They then discuss experimentally relevant results for cold fermions at unitarity (also touched upon in the previous paragraph), paying close attention to the question of how to extrapolate away the lattice/discretization effects. The authors then turn to nuclear systems, carefully tuning the two-body lattice interaction such that it reproduces the neutron&#8211;neutron scattering length and effective range. They round things off by studying the energy of a few to many strongly interacting neutrons for a variety of lattice sizes. Given the power of the many-body technique and the promise of these neutron-matter results, one can expect extensions to bound states/atomic nuclei using similar approaches in the near future.Moving to a more synergistic contribution on both experiment and theory, Roth and Petri review the developments of the ab initio frontier, where chiral effective field theories of the strong interaction are being exploited to derive nuclear interactions and form the foundation of modern ab initio methods. Such an approach is bringing us closer to the understanding of nuclei from first principles, rooted in the theory of the strong interaction, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Key to advancing the frontiers of ab initio theory is pioneering experiments on atomic nuclei that confront ab initio predictions and provide unparalleled benchmarks for the development and refinement of the theoretical approaches. This contribution puts forward selected experimental efforts along the carbon and oxygen chains that aim at validating these calculations, with a focus on electromagnetic observables, which present a particular challenge for ab initio theory. What will decisively drive future developments and breakthroughs in our understanding of the atomic nucleus from first principles is the strong synergy between experiment and theory and this contribution celebrates this.The work of Uesaka and Itagaki discusses the manifestation of non-uniformity in nuclei in the form of nuclear clustering. This review presents an interesting collection of examples of nuclear clustering throughout the nuclear chart and considers the underlying driving mechanism for this phenomenon, in terms of the tensor and spin-orbit forces as well as modern nucleon&#8211;nucleon interactions. Clustering plays a critical role in the origin of elements with further implications for nuclear fission and the potential to produce superheavy elements. Experimental breakthroughs in probing clustering in medium and heavy nuclei are explored and new experimental approaches, through knockout reactions, are presented.Continuing the theme of synergistic theoretical and experimental work, and extending the impact of nuclear physics to the cosmos, Wiedeking and Goriely discuss the impact of photon strength functions (PSF) and nuclear level densities (NLD) on shaping the outcomes of various nucleosynthetic processes. The authors give an overview of both experimental and theoretical methods to determine PSF and NLD, how they impact the important quantities that enter the astrophysical simulations, i.e. the reaction rates, and subsequently, how this affects the obtained abundances. Indeed, large uncertainties for (p,&#947;), (n,&#947;) and (&#945;,&#947;) reaction rates across many regions of the nuclear chart are uncovered from diverse NLD and PSF model combinations, leading to potentially significant abundance variations of the nucleosynthesis processes. This contribution reflects on the critical role that nuclear physics plays in the cosmos and highlights how advances in theory and experimentation are enhancing our grasp of the origin of elements.Nuclear physics input is critical not only to our understanding of the origin of the elements but to other exotic objects in the cosmos, most notably neutron stars. Neutron stars, dense remnants of supernova explosions, contain matter that reaches extreme densities and pressure. Currently, their true nature remains an open question. The presence of hyperons, particles containing strange quarks, affects the equation of state, influencing the neutron star's size and internal structure. Understanding the behaviour of hadrons and hyperons within neutron stars sheds light on the fundamental physics governing these enigmatic celestial objects. The excitation spectra of hyperons provide critical constraints to models of big-bang nucleosynthesis with the majority of visible matter in the Universe progressing through excited hyperon states. Novel experimental efforts that allow us to bridge the knowledge gap on the interaction between hyperons and nucleons and underpin the rich hyperon excitation spectra are underway at the new K-long facility. Zachariou et al. discuss the K-Long facility at the Thomas Jefferson Laboratory and its potential to investigate the hyperon&#8211;nucleon interaction and hyperon spectroscopy. Such experimental constraints are critical for understanding and testing QCD in the strange sector and for underpinning our understanding of dense nuclear matter.Scientific technological advances have allowed us to discover new phenomena, e.g. neutrino oscillations. Although this type of experiment lies well within the domain of high-energy physics, nuclear physics has a fundamental role to play, e.g. in measurements of single and double beta-decay spectra that illuminate the scale and nature of the neutrino mass, and in neutrino&#8211;nucleus scattering that underpins oscillation experiments. It is these experimental advances that have brought down barriers between long-standing traditional fields of physics. The contribution by Parno et al. celebrates the intersection between long-standing traditional fields of physics by discussing experimental neutrino physics in a nuclear landscape. The authors present two nuclear laboratories for exploring neutrino physics, through nuclear beta decays, to shed light on the absolute neutrino-mass scale and answer the question of whether neutrinos are Majorana particles. Parno et al. further discuss the nuclear physics of high-energy neutrino interactions, essential for interpreting long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiments, the use of low-energy neutrino scattering to illuminate nuclear properties and supernova nucleosynthesis, neutrino probes of fission reactors, searches for sterile neutrinos and applications in quantum sensing.This issue concludes with one of the most exciting facilities for nuclear physics research that is coming online in the near future, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), and discusses Nuclear Structure opportunities with GeV radioactive beams across a range of fields and scales: from low-energy physics via the investigation of multi-neutron systems and halos, to high-density nuclear matter and the equation of state, following heavy-ion collisions, fission, study of short-range correlations in nuclei, as well as hypernuclei. The R3B setup features prominently as a versatile experiment to perform kinematically complete measurements with high-energy radioactive ion beams, and various physics cases pursued within its experimental capabilities are presented. Even more interestingly, the authors put forward future opportunities at FAIR of studying exotic nuclei scattering off light ions and electrons in storage rings, as well as the concept of multi-GeV experiments with radioactive beams.As our brief summaries show, the works presented here involve many length scales, subfields and methodologies. It is worth reiterating that bringing together both theoretical and experimental works in the same venue (while not commonly done) is a good way to highlight past progress and jumpstart future discoveries.
