                The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis, but it is challenging. Herein, ruthenium (Ru) single-atom-modified Co-HHTP (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) (Ru@Co-HHTP) was prepared via a solvothermal and ion exchange method. Systematic experiments highlight that the atomically dispersed Ru can optimize the electronic structure and electronic conductivity of Co-HHTP. As a result, the obtained Ru@Co-HHTP shows a low overpotential of 247 mV at 100 mA cm</description>

      <title>Structural Regulation of NiFe LDH under Spontaneous Corrosion to Enhance the Oxygen Evolution Properties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400640</link>
      <description>Yingjun Ma, Hangning Liu, Lin Wang, Changhui Sun, Liangyu Gong, Jie Wang, Jiangmin Jiang, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400977781

                Electrochemical water splitting holds promise for sustainable hydrogen production but restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the anodic oxygen evolution. Herein, we present a room-temperature spontaneous corrosion strategy to convert inexpensive iron (Fe) on iron foam substrates into highly active and stable self-supporting nickel iron layered hydroxide (NiFe LDH) catalysts. The corrosion evolution mechanisms are elucidated combining ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques, demonstrating precise control over the concentration of Ni2+ and reaction time to achieve controllable micro-structures of NiFe LDH. Taking advantage of the self-supporting morphology and hierarchical micro-/nano- structure, the NiFe LDH with optimized Ni2+ concentration and reaction time exhibits significant small overpotentials of 160 mV and 200 mV for the OER at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively, showcasing excellent OER activities. Furthermore, this catalyst demonstrates superior reaction kinetics, high electrochemical stability, and excellent integral water splitting performance when coupled with a commercial Pt/C cathode. The energy-efficient, cost-effective, and scalable spontaneous corrosion strategy opens new avenues for the development of high-electrochemical-interface catalysts.</description>

                Developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts in acidic media is essential for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Especially for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), high overpotential is needed to overcome the high thermodynamic energy barrier of water splitting. Herein, we report a high&#8208;efficiency self&#8208;supported ternary alloy OER catalyst with high activity and good durability in acidic electrolytes by a simple electrodeposition method. The as&#8208;prepared electrocatalyst consists of Ru, Au, and Mn alloy which is deposited on the carbon fiber paper (denoted as RuAuMn&#8208;CFP). The RuAuMn&#8208;CFP exhibits superior activity and only requires an overpotential of 131 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability of 30 h (10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic media, which outperforms the commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts. Besides, at an overpotential of 140 mV, the RuAuMn&#8208;CFP catalyst exhibited a remarkable mass activity of 29.63 mA/mg for OER. It is 7.9 times and 23.8 times higher than the commercial Ru/C and Ir/C catalysts (3.73 mA/mg, 1.24 mA/mg, respectively).</description>

      <title>Quantifying Stern Layer Water Alignment Prior to and During the Oxygen Evolution</title>

      <description>Raiden Speelman, Franz M. Geiger, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401026900

                While water's oxygen is the electron source in the industrially important oxygen evolution reaction, the strong absorber problem clouds our view of how the Stern layer water molecules orient themselves in response to applied potentials. Here, we report nonlinear optical measurements on nickel electrodes held at pH 13 indicating a disorder-to-order transition in the Stern layer water molecules prior to the onset of Faradaic current. A full water monolater (1.1 x 10^15 cm-2) aligns with oxygen atoms pointing towards the electrode at +0.8 V and the associated work is 80 kJ mol-1. Our experiments identify water flipping energetics as a target for understanding overpotentials, advance molecular electrochemistry, provide benchmarks for electrical double layer models, and serve as a diagnostic tool for understanding electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is critical to overcome the efficiency bottleneck in hydrogen generation via water electrolysis. Hollow nanostructured materials have emerged as a hot topic for electrocatalysis research because of their advantages, including abundant active sites, a large contact area between the catalyst and the electrolyte, and a short transmission path. As highly efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts, cobalt&#8208;based nanostructured materials have attracted more and more attention. In this work, cobalt metal/cobalt phosphides/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composites (Co&#8208;Co x P/NC) with a hierarchical hollow structure are designed by using hollow ZIF&#8208;67 microspheres as precursors. By coating ZIF&#8208;8 on the surface of hollow ZIF&#8208;67 microspheres and further carbonizing, carbon nanowhiskers are successfully formed on the surface of hollow carbon spheres under the catalytic effect of Co nanoparticles at a high temperature. In the subsequent phosphating process, solid Co nanocrystalline particles are transformed into core&#8211;shell CoP and Co 2 P nanoparticles on account of the Kirkendall effect. Through the optimization of the microstructure of the material and the synergistic effect of transition metal, transition metal phosphide, and nitrogen doping, the overpotential of the optimal material is only 287 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 current density in 1 m KOH.</description>

Then, we designed the structure of orange-peel carbon aerogel grown on iron-nickel layered double hydroxides in situ to achieve the effect of carbon coating (FeNi-LDH/CA). The oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance of FeNi-LDH/CA is excellent, far exceeding that of commercial RuO2. In 1 M KOH, the overpotential of FeNi-LDH/CA is only 250 mV (10 mA cm-2), obviously better than that of commercial RuO2 (295 mV). FeNi-LDH/CA shows good cycling stability, and after long-term i-t testing, the performance only decays by 3% after running at 100 mA cm-2 for 100 h. When used as an anode, the voltage of water-splitting is only 1.48 V at 10 mA cm-2. The rechargeable liquid zinc-air battery based on Pt/C-FeNi-LDH/CA catalyst has higher open-circuit voltage (1.543 V) and galvanostatic discharge capacity at 1.23 V (830 min, 10 mA cm-2). Moreover, the zinc-air battery based on Pt/C-FeNi-LDH/CA has a small charge-discharge voltage gap (0.65 V) at 10 mA cm-2, after 200 consecutive cycles (66 h), the charge-discharge voltage gap only increased by about 30 mV, indicating good cycling stability.</description>

                Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64%, a 3.5 nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158 mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8208;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8208;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Single-atom nickel on defective g-C4N3 as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER and ORR: a first-principles analysis</title>

                Abstract Searching for inexpensive and highly active materials to replace noble metals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important challenge. The two-dimensional semi-metallic carbon nitride g-C4N3 is an excellent candidate for electrochemical reactions owing to its eminent conductivity and stability. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) a series of low-budget non-noble transition metal single-atom (SAC) loaded on the g-C4N3 (named as TM@C4N3, TM=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) were investigated as electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. Ni@C4N3 shows an enormous application potential as electrode material, with OER and ORR overpotentials of 0.59 V and 0.23 V, respectively. The second lowest binding energy between Ni and support g-C4N3 indicates that Ni@C4N3 possesses good overall stability. The d-band center as well as metal valence as the descriptor exhibit good agreement with the adsorption energy of the intermediate. A linear relationship exists among the adsorption energies of the three intermediates O, OH, and OOH, given the similarity that they are all bonded to the metal through one oxygen atom. By adjusting the adsorption energy of these intermediates, the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts can be tuned for OER and ORR. This study confirmed that Ni@C4N3 is a good bifunctional catalyst and provides important guidance for the design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Performance of a Hybrid NiCo2O4@NiFelt Electrode at Different Operating Temperatures and Electrolyte pH</title>

                Transition metals such as nickel and cobalt as an alternative to Pt and Pd can be used for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and hydrogen production reactions (HERs) in alkaline environments, facilitating green hydrogen production as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. In this study, an NiCo2O4 catalyst was produced by a sono-hydrothermal method using urea as a hydrolysis agent. The electrochemical performance of the catalyst-coated NiFelt electrode was evaluated at different KOH concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1 M) and four operating temperatures in the interval of 20&#8211;80 &#176;C. The electrode characteristics were investigated via electrochemical spectroscopy (cyclic voltammetry, EIS, multistep chronopotentiometry, multistep chronoamperometry) using two different reference electrodes (Ag/AgCl and Hg/HgO), to obtain insight into the anodic and cathodic peaks. XRD, SEM, EDS, and TEM analyses confirmed the purity, structure, and nanoscale particle size (20&#8211;45 nm) of the NiCo2O4 catalyst. The electrode showed symmetric CV with Ag/AgCl, making this reference electrode more appropriate for capacitance measurements, while Hg/HgO proved advantageous for EIS in alkaline solutions due to reduced noise. The overpotential of the catalyst-coated NiFelt decreased by 108 mV at 10 mA/cm2 compared to bare NiFelt, showing a good potential for its application in anion exchange membranes and alkaline electrolyzers at an industrial scale.</description>

      <title>The Modification of Aluminum Oxide Inclusions in Bearing Steel under Different Cleanliness Conditions by Rare Earth Elements</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/met14080861</link>
      <description>Ning Wang, Wen-zhi Xia, Yun Zhou, Aijun Deng, Guang-da Bao, Zhiyou Liao, Haichuan Wang, Metals. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401014801

                The impact of rare earth treatment on the chemical morphology evolution of non-metallic inclusions in bearing steel under different initial cleanliness conditions was studied through simulation. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that at an oxygen content of 0.001%, the evolution route of inclusions with increasing Ce content was Al2O3 &#8594; CeAl11O18 + CeAlO3 &#8594; CeAlO3 + Ce2O2S &#8594; Ce2O2S &#8594; Ce2O2S + CeS. As the initial oxygen content decreases, the proportion of CeAlO3 decreases, leading to easier conversion of CeAlO3 to Ce2O2S. Vacuum induction furnace experiments demonstrated that with an oxygen content of 0.001%, an increase in Ce content results in a gradual rise in the proportion of inclusions in steel sized 1~2 &#956;m. In contrast, the proportion of inclusions sized 2~5 &#956;m decreases. Consequently, the overall content of inclusions in steel decreases, along with a reduction in both the number density and average size of inclusions. Introducing bearing steel melt with approximately 0.01% Ce rare earth to bearing steel with initial oxygen contents of 0.0005%, 0.001%, and 0.0015% showed an evolution of inclusions from Ce2O2S and CeS to Ce2O3, CeAlO3, etc. The average inclusion size significantly increased from 0.7 &#956;m to 2.16 &#956;m. Morphologically, the transition of inclusions from precipitated to polymerized forms occurred as the initial oxygen content rose. High-temperature laser confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that inclusions in low cleanliness conditions tend to agglomerate more than those in high cleanliness conditions, contributing to the increase in average size.</description>

                Abstract Analyzing laser-produced plasmas (LPP) in a controlled oxygen-containing environment provides insight into the formation and evolution of molecular species through gas-phase oxidation. This study explores the role of ambient pressure and oxygen availability in forming SiO molecular species in laser ablation plumes. The self-emission emanating during the reactive ablation of Si targets was characterized by optical emission spectroscopy and optical time-of-flight techniques. Our results showed that the SiO species formation was greatly influenced by both the ambient pressure and oxygen availability. The intensity and the persistence of SiO emission bands are lower at higher oxygen concentrations, indicating they are depopulated by the formation of more complex silicon oxides. The oxygen partial pressure effects on plume chemistry showed that SiO formation is favored even with a minimal oxygen concentration in the environment.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>

                High-voltage ultrahigh-Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2, x &#8805; 0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost-effectiveness of Li-ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li-Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high-voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li-Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li-Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high-voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh-Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li-Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5 V cycling stability.</description>

      <title>Unique myoglobin adaptation to endothermy and flight since the origin of birds</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12870</link>
      <description>Shengjing Song, H. D. Chen, Yu Zhang, Xiaojia Zhu, David M. Irwin, Kai He, Yang Liu, Integrative Zoology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401006652

                Myoglobin (Mb) mediates oxygen diffusion and storage in muscle tissue and thus is important for the energy utilization and activity of animals. Birds generally have a high body temperature, and most species also possess the capability of powered flight. Both of these require high levels of aerobic metabolism. Within endothermic mammals, bats also independently evolved flight. Although the functional evolution of myoglobins in deep-diving amniote vertebrates has been well-studied, the functional evolution of myoglobin since the origins of both birds and bats is unclear. Here, with Mb-coding sequences from &gt;200 extant amniote species, we reconstructed ancestral sequences to estimate the functional properties of myoglobin through amniote evolution. A dramatic change in net surface charge on myoglobin occurred during the origin of Aves, which might have been driven by positively selected amino acid substitutions that occurred on the lineage leading to all birds. However, in bats, no change in net surface charge occurred and instead, the Mb genes show evidence of strong purifying selection. The increased net surface charge on bird myoglobins implies an adaptation to flight-related endothermic and higher body temperatures, possibly by reducing harmful protein aggregations. Different from the findings of net surface charge, myoglobins of extant birds show lower stability compared with other amniotes, which probably accelerates the rate of oxygen utilization in muscles. In bats and other mammals, higher stability of Mb may be an alternative pathway for adaptation to endothermy, indicating divergent evolution of myoglobin in birds and bats.</description>

      <title>Divergent molecular strategies drive evolutionary adaptation to competitive fitness in biofilm formation</title>

                Abstract Biofilm is a group of heterogeneously structured and densely packed bacteria with limited access to nutrients and oxygen. These intrinsic features can allow a mono-species biofilm to diversify into polymorphic subpopulations, determining the overall community&#8217;s adaptive capability to changing ecological niches. However, the specific biological functions underlying biofilm diversification and fitness adaptation are poorly demonstrated. Here, we launched and monitored the experimental evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, finding that two divergent molecular trajectories were adopted for adaptation to higher competitive fitness in biofilm formation: one involved hijacking bacteriophage superinfection to aggressively inhibit kin competitors, whereas the other induced a subtle change in c-di-GMP signaling to gain a positional advantage via enhanced early biofilm adhesion. Bioinformatics analyses implicated that similar evolutionary strategies were prevalent among clinical P. aeruginosa strains, indicative of parallelism between natural and experimental evolution. Divergence in the molecular bases illustrated the adaptive values of genomic plasticity for gaining competitive fitness in biofilm formation. Finally, we demonstrated that these fitness-adaptive mutations reduced bacterial virulence. Our findings revealed how the mutations intrinsically generated from the biofilm environment influence the evolution of P. aeruginosa.</description>

                The influences of the microstructure evolution and oxidation behaviour of Hf-modified Mo&#8211;12Si&#8211;12B alloys were systematically studied at 800 &#176;C and 1100 &#176;C. Vickers hardness tests show that the Hf addition increases the hardness of Mo&#8211;Si&#8211;B&#8211;Hf alloys. The oxidation experiments were conducted at 800 &#176;C and 1100 &#176;C for 12 h; the detailed analysis revealed that the formation of HfSiO 4 in Mo&#8211;12Si&#8211;12B&#8211;10Hf alloy can effectively decrease the content of oxygen and make the surface of the oxide layer more complete at 800 &#176;C. At 1100&#176;C, the distinct difference in the expansion coefficient among the oxide films results in the formation of cracks and holes in Mo&#8211;12Si&#8211;12B&#8211;10Hf alloy, so the Mo&#8211;12Si&#8211;12B&#8211;10Hf alloy shows poor oxidation resistance.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits: expanding the temperature tolerance of a coral photosymbiont through differing selection regimes</title>

                Coral thermal bleaching resilience can be improved by enhancing photosymbiont thermal tolerance via experimental evolution. While successful for some strains, selection under stable temperatures was ineffective at increasing the thermal threshold of an already thermo-tolerant photosymbiont (Durusdinium trenchii). Corals from environments with fluctuating temperatures tend to have comparatively high heat tolerance. Therefore, we investigated whether exposure to temperature oscillations can raise the upper thermal limit of D. trenchii. We exposed a D. trenchii strain to stable and fluctuating temperature profiles, which varied in oscillation frequency. After 2.1 yr (54-73 generations), we characterised the adaptive responses under the various experimental evolution treatments by constructing thermal performance curves of growth from 21 to 31&#176;C for the heat-evolved and wild-type lineages. Additionally, the accumulation of extracellular reactive oxygen species, photophysiology, photosynthesis and respiration rates were assessed under increasing temperatures. Of the fluctuating temperature profiles investigated, selection under the most frequent oscillations (diurnal) induced the greatest widening of D. trenchii's thermal niche. Continuous selection under elevated temperatures induced the only increase in thermal optimum and a degree of generalism. Our findings demonstrate how differing levels of thermal homogeneity during selection drive unique adaptive responses to heat in a coral photosymbiont.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Surface Magnetic Dead Layer in Rare&#8208;Earth Titanates</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202400489</link>
      <description>Rapha&#235;l Aeschlimann, Manuel Bib&#232;s, Alexandre Gloter, Advanced Materials Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401038578

                Abstract Perovskite rare&#8208;earth titanates RTiO 3 display a rich array of magnetic and electronic properties, with a Mott&#8208;insulating ground state and ferro&#8208; or antiferromagnetic spin orders depending on the rare&#8208;earth R. The nominal Ti valence is 3+ with a corresponding 3 d 1 configuration. Yet, at the surface of both bulk and thin films of RTiO 3 , the Ti valence has been found to strongly deviate towards the more stable 4+ state, adversely affecting magnetic properties. While this finding is rather ubiquitous, its exact origin is still poorly understood, which hampers the integration of RTiO 3 into complex heterostructures harnessing their rich physics. Here, scanning transmission electron microscope and electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments are used to analyze the top part of an epitaxial DyTiO 3 thin film displaying a well&#8208;developed Ti 4+ &#8208;rich layer over several nanometres. It shows that this valence evolution is related to a combination of short&#8208;range ordered interstitial oxygen planes and Ti&#8208;Dy cationic imbalance. Both defects synergistically contribute to enough hole doping for a complete transition toward Ti 4+ over a few unit&#8208;cells from the surface while a structure primarily of the perovskite&#8208;type is maintained.</description>

      <title>Emerging insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies for vascular endothelial injury-associated diseases: focus on mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-024-09938-4</link>
      <description>Boxian Pang, Guangtong Dong, Tieliang Pang, Xinyao Sun, Xin Liu, Yifeng Nie, Xing Chang, Angiogenesis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401010620

                As a vital component of blood vessels, endothelial cells play a key role in maintaining overall physiological function by residing between circulating blood and semi-solid tissue. Various stress stimuli can induce endothelial injury, leading to the onset of corresponding diseases in the body. In recent years, the importance of mitochondria in vascular endothelial injury has become increasingly apparent. Mitochondria, as the primary site of cellular aerobic respiration and the organelle for "energy information transfer," can detect endothelial cell damage by integrating and receiving various external stress signals. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction often determine the evolution of endothelial cell injury towards necrosis or apoptosis. Therefore, mitochondria are closely associated with endothelial cell function, helping to determine the progression of clinical diseases. This article comprehensively reviews the interconnection and pathogenesis of mitochondrial-induced vascular endothelial cell injury in cardiovascular diseases, renal diseases, pulmonary-related diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and microvascular diseases associated with diabetes. Corresponding therapeutic approaches are also provided. Additionally, strategies for using clinical drugs to treat vascular endothelial injury-based diseases are discussed, aiming to offer new insights and treatment options for the clinical diagnosis of related vascular injuries.</description>

      <title>First Detection of CO Isotopologues in a High-redshift Main-sequence Galaxy: Evidence of a Top-heavy Stellar Initial Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4da2</link>
      <description>Ziyi Guo, Zhi-Yu Zhang, Zhiqiang Yan, Eda Gjergo, Allison Man, R. J. Ivison, X. Fu, Yong Shi, The Astrophysical Journal. 970(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400999003

                Abstract Recent observations and theories have presented a strong challenge to the universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in extreme environments. A notable example has been found for starburst conditions, where evidence favors a top-heavy IMF, i.e., there is a bias toward massive stars compared to the IMF that is responsible for the stellar mass function and elemental abundances observed in the Milky Way. Local starburst galaxies have star formation rates similar to those in high-redshift main-sequence galaxies, which appear to dominate the stellar mass budget at early epochs. However, the IMF of high-redshift main-sequence galaxies is yet to be probed. Since 13 CO and C 18 O isotopologues are sensitive to the IMF, we have observed these lines toward four strongly lensed high-redshift main-sequence galaxies using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Of our four targets, SDSS J0901+1814, at z &#8776; 2.26, is seen clearly in 13 CO and C 18 O, the first detection of CO isotopologues in the high-redshift main-sequence galaxy population. The observed 13 C/ 18 O ratio, 2.4 &#177; 0.8, is significantly lower than that of local main-sequence galaxies. We estimate the isotope ratio, oxygen abundance, and stellar mass using a series of chemical evolution models with varying star formation histories and IMFs. All models favor an IMF that is more top-heavy than that of the Milky Way. Thus, as with starburst galaxies, main-sequence galaxies in the high-redshift Universe have a greater fraction of massive stars than a Milky Way IMF would imply.</description>

      <title>Genomic Evolution of Influenza During the 2023-2024 Season, the Johns Hopkins Health System</title>

                Influenza, a human disease caused by viruses in the Orthomyxoviridae family, is estimated to infect 5% -10 % of adults and 20% -30 % of children annually. Influenza A (IAV) and Influenza B (IBV) viruses accumulate amino acid substitutions (AAS) in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins seasonally. These changes, as well as the dominating viral subtypes, vary depending on geographical location, which may impact disease prevalence and the severity of the season. Genomic surveillance is crucial for capturing circulation patterns and characterizing AAS that may affect disease outcomes, vaccine efficacy, or antiviral drug activities. In this study, whole-genome sequencing of IAV and IBV was attempted on positive remnant clinical samples (587) collected from 580 patients between June 2023 and February 2024 in the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS). Full-length HA segments were obtained from 424 (72.2 %) samples. H1N1pdm09 (71.7 %) was the predominant IAV subtype, followed by H3N2 (16.7 %) and IBV-Victoria clade V1A.3a.2 (11.6 %). Within H1N1pdm09 HA sequences, the 6B1A.5a.2a.1 (60.5 %) clade was the most represented. Full-length NA segments were obtained from 421 (71.7 %) samples. Within H1N1pdm09 and IBV, AAS previously proposed to change susceptibility to NA inhibitors were infrequently detected. Phylogeny of HA and NA demonstrated heterogeneous HA and NA H1N1pdm09 and IBV subclades. No significant differences were observed in admission rates or use of supplemental oxygen between different subtypes or clades. Influenza virus genomic surveillance is essential for understanding the seasonal evolution of influenza viruses and their association with disease prevalence and outcomes.</description>

      <title>The origin and migration laws of hydrocarbons in uranium&#8208;bearing Luohe Formation, Pengyang area, &lt;scp&gt;SW&lt;/scp&gt; Ordos Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/gj.5017</link>

                The hydrocarbon activity in Pengyang area, situated in the southwestern Ordos Basin, is notably prominent. Investigation on the migration laws of hydrocarbons is imperative for comprehending the involvement in uranium mineralization. Based on the analysis of spatial distribution of hydrocarbon containing fluid and hydrocarbon generation conditions of sandstone in the Luohe Formation, the organic geochemical characteristics including hydrocarbon components, carbon isotopes and biomarker compounds were analysed. The research results indicate that: (1) hydrocarbon fluid activities in the Luohe Formation are predominantly observed in layers exhibiting higher uranium mineralization. The mudstone of the Luohe Formation had low organic matter content and low thermal maturity, which was not conducive to hydrocarbon generation. (2) Hydrocarbon&#8208;containing fluid in the sandstone of Luohe Formation not only contained reducing gases such as methane and hydrogen but also chloroform asphalt components. The carbon isotopes of hydrocarbon in sandstone inform Luohe Formation resemble oil and gas in the Mesozoic. The biomarker parameter inferred that the parent rock of hydrocarbons in the Luohe Formation was formed under reducing and freshwater conditions, and hydrocarbon generation occurred at the mature stage. As above mentioned, a comparison was carried out between the affinity of hydrocarbon&#8208;containing fluid in the Luohe Formation and different layers of hydrocarbon source rocks. The migration behaviour of hydrocarbon&#8208;containing fluid in the Pengyang area has been summarized, and the involvement of hydrocarbon&#8208;containing fluid in uranium mineralization has been discussed. The main concepts are as follows: the sedimentary environment and thermal evolution conditions of hydrocarbons in the sandstone of Luohe Formation resemble those of the primary hydrocarbon source rocks in the Yanchang Formation. The main hydrocarbon charging events in the Luohe Formation occurred before the Late Cretaceous period, which is primarily related to two hydrocarbon generation events from 130 to 100 Ma in the Yanchang Formation and fault conduits connecting the Triassic to the Cretaceous Strata. The hydrocarbon&#8208;containing fluid released from Yanchang Formation migrating to the Luohe Formation provides reducing conditions for the precipitation of uranium in oxygen&#8208;bearing water bodies.</description>

      <title>Lithium Ions as Modulators of Complex Biological Processes: The Conundrum of Multiple Targets, Responsiveness and Non-Responsiveness, and the Potential to Prevent or Correct Dysregulation of Systems during Aging and in Disease</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/biom14080905</link>
      <description>David A. Hart, Biomolecules. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400980549

                Lithium is one of the lightest elements on Earth and it has been in the environment since the formation of the galaxy. While a common element, it has not been found to be an essential element in biological processes, ranging from single cell organisms to Homo sapiens. Instead, at an early stage of evolution, organisms committed to a range of elements such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron to serve essential functions. Such ions serve critical functions in ion channels, as co-factors in enzymes, as a cofactor in oxygen transport, in DNA replication, as a storage molecule in bone and liver, and in a variety of other roles in biological processes. While seemingly excluded from a major essential role in such processes, lithium ions appear to be able to modulate a variety of biological processes and &#8220;correct&#8221; deviation from normal activity, as a deficiency of lithium can have biological consequences. Lithium salts are found in low levels in many foods and water supplies, but the effectiveness of Li salts to affect biological systems came to recent prominence with the work of Cade, who reported that administrating Li salts calmed guinea pigs and was subsequently effective at relatively high doses to &#8220;normalize&#8221; a subset of patients with bipolar disorders. Because of its ability to modulate many biological pathways and processes (e.g., cyclic AMP, GSK-3beta, inositol metabolism, NaK ATPases, neuro processes and centers, immune-related events, respectively) both in vitro and in vivo and during development and adult life, Li salts have become both a useful tool to better understand the molecular regulation of such processes and to also provide insights into altered biological processes in vivo during aging and in disease states. While the range of targets for lithium action supports its possible role as a modulator of biological dysregulation, it presents a conundrum for researchers attempting to elucidate its specific primary target in different tissues in vivo. This review will discuss aspects of the state of knowledge regarding some of the systems that can be influenced, focusing on those involving neural and autoimmunity as examples, some of the mechanisms involved, examples of how Li salts can be used to study model systems, as well as suggesting areas where the use of Li salts could lead to additional insights into both disease mechanisms and natural processes at the molecular and cell levels. In addition, caveats regarding lithium doses used, the strengths and weaknesses of rodent models, the background genetics of the strain of mice or rats employed, and the sex of the animals or the cells used, are discussed. Low-dose lithium may have excellent potential, alone or in combination with other interventions to prevent or alleviate aging-associated conditions and disease progression.</description>
