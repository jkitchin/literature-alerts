                Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis has emerged as a highly promising technology for sustainable hydrogen (H2) production, but its widespread application relies heavily on the development of high-performance and cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Currently, noble-metal-based materials (such as Pt and Ir/Ru oxides) serve as benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER in acidic environments, but their high cost and limited availability pose major challenges toward industrialization. Low-cost noble-metal-free metal oxides are an important class of functional materials with rich compositions and structures, offering flexible electronic and crystal structures with tunable physical and chemical properties. In this Review, we present a comprehensive and timely summary of the remarkable progress achieved in the field of noble-metal-free metal oxides for catalyzing acidic HER and OER. First, we provide a brief description of the fundamental concepts of HER and OER in acidic media, including mechanisms, computational activity descriptors, and experimental parameters that are utilized for the evaluation of catalytic performance. Second, an overview is provided covering various types of noble-metal-free metal oxides for HER and OER in acidic media reported so far (e.g., simple transition metal oxides, spinel oxides, rutile antimonate oxides, perovskite oxides, specially structured metal oxides, and mixed-metal-oxide composites), with a focus on the designed strategies for enhancing performance and establishing correlations between properties and activity. Lastly, the challenges and future research directions regarding acidic HER and OER are summarized and discussed.</description>

                Abstract Guided by the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions is of paramount importance. A unique; tremella-like LaNiO 3 -NiO composite has been fabricated through a simple and robust procedure. This material stands out as an effective catalyst in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), showcasing its potential to enhance the efficiency of electrochemical energy transformations. This composite exhibits a remarkably low overpotential of only 383 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , coupled with a Tafel slope of 76.66 mV dec -1 . Furthermore, it boasts the capability to sustain continuous operation for more than 30 h at a current density of 20 mA cm -2 . The unique morphology of the catalyst expands the electrochemically active surface area, providing more available active sites to improve catalytic performance. This discovery presents a promising opportunity for the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for OER.</description>

                Developing a bifunctional electrode material for efficient energy storage and an effective electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains of significant scientific interest. Here, the electrochemical properties of perovskite hydroxide CoSn(OH)6 (CTH) and perovskite oxide CoSnO3&#8211;x (CTO) are systematically evaluated for their applications in asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors (AHSs) and as a catalyst for OER. Dunn analysis is employed to investigate the charge storage mechanism, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been employed to study the charge transfer kinetics and diffusion kinetics associated with both the CTH and CTO electrodes. CTH and CTO exhibit specific capacitances of 1414 and 681 F/g, respectively, revealing that CTH notably manifests superior electrochemical performance. The DFT calculations are performed to elucidate the interaction of OH&#8211; ions with Co and Sn octahedral sites in CTH. Furthermore, the performance of CTH is assessed in a two-electrode system, with CTH acting as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as the negative electrode. The constructed CTH//RGO system exhibits an energy density of 83.5 W h/kg and a power density of 461 W/kg, which is a promising performance for energy storage applications. Furthermore, the OER activity was examined, demonstrating CTH's superior electrocatalytic efficiency, making it an effective bifunctional electrode material for OER and AHS applications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Interfacial Material Design Leading Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis to Zinc&#8211;Air Battery Application</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.3c03031</link>
      <description>S.K. Tarik Aziz, Anshu Kumar, Mahendra Kumar Awasthi, Kothandaraman Ramanujam, Imran Karajagi, Vikram Vishal, Prakash C. Ghosh, Deepak P. Dubal, Arnab Dutta, ACS applied energy materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394727388

                The presence of an energy efficient and stable electrocatalyst capable of inflicting a bidirectional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital for the proper functioning of a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB). Here, we rationally combined ORR-active nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (N@C) around an OER-inflicting Ce-doped Ni&#8211;Co layered double hydroxide (LDH) to generate a unique N@C_LDH-CeO2 material, where all the segments operate synergistically to display bidirectional ORR/OER activity under analogous conditions. This multi-interfacial N@C_LDH-CeO2 material displayed exceptional energy efficiency, which was measured by its relatively low potential difference (&#916;E) of 0.74 V between the half-wave potential of ORR (E1/2) and the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 (Ej@10). This material was active in a ZAB assembly, achieving one of the highest reported specific energies (894.3 Wh kg&#8211;1 of Zn), appreciable power density (243 mW cm&#8211;2), and excellent specific capacity (698 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2), along with a remarkable durability of 270.0 h for 1600 continuous cycles. The tactical presence of N- and Ce-doping modulated the ORR and OER activity, respectively, as N@C_LDH-CeO2 displayed ample active sites during electrocatalysis on either side. This material remains active even in a solid-state ZAB assembly, where it successfully transduces energy to an electronic device.</description>

      <title>Scalable and economical production of oxygen deficient vanadium oxide with tunable vacancies concentration for bendable zinc ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234524</link>
      <description>Cong Guo, Rui Si, Yixiao Wang, Chengfei Qian, He Li, Jingfa Li, Journal of power sources. 605(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394733998

                Although vanadium oxides have high theoretical capacity and low cost, their practical application in aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is bottlenecked by sluggish diffusion kinetics and capacity decline. Herein, the oxygen-deficient V2O5-x&#183;nH2O (defined as VOd) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration has been obtained via an economic and scalable method. The introduction of oxygen vacancies not only provides extra sites for Zn2+ storage, but also reduces the electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ intercalation, resulting in enhanced capacity and cycling stability. As a result, VOd cathode with proper amount of oxygen defect exhibits a high capacity of 415 mAh g&#8722;1 and energy density of 294 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, estimating a roughly chemical costs of $64/kWH for VOd cathode. Besides, the VOd exhibits excellent stability at 20 A g&#8722;1 with average capacity decay of 0.004 % per cycle for 5000 cycles. Moreover, the bendable quasi-solid VOd//Zn battery maintains stable capacity of 200 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 even when repeatedly bending to straight angles. Therefore, the economical production of VOd cathode and construction of bendable quasi-solid battery provides a feasible way to boost the construction of efficient flexible energy storage devices and broadened application of AZIBs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering quantum characteristics of incipient evolutions at the
  photosynthetic oxygen evolving complex</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.07048</link>
      <description>Pei-Ying Huo, Wei-Zhou Jiang, Rong-Yao Yang, Xiurong Zhang, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394737148

                Water oxidation of photosynthesis at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) is driven by the polarization field induced by the photoelectric hole. By highlighting the role of the polarization field in reshaping the spin-orbit coupling deduced from the Dirac quantum mechanics, we reveal in this work the characteristics and underlying mechanism in the relatively simpler OEC evolutions within the states S0 - S2 prior to the water oxidation. The characteristic shifts of the density of states (DOS) of the electron donor Mn atom are observed in the vicinity of the Fermi surface to occur with the spin flips of Mn atoms and the change of the Mn oxidation states during the electron transfer. Notably, the spin flips of Mn atoms point to the resulting spin configuration of the next states. It is found that the electron transfer tend to stabilize the catalyst OEC itself, whereas the proton transfer pushes the evolution forward by preparing a new electron donor. Meanwhile, it shows that the Mn-O bonds around the candidate Mn atom of the electron donor undergo characteristic changes in the bond lengths during the electron transfer. These concomitant phenomena uncovered in first-principle calculations characterize the essential equilibrium of the OEC between the state evolution and stability that forms a ground of the dynamic OEC cycles.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an Electron Reservoir for RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxygen Evolution Catalyst in Acidic Media</title>

                Abstract Developing highly active and durable catalysts in acid conditions remains an urgent issue due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although RuO 2 has been a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial catalyst for OER, it encounters poor stability and high cost. In this study, the electronic reservoir regulation strategy is proposed to promote the performance of acidic water oxidation via constructing a RuO 2 /MnO 2 heterostructure supported on carbon cloth (CC) (abbreviated as RuO 2 /MnO 2 /CC). Theoretical and experimental results reveal that MnO 2 acts as an electron reservoir for RuO 2 . It facilitates electron transfer from RuO 2 , enhancing its activity prior to OER, and donates electrons to RuO 2 , improving its stability after OER. Consequently, RuO 2 /MnO 2 /CC exhibits better performance compared to commercial RuO 2 , with an ultrasmall overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and no signs of deactivation even after 800 h of electrolysis in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . When applied as the anode in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the cost&#8208;efficient RuO 2 /MnO 2 /CC catalyst only requires a cell voltage of 1.661 V to achieve the water&#8208;splitting current of 1 A cm &#8722;2 , and the noble metal cost is as low as US$ 0.00962 cm &#8722;2 , indicating potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Vertical Cross&#8208;Alignments of 2D Semiconductors with Steered Internal Electric Field for Urea Electrooxidation via Balancing Intermediates Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202401053</link>
      <description>Haiying Du, Huashuai Hu, Xunlu Wang, Nian Ran, Wei Chen, Hai&#8208;Liang Zhu, Yin Zhou, Minghui Yang, Yuandong Wang, Jianjun Li, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394683163

                Single-component electrocatalysts generally lead to unbalanced adsorption of OH- and urea during urea oxidation reaction (UOR), thus obtaining low activity and selectivity especially when oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes at high potentials (&gt;1.5 V). Herein, a cross-alignment strategy of in situ vertically growing Ni(OH)2 nanosheets on 2D semiconductor g-C3N4 is reported to form a hetero-structured electrocatalyst. Various spectroscopy measurements including in situ experiments indicate the existence of enhanced internal electric field at the interfaces of vertical Ni(OH)2 and g-C3N4 nanosheets, favorable for balancing adsorption of reaction intermediates. This heterojunction electrocatalyst shows high-selectivity UOR compared to pure Ni(OH)2, even at high potentials (&gt;1.5 V) and large current density. The computational results show the vertical heterojunction could steer the internal electric field to increase the adsorption of urea, thus efficiently avoiding poisoning of strongly adsorbed OH- on active sites. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-based electrolyzer with the heterojunction anode could operate at an industrial-level current density of 200 mA cm-2. This work paves an avenue for designing high-performance electrocatalysts by vertical cross-alignments of active components.</description>

                Water electrolysis is among the recent alternatives for generating clean fuels (hydrogen). It is an efficient way to produce pure hydrogen at a rapid pace with no unwanted by-products. Effective and cheap water-splitting electrocatalysts with enhanced activity, specificity, and stability are currently widely studied. In this regard, noble metal-free transition metal-based catalysts are of high interest. Iron sulfide (FeS) is one of the essential electrocatalysts for water splitting because of its unique structural and electrochemical features. This article discusses the significance of FeS and its nanocomposites as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and overall water splitting. FeS and its nanocomposites have been studied also for energy storage in the form of electrode materials in supercapacitors and lithium- (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The structural and electrochemical characteristics of FeS and its nanocomposites, as well as the synthesis processes, are discussed in this work. This discussion correlates these features with the requirements for electrocatalysts in overall water splitting and its associated reactions. As a result, this study provides a road map for researchers seeking economically viable, environmentally friendly, and efficient electrochemical materials in the fields of green energy production and storage.</description>

      <title>Modulating 3d Charge State via Halogen Ions in Neighboring Molecules of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Improving Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202400042</link>

                Abstract Modulating the coordination environment of the metal active center is an effective method to boost the catalytic performances of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, little attention has been paid to the halogen effects on the ligands engineering. Herein, a series of MOFs X&#9472;FeNi&#8208;MOFs (X = Br, Cl, and F) is constructed with different coordination microenvironments to optimize OER activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that with the increase in electronegativity of halogen ions in terephthalic acid molecular (TPA), the Bader charge of Ni atoms gets larger and the Ni&#8208;3d band center and O&#8208;2p bands move closer to the Fermi level. This indicates that an increase in ligand negativity of halogen ions in TPA can promote the adsorption ability of catalytic sites to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and reduce the activation barrier for OER. Experimental also demonstrates that F&#9472;FeNi&#8208;MOFs exhibit the highest catalytic activity with an ultralow overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , outperforming most otate&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe/Co/Ni&#8208;based MOFs catalysts, and the enhanced mass activity by seven times compared with that for the sample before ligands engineering. This work opens a new avenue for the realization of the modulation of NiFe&#9472;O bonding by halogen ion in TPA and improves the OER performance of MOFs.</description>

                Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) is a green and environmentally friendly ammonia production method, which is expected to replace the conventional Haber-Bosch process. In this paper, a Bi2MoO6 electrocatalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies was obtained by solvothermal method and sodium hydroxide etching treatment. The introduction of oxygen vacancies increased the active site of the catalyst and promoted the charge transfer and N2 adsorption, which finally significantly increased the activity of the catalyst. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution at a potential of -0.2 V (vs. RHE), the Bi2MoO6 with oxygen vacancies obtained an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 16.51% and an NH3 yield of 13.18&#956;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, which is about 4 times that of bare Bi2MoO6. This study provides a new idea to improve the activity of the catalyst for NRR.</description>

                Due to the large specific surface area and the highly-exposed active metal centers, nickel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as one of the excellent functional materials for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Herein, we have construct uniformly distributed Fe2O3 particles within Ni-MOF nanosheets (Ni-MOF NSs) for enhanced OER performance. This electrocatalyst, prepared by a facile hydrothermal method, provides highly active Fe2O3 particles while preserving the framework structure of Ni-MOF for effective substrates diffusion. The optimal Fe2O3 doped Ni-MOF NSs deliver high stability in alkaline and exhibit striking OER performance with an overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 49.3 mV dec-1, outperforming the pristine Ni-MOF and most reported non-noble metal based electrocatalysts. The enhance catalytic activity of Fe2O3 doped Ni-MOF NSs is likely due to the introduction of Fe2O3 particles to facilitate the deeper transformation of Ni-MOF into active NiOOH species.</description>

                Most nonoxide catalysts based on transition metal elements will inevitably change their primitive phases under anodic oxidation conditions in alkaline media. Establishing a relationship between the bulk phase and surface evolution is imperative to reveal the intrinsic catalytic active sites. In this work, it is demonstrated that the introduction of Fe facilitates the phase transition of orthorhombic CoSe2 into its cubic counterpart and then accelerates the Co&#8211;Fe hydroxide layer generation on the surface during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the Fe-doped cubic CoSe2 catalyst exhibits a significantly enhanced activity with a considerable overpotential decrease of 79.9 and 66.9 mV to deliver 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 accompanied by a Tafel slope of 48.0 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1 toward OER when compared to orthorhombic CoSe2 and Fe-doped orthorhombic CoSe2, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe on the surface hydroxide layers will tune electron density around Co atoms and raise the d-band center. These findings will provide deep insights into the surface reconstitution of the OER electrocatalysts based on transition metal elements.</description>

      <title>Guided Design of Efficient Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Using Patent Analysis</title>

                The facile and rapid design of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts holds paramount significance for energy conversion devices, such as water electrolyzers and fuel cells. Despite substantial progress in catalyst synthesis and performance exploration, the design and selection processes remain inefficient. In this context, we integrate patent analysis with catalyst design, leveraging the scholarly research functionalities within patent analyses to aid in the design and synthesis of a NiFeRu-carbon catalyst as a high-performance OER catalyst. The results demonstrate that the NiFeRu-Carbon catalyst with low Ru loading (0.3 wt %) exhibits an overpotential of only 219 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 under alkaline conditions, and after continuous operation for 200 h, the overpotential only attenuates by 15 mV. The incorporation of high-valence Ru dopants elevated the intrinsic activity of individual catalytic sites within NiFe-layered double hydroxides (LDHs). During the catalytic process, the partial dissolution of Ru might lead to the generation of numerous oxygen vacancies within NiFe- LDH, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity and stability.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Corrosion Resistance of A630-420H Steel Exposed to NaCl Solution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/bpi/cicms/v8/11900f</link>

                The deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in marine environments presents multiple problems due to the premature degradation of reinforced steel. The corrosion of reinforcing steel exposed to seawater has received significant attention due to its widespread use in industrial and social infrastructures. This work aimed to study the corrosion of reinforced A630-420H steel when exposed to a 0.5 M NaCl solution. Although this carbon steel is the most widely used material for reinforced concrete structures in Chile, there is limited research on its resistance to corrosion when in contact with saline solutions. The electrochemical reactions and their roles in the corrosion rate were studied using linear sweep voltammetry, weight loss, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques. The experimental procedure was designed to examine the kinetics of the partial electrochemical reactions in A630-420H steel immersed in 0.5 M NaCl solution, with a focus on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and iron oxidation reaction (IOR). This analysis is unique as it used the superposition model based on mixed potential theory to determine the electrochemical and corrosion parameters. The outcomes of this study show that A630-420H steel has a higher corrosion rate than those of the other commercial carbon steels studied. This fact can be attributed to the competition between the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, which also depends on the environmental conditions, exposure time, stabilization of the corrosion products layer, and presence of chloride ions. Additionally, the results under mechanical stress conditions show a brittle fracture of the corrosion product oriented longitudinally in the direction of the bend section, where the presence of pores and cracks were also observed. The corrosion products after corrosion were mainly composed of magnetite and lepidocrocite oxide phases, which are in concordance with the electrochemical results.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis process of zinc&#8211;air batteries. Consequently, it is essential to develop cathode catalysts with both cost-effectiveness and high oxygen evolution activity. In this study, we synthesized the FeFFIVE-1-Ni two-dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets via a straightforward solvothermal approach and oxidized them in an air atmosphere. During the calcination process in an air atmosphere, the heteroatoms (O, F) within the FeFFIVE-1-Ni 2D MOF nanosheets combine with iron and nickel metal ions, forming FeOF and NiF2 compounds. The synergy between these compounds and the creation of surface cracks during calcination yield catalytic active power and catalytic active sites essential for the oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, the overpotential of FeFFIVE-1-Ni 2D MOF nanosheets calcined in air under alkaline test conditions (&#951;10 = 286 mV) was lower than that of commercial RuO2 catalysts (&#951;10 = 355 mV). This work presents an effective strategy for replacing noble metal catalysts such as RuO2 by simply treating fluorinated metal&#8211;organic frameworks.</description>

      <title>First Principles Study of the Structure&#8211;Performance Relation of Pristine Wn+1Cn and Oxygen-Functionalized Wn+1CnO2 MXenes as Cathode Catalysts for Li-O2 Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14080666</link>
      <description>Liangliang Zhu, J. Wang, Jie Liu, R. H. Wang, Ming Chang Lin, Tao Wang, Yuchao Zhen, Jing Xu, Lianming Zhao, Nanomaterials. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394764123

                Li-O2 batteries are considered a highly promising energy storage solution. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions at cathodes during discharging and charging, respectively. In this work, we investigated the catalytic performance of Wn+1Cn and Wn+1CnO2 MXenes (n = 1, 2, and 3) as cathodes for Li-O2 batteries using first principles calculations. Both Wn+1Cn and Wn+1CnO2 MXenes show high conductivity, and their conductivity is further enhanced with increasing atomic layers, as reflected by the elevated density of states at the Fermi level. The oxygen functionalization can change the electronic properties of WC MXenes from the electrophilic W surface of Wn+1Cn to the nucleophilic O surface of Wn+1CnO2, which is beneficial for the activation of the Li-O bond, and thus promotes the Li+ deintercalation during the charge&#8211;discharge process. On both Wn+1Cn and Wn+1CnO2, the rate-determining step (RDS) of ORR is the formation of the (Li2O)2* product, while the RDS of OER is the LiO2* decomposition. The overpotentials of ORR and OER are positively linearly correlated with the adsorption energy of the RDS LixO2* intermediates. By lowering the energy band center, the oxygen functionalization and increasing atomic layers can effectively reduce the adsorption strength of the LixO2* intermediates, thereby reducing the ORR and OER overpotentials. The W4C3O2 MXene shows immense potential as a cathode catalyst for Li-O2 batteries due to its outstanding conductivity and super-low ORR, OER, and total overpotentials (0.25, 0.38, and 0.63 V).</description>

                Introducing oxygen vacancies into Co-based oxides with different surface structures can significantly affect their coordination environments and electronic structures, possibly contributing to the variation of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Herein, the oxygen vacancies were introduced into Co3O4 cubes and truncated octahedrons to uncover the effects of facets (001) and (111) on the intrinsic OER activity of oxygen-defective Co3O4. The (001)-faceted Co3O4 cubes with oxygen vacancies exhibited a lower onset overpotential of 298 mV than that of multifaceted truncated octahedrons (335 mV) because of the sufficient lattice oxygen participation in the OER process. Theoretical calculations revealed that oxygen vacancy on (001) surfaces can upshift the O 2p band center and trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism while oxygen vacancy on (111) surfaces matched well with the absorbate evolution mechanism. This work offers a new insight for designing OER electrocatalysts by selectively introducing oxygen defects on well-defined crystal facets.</description>

                Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as one type of two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered increasing attention in the field of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent decades. To address the challenges associated with poor conductivity and limited electron and charge transfer capability in LDH materials, we have developed a straightforward one&#8208;pot synthesis method to successfully fabricate a composite material with a microstructure resembling cabbage, which encompasses NiFe&#8208;LDH and nanocarbon (referred as NiFe&#8208;LDH@C). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that the monolayer NiFe&#8208;LDH with a height of ~ 0.5&#8208;0.8 nm is uniformly distributed and closely bonded to the carbon support, leading to a significant enhancement in conductivity and facilitating faster electron and charge transfer. Moreover, the NiFe&#8208;LDH@C exhibits a substantial number of surface defect sites, which enhances the interaction with oxygen species. This dual enhancement in charge transfer and oxygen species&#8208;mediated transfer greatly improves the catalytic OER performance, which is further corroborated by theoretical calculations. Notably, the Ni10Fe6&#8208;LDH@C with the highest concentration of surface oxygen vacancies demonstrated superior water oxidation performance, surpassing commercially available RuO2 catalysts; an OER overpotential of 231 mV@10 mA cm&#8208;2 with a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec&#8208;1 was achieved.</description>

                Reasonable design of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficiency and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance to improve the reaction efficiency of Zn&#8208;air batteries, which is still a huge challenge. Here, we report a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) N&#8208;doped graphene network&#8208;supported cobalt and cobalt oxide nanoparticles (Co/CoO&#8208;NG), which can be in situ synthesized by inducing metal ions on metal plates via graphene oxide as an inducer. This 3D network structure and open active center show excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity under alkaline conditions, and can be used as an air electrode in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, with significantly better power density (244.28 mW cm&#8208;2) and stability (over 340 h) than commercial Pt/C + RuO2 mixtures. This work is conducive to advancing the practical application of graphene&#8208;based materials as air electrodes for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2024.111658</link>
      <description>Kaiqiang Zhang, Chao Ma, Zhulin Yuan, Peter C. Kong, Jilei Ye, Yuping Wu, Journal of energy storage. 88(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394779390

                The limited energy density resulting from the suppressed operating voltage of aqueous batteries presents a significant challenge when it comes to practical applications. To address this issue, various strategies have been proposed to expand the electrochemical potential window of aqueous electrolytes, with a primary focus on inhibiting the hydrogen and oxygen evolution. It is crucial to note that these reactions are closely linked to the pH values. Consequently, adopting a pH design that decouples the acidity of anolyte and basicity of catholyte proves to be advantageous in overcoming the thermodynamic limitations associated with water decomposition and achieving a wider electrochemical stability window. Fortunately, this approach of bipolarized pH values optimizes the redox potentials at anode and cathode, resulting in a lower anodic potential and a higher cathodic potential. This optimization leads to an increase in battery's working voltage. Embracing this concept holds great promises for developing portable high-energy aqueous batteries, thus facilitating their practical applications. In this review, we delve into the research surrounding this innovative electrolyte engineering technology. We aim to provide a clear definition, highlight its efficacy, addressing any remaining challenges, propose potential solutions, and present a roadmap for the portable implementation of multi-segment electrolyte technology.</description>

                Highly active transition metal nitrides are desirable for electrocatalytic reactions, but their long-term stability is still unsatisfactory and thus limiting commercial applications. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique and universal room-temperature urea plasma method for controllable synthesis of N-doped carbon coated metal (Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) nitrides arrays electrocatalysts. The preformed metal oxides arrays can be successfully converted into metal nitrides arrays with preserved nanostructures and a thin layer of N-doped carbon (N-C) via one-step urea plasma. Typically, as a representative case, N-C@CoN nanowire arrays are illustrated and corresponding formation mechanism by plasma is proposed. Notably, the designed N-C@CoN catalysts deliver excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability both in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). For OER, a low overpotential (264 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and high stability (&gt;50 h at 20 mA/cm2) are acquired. For UOR, a current density of 100 mA/cm2 is achieved at only 1.39 V and maintain over 100 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that the synergetic coupling effect of CoN and N-C can significantly facilitate the charge-transfer process, optimize adsorbed intermediates binding strength and further greatly decrease the energy barrier. This strategy provides a novel method for fabrication of N-C@ metal nitrides as highly active and stable catalysts.</description>

                Admitting that rare-earth (RE)-based transition metal oxides (TMO) are emerging as a promising catalyst for lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries, the understanding of their electrocatalytic mechanism and active sites remains ambiguous. In this study, CeO2 nanoparticles modified MnOOH nanowires (CeO2@MnOOH NWs) is prepared by a simple solvothermal method as highly effective cathode catalysts for Li-O2 batteries. The incorporation of CeO2 nanoparticles into MnOOH facilitates a robust interaction between the 3d electronic state of MnOOH and the 4f electronic state of CeO2 at the Fermi level (Ef). The strong electron interaction at the heterogeneous interface between MnOOH and CeO2 promotes internal electron transfer. Compared to pristine MnOOH, the prepared CeO2@MnOOH NWs exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity and improved electrocatalytic stability. According to experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) results, it is demonstrated that there is a slight negative shift in the d-band center of the Mn site, resulting in faster electron transfer rates and higher conductivity. This acceleration of charge transfer optimizes the adsorption strength of the oxygen-containing intermediate (LiO2), thereby promoting the kinetics of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and reducting the reaction over-potential. As a result, the electrochemical performances of Li-O2 batteries are greatly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the synergistic role of oxygen vacancy and Co dual-site pairs in MOFs-derived defect-engineered Co3O4 catalysts with a hollow architecture for photothermal OVOCs degradation: Formation of reactive oxygen species</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.127361</link>

                Herein, we developed a solvent regulation strategy with dual organic ligands to synthesize a series of Co-MOF-74 isomer derivatives as model materials that were investigated the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and photothermal OVOCs (methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate) degradation. As a result, the defect-engineered Co3O4-DIW-100 with hollow microsphere synthesized under an equivalent volume ratio of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol and H2O, can efficiently improve the photothermal catalytic conversions for methanol (97 %), acetone (96 %) and ethyl acetate (93 %) oxidation under Xenon lamp irradiation, compared with unremarkable Co3O4-M catalyst. Thanks to its hollow architecture, the optimal Co3O4-DIW-100 possessed the enhanced low-temperature redox capability and more exposed Co3+ and VO sites. Furthermore, DFT and EPR results revealed that the VO and Co dual-site pairs at surrounding structural defects synergistically participated in the generation of abundant ROS (O2&#8722;) through a specific O2 activation configuration (Co2+=O&#8211;O&#8211;Co3+). Meanwhile, light irradiation could induce the separation and transfer of charge carriers to accelerate the formation of O2&#8722;. The superior absorption of visible light derived from the narrow Eg value on Co3O4-DIW-100 can boost a higher light-driven temperature to perform the photothermal OVOCs oxidation. The formation and transformation of sectional key reaction intermediates, such as CH3COOH, CH3OH and HCOOH, were accurately identified and investigated by in-situ DRIFTS results on the methanol, acetone and ethyl acetate oxidation.</description>

      <title>Confined growth of Ultrathin, nanometer-sized FeOOH/CoP heterojunction nanosheet arrays as efficient self-supported electrode for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Self-supported electrodes, featuring abundant active species and rapid mass transfer, are promising for practical applications in water electrolysis. However, constructing efficient self-supported electrodes with a strong affinity between the catalytic components and the substrate is of great challenge. In this study, by combining the ideas of in-situ construction and space-confined growth, we designed a novel self-supported FeOOH/cobalt phosphide (CoP) heterojunctions grown on a carefully modified commercial Ni foam (NF) with three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous Ni skeleton (FeOOH/CoP/3D NF). The specific porous structure of 3D NF directs the confined growth of FeOOH/CoP catalyst into ultra-thin and small-sized nanosheet arrays with abundant edge active sites. The active FeOOH/CoP component is stably anchored on the rough pore wall of 3D NF support, leading to superior stability and improved conductivity. These structural advantages contributed to a highly facilitated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and enhanced durability of the FeOOH/CoP/3D NF electrode. Herein, the FeOOH/CoP/3D NF electrode afforded a low overpotential of 234 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 (41 mV smaller than FeOOH/CoP grown on unmodified Ni foam) and high stability for over 90 h, which is among the top reported OER catalysts. Our study provides an effective idea and technique for the construction of active and robust self-supported electrodes for water electrolysis.</description>

                Owing to the high cost of precious metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the production of highly efficient and affordable electrocatalysts is important for generating pollution-free and renewable energy via electrochemical processes. A facile hydrothermal approach was employed to synthesize hybrid mesoporous iron-nickel bimetallic sulfides @ P, N-doped carbon for the OER. The prepared Fe0.5NiS2@C exhibited an overpotential (&#951;) of 250 mV at 10 mA/cm2. This exceeded the overpotentials recently reported for surface-modified P, N-doped carbon-based catalysts for the OER in a 1 M KOH medium. Moreover, the Fe0.5NiS2@C catalyst showed a notable Tafel slope of 90.5 mV/dec with long-dated stability even after 24 h at 10 mA/cm2. The superior OER performance of the Fe0.5NiS2@C catalysts may be due to their large surface area, sheet-like morphology with abundant active sites, fast transfer of mass and electrons, control of the electronic structure by co-treatment with heteroatoms (e.g., P and N), and the synergistic effect of bimetallic sulfides, making them favorable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the Fe0.5NiS2@C catalyst exhibited strong H2O-adsorption energy. The enhanced OER activity of Fe0.5NiS2@C was attributed to its higher surface area, favorable H2O adsorption energy, improved electron transfer efficiency, and lower Gibbs free energy compared to those of the other proposed catalysts.</description>

      <title>Four Generations of Volcano Plots for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Beyond Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Steps?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.4c00048</link>

                ConspectusDue to its importance for electrolyzers or metal&#8211;air batteries for energy conversion or storage, there is huge interest in the development of high-performance materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Theoretical investigations have aided the search for active material motifs through the construction of volcano plots for the kinetically sluggish OER, which involves the transfer of four proton&#8211;electron pairs to form a single oxygen molecule. The theory-driven volcano approach has gained unprecedented popularity in the catalysis and energy communities, largely due to its simplicity, as adsorption free energies can be used to approximate the electrocatalytic activity by heuristic descriptors.In the last two decades, the binding-energy-based volcano method has witnessed a renaissance with special concepts being developed to incorporate missing factors into the analysis. To this end, this Account summarizes and discusses the different generations of volcano plots for the example of the OER. While first-generation methods relied on the assessment of the thermodynamic information for the OER reaction intermediates by means of scaling relations, the second and third generations developed strategies to include overpotential and kinetic effects into the analysis of activity trends. Finally, the fourth generation of volcano approaches allowed the incorporation of various mechanistic pathways into the volcano methodology, thus paving the path toward data- and mechanistic-driven volcano plots in electrocatalysis.Although the concept of volcano plots has been significantly expanded in recent years, further research activities are discussed by challenging one of the main paradigms of the volcano concept. To date, the evaluation of activity trends relies on the assumption of proton-coupled electron transfer steps (CPET), even though there is experimental evidence of sequential proton&#8211;electron transfer (SPET) steps. While the computational assessment of SPET for solid-state electrodes is ambitious, it is strongly suggested to comprehend their importance in energy conversion and storage processes, including the OER. This can be achieved by knowledge transfer from homogeneous to heterogeneous electrocatalysis and by focusing on the material class of single-atom catalysts in which the active center is well defined. The derived concept of how to analyze the importance of SPET for mechanistic pathways in the OER over solid-state electrodes could further shape our understanding of the proton&#8211;electron transfer steps at electrified solid/liquid interfaces, which is crucial for further progress toward sustainable energy and climate neutrality.</description>

                Currently, hydrogen production through water electrolysis stands out as one of the most promising methods. However, the efficiency of hydrogen production is limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction, which involves a four-electron transfer process. Therefore, the development of an efficient and durable anode catalyst is important to reduce energy consumption and increase the hydrogen production rate. Herein, the Mo-doped Ni3S2 nanopillar structures were successfully synthesized by hydrothermal process on nickel foam (NF). Subsequently, nanosheets of CoFe-layered double hydroxides (LDH) thin films were deposited to obtain the CoFe-LDH/Mo-Ni3S2/NF catalyst. Physical characterization results revealed polycrystalline properties of the CoFe LDH nanosheets, while a non-homogeneous interface was also formed with Mo-doped Ni3S2 nanopillars. The contact angle verified the excellent hydrophilicity, which allowed the rapid release of oxygen bubbles. In terms of electrocatalysis, the catalyst exhibited an overpotential of only 227 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and demonstrated remarkable current density retention after 100 h. The catalyst was also characterized by good retention of the current density at 10 mA/cm2. This work provided the strategy for designing efficient, inexpensive and durable catalysts.</description>

                The destabilization of a lattice structure during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most essential aspects for designing and realizing highly efficient electrocatalysts. However, the underlying mechanism of structural evolution or degradation at the microscopic scale on the electrocatalyst surface during the OER has not been elucidated because of the sluggish yet dynamic character of the reaction. To address this issue, the direct observation of the unstable electrocatalytic activity is necessary. In this study, we demonstrate that the structural destabilization of epitaxial cubic perovskite BaRuO3 thin films during the OER originates from Ba leaching, Ru dissolution, and oxygen vacancy. A thin film geometry is adopted to selectively visualize the structural decomposition at the well-defined sample surface. The cubic BaRuO3 thin film initially exhibits high OER activity, which drastically decreases even during the first cyclic voltammetry cycle and is completely lost after the first cycle. The OER activity loss is closely related to the generation of structural defects on the surface, indicating the absence of the Ba and Ru atoms. This study proposes the mechanism underlying the OER activity that can be extended to elucidate the structural destabilization in various Ru- and Ir-based oxide catalysts.</description>

                Summary Refreshing the record of the electrocatalytic activity for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis is the first priority of developing next-generation rechargeable zinc-air batteries. A &#916;E indicator to evaluate the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity has stagnated with a record of &#916;E &gt; 0.60 V for decades. Herein, a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is developed to afford an ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of &#916;E = 0.57 V and realize high-performance rechargeable zinc-air batteries. Specifically, atomically dispersed Fe-N-C sites and NiFeCe layered double hydroxides are integrated to afford a composite FeNC@LDH electrocatalyst, following the guidance of the data-driven analysis. The FeNC@LDH electrocatalyst demonstrates a record-breaking electrocatalytic activity of &#916;E = 0.57 V, far exceeding the state-of-the-art level by ca. 60 mV. Practical ampere-hour-scale zinc-air batteries are constructed with a capacity of 6.4 Ah and cycle under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions. This work affords a record-breaking bifunctional electrocatalyst for ampere-hour-scale zinc-air batteries in future application scenarios.</description>

                In this study, we employed a straightforward phosphorylation approach to achieve a dual objective: constructing c-a heterostructures consisting of crystalline Ni12P5 and amorphous FeOOH, while simultaneously enhancing oxygen vacancies. The resulting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, Ni12P5/FeOOH/NF, exhibited remarkable performance with current densities of 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in both 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + seawater, requiring low overpotentials of only 288 and 365 mV, respectively. Furthermore, Ni12P5/FeOOH/NF exhibited only a slight increase in overpotential, with increments of 18 mV and 70 mV in 1 M KOH after 15 and 150 h, and 32 mV and 108 mV in 1 M KOH + seawater at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 after 15 and 150 h, respectively. This minimal change can be attributed to the stabilized c-a structure, the protective coating of Ni12P5, and superhydrophilic. Through in-situ Raman and ex-situ XPS analysis, we discovered that Ni12P5/FeOOH/NF can undergo a reconfiguration into an oxygen vacancy-rich (Fe/Ni)OOH phase during OER process. The elevated OER activity is mainly due to the contribution of the oxygen vacancy-rich (Fe/Ni)OOH phase from the reconfigure of the Ni12P5/FeOOH/NF. This finding emphasizes the critical role of oxygen vacancies in facilitating the production of OO species and overcoming the limitations associated with OOH formation, ultimately enhancing the kinetics of the OER.</description>

                To produce green hydrogen in a cost-effective and efficient manner, the research on low-cost, high-performance electrocatalysts is both attractive and challenging. In this study, a heterojunction electrocatalyst containing V3O5 and FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles was introduced. The adsorption and activation of the reactants at the FeCoNi/V3O5 heterointerface are significantly enhanced. The overall performance of the FeCoNi/V3O5 catalyst is excellent, with an OER activity reaching 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, nearly 65 mV lower compared to the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding durability, remaining stable for 50 h under a constant current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations also revealed a synergistic effect between the FeCoNi alloy (referred to as FeCoNi) nanoparticles and V3O5, thereby enhancing the OER performance, consistent with the experimental findings.</description>

                Bifunctional electrocatalysts derived from earth-abundant transition metals are a promising substitute for noble metals in general water electrolysis, but their low activity and short durability limit their application. Herein, a nickel molybdate nanoparticles decorated on nickel foam (NiMoO4/NF NPs) electrode was fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method at three different time intervals (6, 12, and 24 h) and verified for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The constructed electrodes exhibited high OER activity in 1.0 M KOH with overpotentials of 315 mV, 290 mV and 320 mV for NiMoO4-6 h, NiMoO4-12 h, and NiMoO4-24 h, respectively. In addition, the NiMoO4-12 h electrodes displayed remarkable durability with a negligible reduction of 1.28 % at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for 200 h. This research work delivers a new pathway to improve the electrocatalytic behaviour of the catalysts by synergistically moderating the inherent electrical conductivity, efficient surface moieties, and surface reaction.</description>

      <title>Phosphorous and cations boost the electrocatalytic performances of Cu-based compounds for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions and overall water-splitting</title>

                Developing durable, effective and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for the advancement of water splitting as a solution to the energy shortage. In this study, nanospheres stacked into nanochains are successfully prepared by oxidative corrosive engineering, solvothermal, and following calcination process (Co-Cu3P/CF). The unique nanochain structure facilitates growing the specific surface area, thereby exposing plenitude active sites. The introduced phosphorus (P) and Co ions can alter the electronic characteristics of metal phosphides, not only can accelerate the electron transport of the catalysts, but speed up the reaction kinetics. Thus, the prepared Co-Cu3P/CF exhibits low overpotentials, with 240/84 mV, in alkaline media for OER/HER to attain 10 mA cm&#8722;2. In alkaline freshwater/seawater, the self-assembled electrolyzer needs only 1.51/1.58 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This work provides an approach for the preparation of high-performing and economical electrocatalysts.</description>

                Developing anodic electrocatalysts with superior activity and durability suitable for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a challenge to overcome. Herein, a layered Pb-(0.76 wt%)Ag/&#945;-PbO2/&#946;-PbO2 electrode modified with Ni-doped Mn5O8 particles (PA/PbO2-NMO) is successfully synthesized by a coprecipitation coupling with anodic codeposition process. The physical characterization demonstrated that the surface of electrode is composed by &#946;-PbO2 and portion NMO that embedded in the deposit. In addition, it presents a layer structure, in which PA serving as support, &#945;-PbO2 as the mid layer enforcing the adherence, and &#946;-PbO2-NMO function as active layer. Benefiting from the above unique layered structure, the as-fabricated PA/PbO2-NMO electrode with a layered structure exhibits the outstanding acidic OER performance (583 mV, 139.04 mV dec&#8211;1) at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.53 M H2SO4. Meanwhile, the responding accelerated corrosion life at 1.5 A cm&#8722;2 is up to 64 h, indicating its robust anticorrosion ability. As for the applied performance in zinc electrowinning simulation electrolyte (1.53 M H2SO4 + 0.31 M ZnSO4), the current efficiency of the PA/PbO2 electrode is promoted to 93.8 % after the modification with NMO. Moreover, the cell voltage and one-ton zinc energy consumption of the modified PA/PbO2 electrode are diminished by 14.32 %, 17.75 % compared with the industrial Pb-(0.76 wt%) Ag (PA) electrode. Therefore, this study offers a new horizon on the development of the anodic electrocatalyst for both strongly acidic watersplitting and non-ferrous metals electrowinning.</description>

      <title>Tracking activity behavior of oxygen evolution reaction on perovskite oxides in alkaline solution via 3-dimensional electrochemical impedance spectroscopy</title>

                Developing electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for enhancing the efficiency of electrochemical water electrolysis. Among potential candidates, certain metal oxides, such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCF), undergo structural transformations at their surface during OER operation, and the in situ-formed active layer enhances their OER activities. However, it is challenging to quantitatively evaluate the time-variant electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and inherent catalytic activity per surface area (area-specific activity) of the oxides. In this study, we utilize the 3-dimentional electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (3D EIS) technique to reveal the variations in the ECSA and area-specific activity of the perovskite oxides during OER operation in an alkaline solution. In BSCF, the diameter of instantaneous Nyquist plots decreases as the number of potential cycling in the OER potential range increases, contrasting with other perovskite oxides, such as La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8722;&#948; and LaCoO3. The fitting results of the Nyquist plots demonstrate that in BSCF, the ECSA significantly increases while the area-specific activity drops to less than half of its initial value during OER operation. Consequently, enhanced OER activity of BSCF mainly attributed to the increased ECSA rather than area-specific activity. This study demonstrates the utility of 3D EIS for tracking the ECSA and the area-specific activity of electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically Structured Graphene Aerogel Supported Nickel&#8211;Cobalt Oxide Nanowires as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29081805</link>

                The rational design of a heterostructure electrocatalyst is an attractive strategy to produce hydrogen energy by electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we have constructed hierarchically structured architectures by immobilizing nickel&#8211;cobalt oxide nanowires on/beneath the surface of reduced graphene aerogels (NiCoO2/rGAs) through solvent&#8211;thermal and activation treatments. The morphological structure of NiCoO2/rGAs was characterized by microscopic analysis, and the porous structure not only accelerates the electrolyte ion diffusion but also prevents the agglomeration of NiCoO2 nanowires, which is favorable to expose the large surface area and active sites. As further confirmed by the spectroscopic analysis, the tuned surface chemical state can boost the catalytic active sites to show the improved oxygen evolution reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes. Due to the synergistic effect of morphology and composition effect, NiCoO2/rGAs show the overpotential of 258 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, the small values of the Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance imply that NiCoO2/rGAs own fast kinetic behavior during the OER test. The overlap of CV curves at the initial and 1001st cycles and almost no change in current density after the chronoamperometric (CA) test for 10 h confirm that NiCoO2/rGAs own exceptional catalytic stability in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. This work provides a promising way to fabricate the hierarchically structured nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.</description>

                Phase transformation offers an alternative strategy for the synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional phases, allowing us to further explore their unique properties and promising applications. Herein, we first observed the amorphization of Pt nanoparticles on the RuO2 surface by in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the low energy barrier and thermodynamic driving force for Pt atoms transferring from the Pt cluster to the RuO2 surface to form amorphous Pt. Remarkably, the as-synthesized amorphous Pt/RuO2 exhibits 14.2 times enhanced mass activity compared to commercial RuO2 catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Water electrolyzer with amorphous Pt/RuO2 achieves 1.0 A cm&#8211;2 at 1.70 V and remains stable at 200 mA cm&#8211;2 for over 80 h. The amorphous Pt layer not only optimized the *O binding but also enhanced the antioxidation ability of amorphous Pt/RuO2, thereby boosting the activity and stability for the OER.</description>

      <title>Identification of Commercial Stainless&#8208;Steel Mesh Size for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

      <description>Yuda Prima Hardiantoa, Mostafa M. Mohamed, Md. Abdul Aziz, Zain H. Yamani, Chemistry - an Asian journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394841074

                The study examines the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic efficiency of various stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM) sizes in electrolytic cells. Stainless steel is chosen due to its widespread availability and stability, making it an economically viable option. The primary objective of this investigation is to determine the optimal stainless&#8208;steel mesh size among those currently widely available on the market. The classification of stainless&#8208;steel mesh sizes as SS304 is confirmed by the minimal compositional variations observed across all mesh sizes through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X&#8208;ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses. Remarkably, CV experiments carried out at different scan rates indicate that SSM 200 has the maximum specific electrochemical surface area (ECSA). As a result, SSM 200 demonstrates superior performance in terms of current density response and shows the lowest overpotential in the alkaline medium compared to other stainless&#8208;steel mesh sizes. Stability tests conducted under constant voltage further confirm the remarkable stability of SSM 200, making it an ideal anode for electrolytic cell applications. These findings emphasize the cost&#8208;effectiveness and high stability of SSM 200, presenting intriguing possibilities for future research and advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of inhibition of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II by lanthanide cations</title>

                The process of the interaction of La3+and Tb3+ cations with the Ca-binding site of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II samples depleted of calcium has been studied. The binding of cations to the Ca-binding site is irreversible and the bound cations cannot be washed out or replaced by Ca2+ cation. A feature of lanthanides to bind strongly to the Ca-binding site has been used to investigate if the bound Ln3+ cation has an effect on the high-affinity Mn-binding site of the oxygen-evolving complex. Therefore, in this work, hydroquinone was used for the extraction of manganese cations from the oxygen-evolving complex of the calcium-depleted photosystem II membranes with the Ca-binding site blocked by La3+ or Tb3+ and the activity of the high-affinity site was then examined using exogenous electron donors (Mn2+ + H2O2) and 1,5-di-phenylcarbazide. It was found that lanthanide cation bound to the Ca-binding site can significantly inhibit the oxidation rates of electron donors through the high-affinity Mn-binding site. The mechanism of the observed effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Structural Reconstruction Chemistry for Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Developing efficient and stable catalysts for energy conversion processes such as alkaline oxygen evolution reaction is one of the key measures to solve the energy shortage problems. During alkaline oxygen evolution, several electrocatalysts would undergo structural reconstruction from the pre&#8208;catalyst state to the real&#8208;catalyst state. The structural reconstruction may modify the quantity and characterizations of the active sites, thus affecting the configuration and adsorption strength of the reaction key intermediates, which directly influence the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts. Understanding the structural transformation chemistry is essential for the rational design of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. In this review, we have deeply discussed the role and regulation strategies of structural reconstruction. Then, on this basis, we described some characterization technologies to probe the structural reconstruction of catalysts during alkaline OER. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.</description>

                The combination of aqueous electrolysis, either for hydrogen generation or CO 2 conversion, with wastewater treatment offers an elegant way to tackle issues associated with our energy transition and the need for clean drinking water. However, it requires an anode capable of doing both the oxidation of the targeted pollutant and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as most pollutants are present in too low concentration to be practical for industrial electrolysis. In this study, we focussed on the oxidation of urea on Ni x Fe 100-x catalysts. These catalysts were prepared by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, a versatile and green technique to prepare electrocatalysts. Transmission electron microscopy of the nanoparticles indicates the production of monodisperse nanoparticles, with an average diameter increasing from 7.8 &#177; 2.8 to 19.7 &#177; 3.9 nm with a higher iron fraction. The composition could be controlled between pure Ni and NiFe bimetallic nanoparticles with up to 56 &#177; 3% of iron, by controlling the composition of the target. A brief optimisation of the electrode preparation (loading, catalyst-to-carbon ratio) yielded an optimum at about 30 &#181;g/cm 2 of catalyst with a catalyst-to-carbon ratio of 20:80. During the electrocatalytic tests, Ni was the best catalyst for urea oxidation, with a maximum peak current of 619 mA/mg. However, Ni 75 Fe 25 was the best OER catalyst, showing a peak current of 1150 mA/mg. The difference increased further during CA at 0.5 V, during which Ni 75 Fe 25 outperformed pure Ni by almost a factor of 3 after 30 min.</description>

      <title>Advancements in bifunctional catalysts for unitized regenerative fuel cells: exploring polaronic conduction and heterostructure designs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/ad3e8b</link>
      <description>Uma Sharma, Pardeep K. Jha, P. C. Jha, Prabhakar Singh, Journal of physics. D, Applied physics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394803094

                Abstract This study investigates the development and performance evaluation of a bifunctional catalyst tailored for unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs), capable of facilitating both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in fuel cell and electrolyzer modes. The primary challenge addressed is the creation of electrocatalysts exhibiting high activity and corrosion resistance for oxygen reduction and water oxidation at the oxygen electrode. A novel catalyst structure based on La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}O_{3}(LSFT),i.e., LSFT/ZnO/LSFT with a thickness of \sim2 &#956;m, is explored within an environmentally friendly medium. This catalyst demonstrates superior performance characteristics, including reduced overpotential in HER and enhanced stability during oxygen/hydrogen evolution processes in neutral medium. The study identifies the formation of interfacial polarons and polaronic charge modulation resulting from the incorporation of ZnO in LSFT, leading to multifunctional OER/HER behavior. Notably, the proposed interfacial small polaron mechanism offers valuable insights into complex interfacial phenomena and holds promise for applications in diverse heterostructures involving layered 2D materials and transition metal oxides. Moreover, the robust LSFT/ZnO/LSFT catalyst exhibits exceptional stability, maintaining for 168 hours of oxygen evolution at a constant potential of approximately 1.66 V for a current density of 1 A/cm&#178; in a neutral medium. These findings mark a significant advancement in URFC technology and present promising avenues for clean energy storage solutions.</description>

                Bidirectional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for renewable energy transduction via electrolyzers and fuel cell. Here, we present a protocol for harnessing the cobalt complex for bidirectional O2/H2O transformation in neutral water via electrocatalysis/photocatalysis. We describe steps for monitoring ORR and OER in neutral aqueous solution, measuring O2 concentration, and identifying the probable catalytic mechanism for ORR and OER. We then detail procedures for examining catalyst behavior under photocatalytic conditions in neutral aqueous surroundings. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Saini et al.1.</description>

                A strategic approach has been proposed for designing robust, high-performing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts tailored for saline water splitting. By employing a density functional theory (DFT)-based computational screening process, a set of promising dopants were identified from a range of 26 3d to 5d transition metals, with the aim of enhancing the activity and saline water resilience of the catalysts. The screening methodology was 3-fold, encompassing evaluations of OER energetics, chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) energetics, and chloride-corrosion energetics. The screening led to the selection of Sc as a promising dopant, which substantially elevated the performance of the NiFeOOH catalysts. This improvement was validated by an 87 mV decrease in OER overpotential at 100 mA/cm2 and a 100 h stability test under 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl conditions. This study contributes to the understanding of the alkaline ClER and chloride-corrosion mechanisms, providing insights into catalyst behavior under saline conditions.</description>

                It has been critical and challenging to develop non-precious transition-metal-based eletrocatalysts with low-cost and long-term durability for efficient water splitting. Herein, self-supported nitrogen-doped tungsten carbide on iron-nickel foam (N-WC@INF) with three-dimensional flower-like structure was prepared by a simple hydrothermal reaction followed by simultaneous nitridation and carbonization. The resulting N-WC@INF exhibits an overpotential of 103 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media and a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec&#8722;1, accompanied by a negligible loss of overpotential after 30 h consecutive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, N-WC@INF shows promising activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 224 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 22 mV dec&#8722;1.</description>

      <title>A non-consumable argon plasma anode for carbon-free electrochemical ironmaking</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2024.03.011</link>
      <description>Shuwei Feng, Junjie Zhang, Junli Xu, Mouhamadou A. Diop, Aimin Liu, Fengguo Liu, Xianwei Hu, Zhaowen Wang, Miroslav Bo&#269;a, Zhongning Shi, Materials today. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394757862

                Blast furnace ironmaking produces abundant CO2, and molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) attracts great interest in ironmaking due to its carbon-free emissions. However, the anodes are the key limiting factor, making them very challenging due to high temperature and the intensive oxidation atmosphere. In this respect, a non-consumable argon plasma anode for iron electrolysis is proposed as a new technological process. During electrolysis, argon ionizes anodically and forms Ar+, which will jet into the molten oxide electrolyte and react with the O2&#8211; complex anion from the electrolyte. Metallic iron is obtained by cathodic reduction, while oxygen evolution and argon regeneration occur in the electrolyte through 2O2&#8211;(complex) + 4Ar+ = O2 + 4Ar, demonstrating the workability of the argon plasma as a non-consumable anode for molten oxide electrolysis.</description>

                Development of non-precious metal electrocatalyst that can efficiently catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) simultaneously, is a great challenge. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are first conducted to explore the beneficial effect of NiSe2/NiS heterostructure on OER. Based on this, a series of nickel selenosulfides constructed by different amounts of NiS and NiSe2 are synthesized. Results indicate that Ni4&#8211;Se2&#8211;S2 with the NiS to NiSe2 ratio of 5.82/2.47 displays outstanding electrocatalytic activity for OER/HER, with overpotentials of 228 mV and 155 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer using Ni4&#8211;Se2&#8211;S2 as the anode and cathode exhibits a lower voltage than RuO2||Pt/C. Moderate ratio of NiS to NiSe2 achieves a balance between conductivity and surface area, which endows Ni4&#8211;Se2&#8211;S2 the best catalytic performances. Our results pave a way for the optimization of heterostructured catalysts.</description>

                The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is generally undesirable for advanced green hydrogen production through renewable energy unless the employment of efficient catalysts. Perovskite-type oxide materials have been recognized as promising alternatives to overcome the kinetic limitations of OER. Nonetheless, despite extensive research endeavors, the electrochemical activity and durability of versatile perovskite candidates still fall short of expectations. Herein, a novel perovskite cobaltite BaCo0.6Fe0.2W0.2O3-&#948; (BCFW0.2), enlightened by tungsten incorporation strategy, is proposed as a reliable electrocatalyst for OER. Characterization analyses unravel that the manipulation of tungsten substitution in BCFW0.2 leads to the formation of high-symmetry crystal structure and more reactive oxygen species, which in turn promotes favorable oxygen catalytic behavior. Accordingly, the BCFW0.2 catalyst exhibits significantly lower overpotential of 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkably smaller Tafel slope of 42.34 mV dec&#8722;1 relative to its un-doped counterpart, as well as considerable operational durability under various current densities. The mechanism of lattice oxygen activation in BCFW0.2 is also explored. This study paves a constructive avenue for the rational design of high-performance perovskite-based derivative catalysts.</description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Powered Hydrogen Production From Seawater Enabled by Trifunctional Exfoliated PtTe Nanosheet Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is proposed to be a promising approach to green hydrogen (H 2 ) production but its large&#8208;scale deployment faces challenges because of the anodic competing chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and high energy consumption. To address these challenges, innovative hybrid SWE systems have recently emerged, able to mitigate the interference of CER and substantially reduce the electrical energy needed. Herein, the preparation of 2D layered PtTe nanosheets (e&#8208;PtTe NSs) using the liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation method is reported, which show outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution (HER), hydrazine oxidation (HzOR), and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in seawater. Using e&#8208;PtTe NSs as trifunctional catalysts, two hybrid SWE systems are demonstrated: 1) a hydrazine&#8208;assisted acid&#8208;alkaline dual&#8208;electrolyte seawater electrolyzer enabled by a bipolar membrane (BPM&#8208;OHzSWE), which can simultaneously produce H 2 and generate electricity through harvesting the electrochemical neutralization energy and leveraging the advantage of the HzOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in terms of anodic potentials; 2) a hydrazine&#8208;assisted SWE system powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC), which can realize self&#8208;powered H 2 production. These novel hybrid SWE systems show substantial promise for energy&#8208;saving and cost&#8208;effective production of H 2 from seawater.</description>

                Glycerol oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolysis has emerged as a cost&#8208;effective way of co&#8208;producing green hydrogen and HCOOH. Still, preparing highly selective and stable nickel&#8208;based metal electrocatalysts remains a challenge. Herein, heterostructure Ni3N/WO3 nanosheet arrays of bifunctional catalysts with large specific surface areas loaded on nickel foam (denoted as Ni3N/WO3/NF) were synthesized. This catalyst was for glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with excellent catalytic performance, a voltage saving of 267 mV compared to oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a HER overpotential of 104 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The cell voltage in the assembled GOR // HER hybrid electrolysis system reaches 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.50 V, 296 mV lower than the potential required for overall water splitting. This work demonstrates that replacing GOR with OER using a cost&#8208;effective and highly active Ni&#8208;based bifunctional electrocatalyst can make hybrid water electrolysis an energy&#8208;efficient, sustainable, and green strategy for hydrogen production.</description>

                Traditional phase engineering enhances conductivity or activity by fully converting electrocatalytic materials into either a crystalline or an amorphous state, but this approach often faces limitations. Thus, a practical solution entails balancing the dynamic attributes of both phases to maximize an electrocatalyst's functionality is urgently needed. Herein, in this work, Co/Co2C crystals have been assembled on the amorphous N, S co-doped porous carbon (NSPC) through hydrothermal and calcination processes. The stable biphase structure and amorphous/crystalline (A/C) interface enhance conductivity and intrinsic activity. Moreover, the adsorption ability of water molecules and intermediates is improved significantly attributed to the rich oxygen-containing groups, unsaturated bonds, and defect sites of NSPC, which accelerates proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and overall water splitting. Consequently, A/C-Co/Co2C/NSPC (Co/Co2C/NSPC with amorphous/crystalline interface) exhibits outstanding behavior for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), requiring the overpotential of 240.0 mV and 70.0 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, an electrolyzer assembled by A/C-Co/Co2C/NSPC-3 (anode) and A/C-Co/Co2C/NSPC-2 (cathode) demonstrates a low drive voltage of 1.54 V during overall water splitting process. Overall, this work has pioneered the coexistence of crystalline/amorphous phases in electrocatalysts and provided new insights into phase engineering.</description>

                Metal-organic framework material is a porous crystalline material, which has a large specific surface area and porosity, metal-organic framework material structure synthesis and modification methods are abundant, so there are prospects for application in a number of aspects such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, redox, and so on. In this experiment, it was proposed that the electrocatalytic performance could be improved by reducing the organic ligand 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione to 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione alcohol, and then introducing metal particles to modify the organic ligand to improve the electrocatalytic performance, and molecular-scale catalysts were successfully prepared. The catalyst provides a pair of electrons through the organic ligand metal ions provide empty orbitals to form coordination bonds, which enhances the electron transfer from the ligand to the metal ions, thus optimizing the electronic structure of the catalytically active centers in the catalyst molecule, and so leads to an improvement in the electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst. The catalyst has a low overpotential (230 mV) for OER at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a high half-wave potential of 0.675 V for ORR, and the assembled cell shows a specific capacity of (391 mAh g&#8722;1) for the molecular-scale catalyst.</description>

                Improving the efficiency of overall water splitting (OWS) is crucial due to the slow four-electron transfer process in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The coupling of the thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) significantly boosts hydrogen production. A Ru-decorated MoNi/MoO2 micropillar (Ru-MoNi/MoO2) has been synthesized using a hydrothermal followed by reduction annealing. Benefiting from Ru moderating the active interface of Mo-based alloys/oxides and the unique one-dimensional micropillar morphology. The synthesized Ru-MoNi/MoO2 exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity for HER and HzOR, achieving 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at merely &#8722;13 mV and &#8722;34 mV in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH + 0.5 M N2H4, respectively. Notably, with Ru-MoNi/MoO2 in a dual-electrode setup, only 0.57 V is needed to achieve 50 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating good stability and facilitating hydrazine-assisted water splitting (OHzS). This work offers insights into the modulation of alloy/metal oxide active interfaces, contributing to the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts for HER and HzOR.</description>

                Graphene oxide is vital in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, serving as an essential photoanode material. Its semiconducting nature allows for the generation of photocurrents, promoting water oxidation at the anode and contributing to hydrogen production efficiency. Additionally, graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope that has quickly emerged as a highly promising material in PEC water splitting, potentially transforming renewable energy and sustainable hydrogen generation. Graphene improves PEC water-splitting efficiency by facilitating efficient charge transport, rapid electron transfer, and effective redox reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. It possesses high electrical conductivity, a large specific surface area, and excellent charge carrier mobility. Its unique band structure enables efficient light absorption across a broad spectrum, including visible light, resulting in better light-to-electricity conversion. Furthermore, the inherent catalytic activity of graphene speeds up the oxygen evolution process (OER), increasing water oxidation and aiding hydrogen gas production.</description>

      <title>Degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride by electrocatalytic oxidation using NiO@Co3O4/Ti electrode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.105242</link>

                Tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) belongs to a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics and is difficult to remove from the environment, posing potential hazards to human health as well as the aquatic environment. In this paper, NiO@Co3O4/Ti, a dimensionally stable anode with NiO as the core and Co3O4 as the shell, was synthesized using a hydrothermal method. XRD, XPS, and SEM were conducted for characterization, revealing a constant charge transfer between Ni and Co, with mainly trivalent Co acting as the oxidant. The electrochemical characterization showed that the NiO@Co3O4/Ti electrode had a high oxygen evolution potential and low charge transfer resistance. Furthermore, 94.26 % of TC-H (100 mg/L) was degraded in 60 min under the optimal operating conditions (voltage of 10 V, 0.25 M NaCl, pH 7.88). According to radical quenching experiments, the active species O2&#8722; played an important role in the electrocatalytic oxidation process. In addition, the electrode maintained good stability after several degradation experiments.</description>

                Abstract Photocatalytic water splitting using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is a promising approach for harnessing solar energy. However, challenges such as slow kinetic dynamics in the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and COFs' self&#8208;oxidation hinder its progress. In this study, an enamine&#8208;based COF coordinated is introduced with cobalt dichloride, CoCl 2 (CoCl 2 &#8208;TpBPy). The coordination of cobalt ions with bipyridines in CoCl 2 &#8208;TpBPy enhances charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration, leading to effective photocatalytic OER. Under visible light irradiation, CoCl 2 &#8208;TpBPy achieves a notable OER rate of up to 1 mmol&#183;g &#8722;1 &#183;h &#8722;1 , surpassing the reported organic semiconductor analogs. Additionally, CoCl 2 &#8208;TpBPy shows minimal nitrogen evolution compared to TpBPy and ethanol&#8208;treated TpBPy (E&#8208;TpBPy), indicating cobalt plays a pivotal role in improving charge utilization and minimizing photo&#8208;oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses revealed that Co(IV) species are key to the high OER efficiency. This work highlights Co(IV) species in the efficient OER and inhibiting photo&#8208;oxidation of CoCl 2 &#8208;TpBPy.</description>

                In recent years, alkaline exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM-WE) has attracted a lot of attention for its potential cost reduction compared to traditional electrolysis systems. Despite this promise, challenges related to efficiency and stability must be effectively addressed to fully realise the potential of AEM-WE. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of an AEM-WE single-cell including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in conjunction with the equivalent circuit model (ECM). For the first time distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis is performed on an AEM-WE cell, employing a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference electrode. Half-cell EIS measurements and subsequent DRT spectra are presented, clearly indicating anodic and cathodic half-cell reactions. The DRT analysis reveals five distinct loss mechanisms in the AEM-WE system. These include the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and ionic transport losses occurring within the catalyst layers. Through a systematic variation of the operating parameters we successfully allocate DRT peaks to their respective physicochemical origins. The findings contribute valuable insights into the electrochemical processes within the AEM-WE single-cell, offering a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and facilitating the target-oriented development of enhanced membrane electrode assemblies.</description>

                The construction of high-asymmetrical structures demonstrates significant potential in improving the functionality and distinctness of nanomaterials, but remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we develop a one-pot method to fabricate regioselective super-assembly of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) &#8212;&#8212; a PBA anisotropic structure (PBA-AS) decorated with epitaxial modules&#8212;&#8212;using a step-by-step epitaxial growth on a rapidly self-assembled cubic substrate guided by thiocyanuric acid (TCA) molecules. The epitaxial growth units manifest as diverse geometric shapes, which are predominantly concentrated on the {1 0 0}, {1 1 1}, or {1 0 0}+{1 1 1} crystal plane of the cubic substrate. The crystal plane and morphology of epitaxial module can be regulated by changing the TCA concentration and reaction temperature, enabling a high level of controllability over specific assembly sites and structures. To illustrate the advantage of the asymmetrical structure, phosphated PBA-AS demonstrates improved performance in the oxygen evolution reaction compared to simple phosphated PBA nanocube. This method offers valuable insights for designing asymmetrical nanomaterials with intricate architectures and versatile functionalities.</description>

                In the research and development of noble-metal free catalysts, copper-based materials such as copper selenite have shown interest as electrocatalysts to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic medium, however their Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is still unexplored. Therefore, we have performed the synthesis of cobalt doped copper selenite nanoparticles which can robustly and effectively do electrocatalysis for both the OER and HER in basic medium electrolyte. The novelty lies in the fact that microwave synthesis procedure utilizing oxidizing agent as a key precursor is entirely new, this particular material was never employed in water splitting and catalyst need very low amount of binder. The results revealed that cobalt doped copper selenite have a relatively lower starting potential and a higher current density due to the synergistic effects of a large active area, quick charge, mass transport, and a three-dimensional conducting path, having OER and HER overpotentials of 359 mV and 226 mV at 10 mA/cm2 current densities, respectively. We found a novel doped structure featuring porous surfaces and distinctive rice like morphology which facilitate an efficient electron transportation during the water splitting thereby illustrating an exceptional performance of this system along with rapid synthesis and lower costs.</description>

                Abstract Driven by the goal of establishing a fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;free and nuclear&#8208;power&#8208;free economy based on renewable energy, metal&#8208;air batteries are regarded as promising energy conversion and storage devices. Developing efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalysts for the air electrode of metal&#8208;air batteries is becoming increasingly important. In this work, 36 transition metal (TM) single&#8208;atom catalysts are designed based on MXenes Ti 2 CT 2 with different surface terminal atoms (T = O, S, Cl), and their ORR/OER catalytic activity and stability are evaluated by the density functional theory. Ni@Ti 2 CO 2 , Pd@Ti 2 CS 2 , and Co@Ti 2 CCl 2 are found to exhibit good catalytic activity with ORR/OER overpotentials of .54 V/.62 V, .59 V/.29 V, .44 V/.40 V. The aggregation behavior of three catalysts is estimated by comparing the average binding energy of one, two, three, and four TM atoms anchored on Ti 2 CT 2 . This work cannot only provide a theoretical guide to develop bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts, but also help us understand the effect of terminal atoms on the electronic structures and catalytic activity of TM@Ti 2 CT 2 .</description>

                Hydrogen is increasingly recognized as a critical energy source for the future. Transition metal nitrides hydrogen catalysts have found to narrow the d-band contraction effectively and alter the filling state of the metal, thereby modulating the metal-hydrogen bonding energy and enhancing both electrical conductivity and catalytic activity. In this study, V-doped cobalt nitrides (V&#8211;Co2N/CoN) with two distinct crystalline structures were successfully synthesized through the nitriding of V-doped cobalt bicarbonate (V&#8211;CoCH) as a precursor. The morphology and structure of the resulting materials were carefully optimized by adjusting the V doping amount and nitriding temperature. For hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the final product V&#8211;Co2N/CoN-1-400 only needs 47 mV and 230 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and works at 1.69 V to drive the overall water splitting for 10 mA cm&#8722;2, showing good stability performance without fluctuation for about 10 h. This work implies that V-doped cobalt nitrides can lead to enhanced water splitting catalytic activity. Our findings may illustrate the significance of V doping for improving electrocatalytic performance, and demonstrate the potential of CoV bimetallic nitrides as effective electrocatalysts, offering valuable insights for the further development of non-precious metal nitride-based catalysts.</description>

                La, Mn and Co-based materials with diverse compositions encapsulated in N-doped carbon materials were synthesized by an in-situ sol-gel method. The as-prepared materials were physically activated with CO2 giving as a result composites with excellent performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The composites were characterized by different physicochemical techniques revealing the importance of porosity created by CO2 activation. This crucial step increases the number of accessible active sites such as Co-Nx-C sites, Co/MnO heterointerfaces and graphitic N groups. Moreover, the formation of La2O2CO3 was detected to enhance electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance and it is active for ORR. Although the composite containing La, Mn and Co has less concentration of the highly active sites, its small particle size favour a better distribution of these sites. The Co-containing composites were tested as air-electrodes in a Zn-air battery and compared to commercial electrocatalysts. All composites showed a better operation in terms of higher cyclability and higher energy density which is a consequence of metal nanostructures encapsulation in N-doped porous carbon shells. Interestingly, the pure Co-based composite showed an outstanding performance related to the high concentration of the Co-Nx-C active sites that provide high activity and stability.</description>

                Abstract Bimetallic phosphides are considered as promising electrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To address the semi&#8208;conductor inherent low electronic conductivity and catalytic activity, a polymetal&#8208;chelated strategy is employed to in situ fabricate bimetallic nanophosphides within carbon matrix anchoring by chemical bonding. The employment of biomolecule polydopamine (PDA) efficiently anchors various transition metal ions due to its strong chelating capability via inherent functional groups. Furthermore, the chelation of multi&#8208;metal ion is proved to promote the formation of graphitic nitrogen. The bimetallic Fe x Co y P phosphides nanoparticles are intimately encapsulated in carbon matrix through in situ carbonization and phosphatization processes. When utilized in Zinc&#8211;air batteries, Fe 0.20 Co 0.80 P anchored within N, P co&#8208;doped sub&#8208;microsphere (Fe 0.20 Co 0.80 P /PNC) exhibit a maximum power density of 167 mW cm &#8722;2 and cycle life up to 270 cycles, with a round&#8208;trip voltage of 0.955 V. The mechanisms for catalytic activity passivation are ascribed to the etching of nitrogen and oxidation of phosphorus in carbon matrix, as well as the oxidation of the surface phosphide on the sub&#8208;microspheres. This study presents a promising candidate for advancing the further development of energy conversation catalysis.</description>

      <title>Coupling hole-transporting polyaniline layer with a cobalt phthalocyanine cocatalyst to boost photoelectrochemical water oxidation of bismuth vanadate photoanodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dyepig.2024.112150</link>

                Though bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) exhibits a promising potential as a semiconductor photoanode toward photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation, its PEC performance is still limited by the poor charge carrier transport and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics. Herein, the polyaniline (PANI) and cobalt coordinated-phthalocyanines (CoTcPc) were introduced onto the BiVO4 semiconductor substrate, constructing the integrated CoTcPc/nPANI/BiVO4 (n = 30, 60 and 90, n represents the deposition time for PANI with the unit of s) composite photoanodes. It is demonstrated that the PEC water oxidation activity of BiVO4 is significantly boosted by the incorporation of PANI and CoTcPc, stemming from the improved electron/hole transfer, enhanced charge separation efficiency, and accelerated carrier mobility and water oxidation kinetics. CoTcPc/60PANI/BiVO4 composite photoanode with the optimized compositions exhibits an enhanced photocurrent density of 4.03 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination, ranking among the best records reported recently. Furthermore, the roles of electrodeposition time to generate PANI are also distinguished through experimental studies. These results reveal the crucial role of engineering the hole transfer layer to optimize the semiconductor photoanodes toward efficient PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional bimetallic-codoped MOF-derived M@N-CNTs bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcato.2024.206929</link>
      <description>Lei&#8208;Lei Lu, Jingze Tian, Jianyu Zhou, Weijie Li, Junpeng Li, Qiang Tan, Xifei Li, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394746030

                The design and synthesis of low-cost and efficient non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pressing demand for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this paper, a range of metal@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (M@N-CNTs, M = Fe, Ni) materials were prepared by the typical solvothermal synthesis with Fe and Ni co-doped zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as precursors. The synthesized catalysts have a multidimensional structure of one-dimensional M-N-doped carbon nanotubes coexisting with carbonized M-N-doped dodecahedra, providing abundant catalytically active sites for oxygen, as well as multidimensional channels for mass diffusion and electron transport, thus exhibiting excellent catalytic activity and stability. The FeNi@N-CNTs-10 electrocatalyst possesses a half-wave potential of E1/2 = 0.92 V for ORR and Ej=10 = 1.46 V (&#951; = 230 mV) for OER in 0.1 mol&#183;L&#8722;1 KOH, which is superior to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C+ RuO2 (E1/2 = 0.82 V, Ej=10 = 1.61 V (&#951; = 380 mV)). Zinc-air battery loaded with FeNi@N-CNTs-10 presents a power density of 187 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and smaller voltage gap (1.0 V) than commercial Pt/C + RuO2 for &gt;1600 discharge-charge cycles at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The outstanding performance is due to the multidimensional structure, high graphitization carbon and complementary effect between FeNi and M-Nx moiety. The design of multidimensional structure with bifunctional active sites could be extended to other metal-air batteries.</description>

                The practical application of high-energy density lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries is severely impeded by the notorious cycling stability and safety, which mainly comes from slow kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at cathodes, causing inferior redox overpotentials and reactive lithium metal in flammable liquid electrolyte. Herein, a bifunctional electrode, a safe gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), and a robust lithium anode are proposed to alleviate above problems. The bifunctional electrode is composed of N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Co4N by in situ chemical vapor deposition self-catalyzed growth on carbon cloth (N-CNTs@Co4N@CC). The self-supporting, binder-free N-CNTs@Co4N@CC electrode has a strong and stable three-dimensional (3D) interconnected conductive structure, which provides interconnectivity between the active sites and the electrode to promote the transfer of electrons. Furthermore, the N-CNT-intertwined Co4N ensures efficient catalytic activity. Hence, the electrode demonstrates improved electrochemical properties even under a large current density (2000 mA g&#8211;1) and long cycling operation (250 cycles). Moreover, a highly safe and flexible rechargeable cell using the 3D N-CNTs@Co4N@CC electrode, GPE, and robust lithium anode design has been explored. The open circuit voltage is stable at &#8764;3.0 V even after 9800 cycles, which proves the mechanical durability of the integrated GPE cell. The stable cable-type Li&#8211;air battery was demonstrated to stably drive the light-emitting diodes (LEDs), highlighting the reliability for practical use.</description>

      <title>Construction of 2D/2D BCNS/Ti3C2 heterojunction with boron-doped g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 MXene for enhanced photocatalytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2024.114719</link>

                Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has attracted great interest in photocatalytic water splitting. However, the poor photogenerated charge carriers transfer and the insufficient driving force for oxygen evolution reaction limit its practical application. In this work, boron-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (BCNS) have been synthesized by calcining a mixture of g-C3N4 and NaBH4. The synthesized BCNS were then combined with Ti3C2 MXene using electrostatic self-assembly to construct a 2D/2D BCNS/Ti3C2 heterojunction. The resultant BCNS retained the original framework of g-C3N4, while the optimized band structure of BCNS induced prominently enhanced visible light absorption, accelerated charge carriers separation, and the increased driving force for water oxidation compared to pure g-C3N4. Density functional theory further proved that BCNS can enhance the driving force for photocatalytic O2 evolution. Moreover, the construction of 2D/2D face-to-face BCNS/Ti3C2 heterojunction was carried out to further enhance photocatalytic performance due to the intimate contact interface and the accelerated separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. As a result, the 2D/2D BCNS/Ti3C2 hetrojunction exhibited a dramatically improved photocatalytic water-splitting performance compared to pristine g-C3N4. This integrated engineering strategy, involving non-metal element doping and 2D/2D heterojunction construction, might provide a unique paradigm for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

                Searching for catalyst materials with high intrinsic activity for water oxidation holds the key to numerous clean energy technologies. Hydroxide semiconductors are electrochemically active to drive oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but suffer from poor electronic conductivity, restricting their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Here, a semimetallic hydroxide material was designed as efficient OER catalyst with both improved electronic conductivity and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. By cationic doping and anionic vacancy manipulation, the NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) semiconductor was turned into semi-metallic with two orders of magnitude lower resistivity. Consequently, the semi-metallic LDH (SM LDH) array electrode exhibited an intrinsically improved OER activity with a low overpotential of 195 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 40.9 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium, outperforming commercial RuO2 catalysts (316 mV, 99.6 mV dec&#8722;1) under the same test condition. In-depth Raman and first-principles calculations demonstrated that the enhanced OER intrinsic activity of SM LDH was associated with the high electronic conductivity, which promoted the formation and stabilization of high-valence metal sites in oxyhydroxide intermediates. These finding suggest semi-metallic hydroxides as an advanced electrode material with both fascinating electric and catalytic properties.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enhanced photochemical activity in visible light absorbing semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0199589</link>
      <description>Yamuna Paudel, Diego J. Chachayma-Farfan, Andrea Al&#250;, Matthew Y. Sfeir, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(14)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394813103

                Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an important research problem relevant to a variety of sustainable energy technologies. However, obtaining high photocatalytic efficiency from visible light absorbing semiconductors is challenging due to a combination of weak absorption, transport losses, and low activity. Aspects of this problem have been addressed by multilayer approaches, which provide a general scheme for engineering surface reactivity and stability independent of electronic considerations. However, an analogous broad framework for optimizing light-matter interactions has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we establish a photonic approach using semiconductor metasurfaces that is highly effective in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of GaAs, a high-performance semiconductor with a near-infrared bandgap. Our engineered pillar arrays with heights of &#8764;150 nm exhibit Mie resonances near 700 nm that result in near-unity absorption and exhibit a field profile that maximizes charge carrier generation near the solid-liquid interface, enabling short transport distances. Our hybrid metasurface photoanodes facilitate oxygen evolution and exhibit enhanced incident photon-to-current efficiencies that are &#8764;22&#215; larger than a corresponding thin film for resonant excitation and 3&#215; larger for white light illumination. Key to these improvements is the preferential generation of photogenerated carriers near the semiconductor interface that results from the field enhancement profile of magnetic dipolar-type modes.</description>

                The slow kinetics of electrochemical urea and water oxidation processes at electrode surfaces, which can be recognised as promising resources for pollution-free hydrogen energy production, motivate the scientific community to design and fabricate low-cost, high-efficiency electrocatalysts. Because the performance of electrocatalysts is dependent on their structural, morphological, and electronic properties, herein, the tuning of these properties of Fe3O4@Ni-Foam via phosphorylation and sulfurization, yielding iron phosphide (FeP@Ni-Foam) and iron sulphide (FeS@Ni-Foam), with nanoneedles (along with microstructures) and nanoflower-like morphologies, respectively, is investigated. Among all the prepared samples, FeP is found to be the most effective electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution process (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and seawater electrolysis. The overpotentials observed for OER, UOR, and seawater splitting are significantly reduced when using FeP as compared to other materials, with values of 207 mV, 133 mV, and 287.1 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The enhanced catalytic activity of FeP over FeS and Fe3O4 is attributed to morphological changes, improved electronic conductivity, and exceptional endurance. The theoretical studies reveal that FeP has a better density of states over the fermi level than FeS and Fe3O4, lowering the energy barriers for the OER and UOR processes and demonstrating significant catalytic activity towards these processes. This work demonstrates that phosphorylation and sulfurization treatments can alter morphologies and electrical characteristics, hence improving the catalytic activity of the materials.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous enhancement of charge transfer and surface catalysis through a polymetallic oxide cocatalyst on BiVO4 photoanodes for highly efficient and stable water oxidation</title>

                The rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER) always limits the high-efficient conversion of solar energy to green hydrogen fuels through photoelectrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting. The high catalytic overpotential and the instability of catalytic center are commonly regarded as the primary factors contributing to the low rate of OER, remaining to be a challenge in the field of water splitting. Herein, a polymetallic oxide cocatalyst (Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx) with well-defined electronic and catalytic properties is designed on BiVO4 photoelectrode for highly efficient and stable photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. The experimental characterization demonstrates that the dual-layer design of Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx can significantly optimizes the electronic property of MnOy and FeCoNiOx components, boosting the photogenerated charge transfer between Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx cocatalyst and BiVO4 photoelectrode. The density functional theory (DFT) simulation reveals that the Mo sites in Mo-MnOy layer can activate the neighboring surface Mn sites instead of directly serving as the catalytic center, thereby establishing these Mn sites as primary active centers for achieving stable OER. The developed Mo-MnOy/FeCoNiOx/BiVO4 photoelectrode exhibits a current density of 6.18 mA cm&#8722;2 with an excellent stability for 30 h at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation, exhibiting the excellent activity and durability. This work sheds light on design of high-performance multiple-component water-oxidation cocatalyst on photoanode.</description>

                Limited by the strong oxidation environment and sluggish reconstruction process in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), designing rapid self-reconstruction with high activity and stability electrocatalysts is crucial to promoting anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer. Herein, trace Fe/S-modified Ni oxyhydroxide (Fe/S-NiOOH/NF) nanowires are constructed via a simple in situ electrochemical oxidation strategy based on precipitation-dissolution equilibrium. In situ characterization techniques reveal that the successful introduction of Fe and S leads to lattice disorder and boosts favorable hydroxyl capture, accelerating the formation of highly active &#947;-NiOOH. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have also verified that the incorporation of Fe and S optimizes the electrons redistribution and the d-band center, decreasing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (*O&#8594;*OOH). Benefited from the unique electronic structure and intermediate adsorption, the Fe/S-NiOOH/NF catalyst only requires the overpotential of 345 mV to reach the industrial current density of 1000 mA cm-2 for 120 h. Meanwhile, assembled AEM water electrolyzer (Fe/S-NiOOH//Pt/C-60 &#176;C) can deliver 1000 mA cm-2 at a cell voltage of 2.24 V, operating at the average energy efficiency of 71% for 100 h. In summary, this work presents a rapid self-reconstruction strategy for high-performance AEM electrocatalysts for future hydrogen economy.</description>

                Despite the considerable efforts made by the community, the high operation cell voltage of CO2 electrolyzers is still to be decreased to move toward commercialization. This is mostly due to the high energy need of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the most often used anodic pair for CO2 reduction. In this study, OER was replaced by the electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol using carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles as an anode catalyst. In parallel, the reduction of CO2 to CO was performed at the Ag cathode catalyst using a membraneless microfluidic flow electrolyzer cell. Several parameters were optimized, starting from the catalyst layer composition (ionomer quality and quantity), through operating conditions (glycerol concentration, applied electrolyte flow rate, etc.), to the applied electrochemical protocol. By identifying the optimal conditions, a 75&#8211;85% Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward glycerol oxidation products (oxalate, glycerate, tartronate, lactate, glycolate, and formate) was achieved at 200 mA cm&#8211;2 total current density while the cathodic CO formation proceeded with close to 100% FE. With static protocols (potentio- or galvanostatic), a rapid loss of glycerol oxidation activity was observed during the long-term measurements. The anode catalyst was reactivated by applying a dynamic potential step protocol. This allowed the periodic reduction, hence, refreshing of Pt, ensuring stable, continuous operation for 5 h.</description>

      <title>Sulfurization-induced lattice disordering in high-entropy catalyst for promoted bifunctional electro-oxidation behavior</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.151234</link>
      <description>Jing Chen, Kexin Wang, Zimeng Liu, Xin Sun, Xiaodong Zhang, Fengcai Lei, Xiuyan Wan, Junfeng Xie, Bo Tang, Chemical engineering journal. 489(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394835914

                The electro-oxidation reactions (EORs) are key half reactions to achieve efficient hydrogen production via direct or assisted water electrolysis, and the development of bifunctional EOR catalysts could further broaden the field of utilization and thus realize simultaneous hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. In this work, we proposed a mild sulfurization approach to fabricate a high-entropy septenary NiCrFeCoCuMnZn sulfide catalyst with unique sulfurization-induced lattice disordering. The disordered lattice and high-entropy feature of the pre-oxidation-favorable sulfide catalyst synergistically lead to enriched active sites and improved intrinsic activity towards promoted activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Dynamic analyses of the catalyst in EOR operation reveals that the enrichment of high-valence active species, increased surface roughness and the in-situ formed SO42- ions adsorbed on the surface of the activated catalyst could result in promoted catalytic kinetics, and thereby leading to significant enhancement of OER and HzOR activity without degradation during long-term catalysis. The exploration of the high-entropy lattice-disordered catalyst could promote the hydrogen production via direct and hydrazine-assisted water electrolysis, and the optimization strategies with synergy of phase engineering, lattice disordering and entropy modulation could guide the design of advanced catalysts for energy-related applications.</description>

                Water is the most convenient and facile fossil-free source for the production of hydrogen (H2). Electrochemical water splitting is considered a promising and potential approach for accomplishing hydrogen frugality. Although water-splitting reaction is the most versatile and green technique, it accounts for only 4% of the universal H2 production. The main hindrance in large-scale production is the sluggish kinetics of the reaction, which employs costlier and precious catalysts. In addition, the half-cell reactions for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting require two different types of precious catalysts, which not only increases the cost but also decreases the efficiency due to the enhanced complexity of the system. Hence, designing an efficient, robust, nonprecious, earth-abundant, and low-cost electrocatalyst capable of catalyzing both HER and OER during overall water splitting is an urgent requirement to meet the energy demand for sustainable growth. Here, a highly potential bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated using quinone-substituted cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (HQCoPc) with carbon nanoparticles (Ketjen black, KB). The organic hybrid of HQCoPc + KB modified on GCE and Ni foam showed remarkable electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER in acidic and basic conditions, respectively. The HQCoPc + KB composite affords a lower onset of 76 mV for HER and an overpotential of 234 and 360 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for HER and OER, respectively, with superior stability for more than 40,000 s. The designed HQCoPc + KB bifunctional electrocatalyst not only offers a better catalyst for addressing a water-splitting reaction but also provides cost-effectiveness and good chemical stability for sustainable energy technology.</description>

                Coated Titanium Anodes (CTAs) exhibit significant potential in addressing the high energy consumption challenge inherent in current manganese electrowinning processes. However, the electrodeposition of manganese dioxide (MnO2) at the anode limits the utilization of CTAs in conventional manganese electrolytic cells. Herein, a novel H+ exchange membrane (HEM) electrolytic cell was proposed and applied to manganese electrowinning employing Ti/IrO2 &#8722; RuO2 &#8722; SiO2 anode. The HEM electrolytic cell is a three-chamber electrolytic reactor consisting of cathode chamber, acidification chamber and anode chamber separated by woven terylene diaphragm and HEM. The results indicated that after 24 h of electrowinning, the cathodic current efficiency (CE) of 85.1 % was achieved, along with a specific energy consumption (EC) of 4189 kW&#183;h/t. Compared to conventional industrial electrowinning technology, this represents an increase in CE by more than 15 % and a reduction in EC by over 1400 kW&#183;h/t. The unique structure of the HEM electrolytic cell effectively prevents MnO2 deposition, ensuring the functionality of the CTAs and eliminating the generation of anode mud. Additionally, the H+ from the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is collected and concentrated in the acidification chamber. This resulted in a spent electrolyte with 15.2 g/L H2SO4, enabling its reuse in extracting manganese ores. Employing the HEM electrolytic cell with a Ti/IrO2 &#8722; RuO2 &#8722; SiO2 anode for manganese electrowinning is therefore considered an energy-efficient and clean approach. It is highly recommended for saving energy and reducing carbon emissions in industrial processes.</description>

                Developing stable and high-performance electrodes for effective removal of antibiotics from wastewater remains a significant challenge. Herein, a novel Ce-doped PbO2 electrode with Ti4O7-reduced graphene oxide as the middle layer (Ti/Ti4O7-rGO/Ce-PbO2) was fabricated through drop-coating and electrodeposition for the electrocatalytic degradation of ceftazidime (CAZ). The prepared Ti/Ti4O7-rGO/Ce-PbO2 electrode exhibited more active sites, higher oxygen evolution potential, and stronger ability for hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation. In the degradation experiments, approximately 100 % of CAZ (30 mg L&#8722;1) was degraded by the Ti/Ti4O7-rGO/Ce-PbO2 electrode at 40 mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution within 90 min. The quenching test and EPR analysis indicated that the &#8226;OH played a pivotal role in the degradation process. A possible degradation mechanism of CAZ, which involved bond breaking, decarboxylation, demethylation, oxidization, and ring-opening, was proposed. The Escherichia coli inhibition experiment showed that the toxicity of CAZ was substantially reduced after electrochemical oxidation. The Ti/Ti4O7-rGO/Ce-PbO2 electrode exhibited a constant degradation efficiency (&gt; 99 %) after 10 consecutive cycles, and its service life can reach 3000 min. Furthermore, CAZ maintained a high removal efficiency in swine wastewater. This study provides a new approach toward fabricating a Ce-PbO2 electrode with Ti4O7-rGO middle layer for the degradation of antibiotics in wastewater.</description>

                Developing an affordable and efficient electrocatalyst for bifunctional activity is crucial for the advancement of water electrolysis technology. Doping with foreign atoms in electrocatalysts can tune the electronic properties, which further improves the water-splitting process. Herein, we have developed Ce-doped Ni0.85Se as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. The hydrothermal method was used to develop a two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet of the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst. The as-developed pristine and doped electrocatalysts were characterized through various techniques. The optimized Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst represents &#8722;0.238 and 1.56 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode as an onset potential for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, to generate 20 and 50 mA/cm2 current density. The Ce0.1Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst works as a suitable cell in an alkaline medium with 1.73 V to generate 10 mA/cm2 and 24 h stability. The introduction of Ce doping plays a pivotal role in tuning the electronic environment and facilitating a synergistic effect, ultimately improving the overall efficiency. Moreover, the active sites for water splitting were generated by expansion and distortion in the Ni0.85Se lattice. The enhanced specific surface area and porous 2D nanosheets of the doped sample are beneficial for water splitting. The theoretical results also prove that after doping with Ce, the catalyst has zero band gap, optimum Gibbs hydrogen adsorption energy, and an electronic state are the reasons for improved electrocatalytic performance. The actual active sites in the Ce-doped Ni0.85Se electrocatalyst were determined with density functional theory calculations. Therefore, this idea can generate a route for developing a doped electrocatalyst with efficient and stable activity.</description>

                The reality of long-term rechargeable and high-performance zinc&#8211;air batteries relies majorly on cost-effective and eminent bifunctional electrocatalysts, which can perform both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we demonstrate a new approach for the synthesis of in-situ-grown layered double hydroxide of iron and cobalt over a cobalt nanoparticle-enriched nitrogen-doped carbon frame (CoL 2:1) by a simple coprecipitation reaction with facile scale-up and explore its electrocatalytic ORR and OER activity for an electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery. Consequently, the developed composite displays excellent ORR and OER activity with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.84 V, a limiting current density of 5.85 mA/cm2, and an OER overpotential of 320 mV with exceptional stability. The outstanding bifunctionality index of the catalyst (&#916;E = 0.72 V) inspired us to utilize it as a cathode catalyst in an in-house developed prototype zinc&#8211;air battery. The battery could easily supply a specific capacity of 804 mAh/g with a maximum peak power density of 161 mW/cm2. The battery exhibits an attractive charge&#8211;discharge profile with a lesser voltage gap of 0.76 V at 10 mA/cm2 with durability for a period of 200 h and a voltage efficiency of 97%, which surpassed the corresponding Pt/C + RuO2-based zinc&#8211;air battery. Further, a maximum load of 50 mA/cm2 could easily be sustained during cycling, revealing its outstanding stability. A series-connected two CoL 2:1-based zinc&#8211;air batteries effortlessly enlighten a pinwheel fan and LED panel simultaneously, revealing its practicality. The high electrical conductivity and greater specific surface area of Co/N&#8211;C and its robust attachment with Fe/Co LDH preserves both active sites, thereby resulting in exceptional performance. Our method is capable of being flexible enough to create various bifunctional Co/N&#8211;C-based composite electrodes, opening up a feasible pathway to rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries with maximum energy density.</description>

                Developing readily available and cost-effective electrocatalysts as an alternative to the noble metals is a critical issue for renewable hydrogen energy generation. Mesoporous high-entropy oxides (HEOs) are among the most noteworthy candidates in the kinetically challenged process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER); The current study notifies the successful fabrication, and characterization of a series of meso-structured HEOs (5 elements) and MEOs (4 elements) nanopowders with remarkable electrocatalytic performance. Obtained results reveal that the synthesized HEOs and MEOs nanocompounds are meso-structured (with pore size of &#8275;43-67 &#197;) with particle size of &#8275;20-30 nm. Combusted HEOs and MEOs powders have high crystallinity degree (derived from XRD analysis) and homogenous elemental distributions. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared HEOs and MEOs nanopowders were studied using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses. It was specified that HEO nanoparticles (HEO 0.95 sample) exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance compared to MEOs particles with respect to their overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA.cm-2 and Tafel slope of 53 mV.dec-1. The drop of the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and increase of the conductivity in HEO 0.95 sample contributes to the improved electrocatalytic OER activity of the HEOs nanopowders. Taking ECSA into account, the improved electrocatalytic activity of meso-structured HEO 0.95 sample relates to the large number of active sites in this sample. The XRD, TEM, and FE-SEM results of HEO 0.95 sample after OER analysis indicated no alteration in phase composition and morphology revealing the reusability of the synthesized nanoparticles. This study also provides an insight into the behavior of Co, Ni, Cu elements as typical electrocatalysts as well as Zn and Mg elements as obscure electrocatalysts for efficient OER electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the impact of adiabatic temperature, crystallinity degree and physicochemical features of meso-structured particles on electrocatalytic performance are explored.</description>

                ConspectusThe development of an advanced energy conversion system for water electrolysis with high efficiency and durability is of great significance for a hydrogen-powered society. This progress relies on the fabrication of electrocatalysts with superior electrochemical performance. Despite decades of advancements in exploring high-performance noble and non-noble metal electrocatalysts, several challenges persist at both the micro- and macrolevels in the field of water electrolysis.At the microlevel, which encompasses electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization, design strategies for high-performance electrocatalysts have primarily focused on interface chemical engineering. However, comprehensive understanding and investigation of interface chemical engineering across various length scales, from micrometers to atomic scales, are still lacking. This deficiency hampers the rational design of catalysts with optimal performance. Under harsh reaction conditions, such as high bias potential and highly acidic or alkaline media, the surface of catalyst materials is susceptible to undergoing "reconstruction", deviating from what is observed through ex situ characterization techniques postsynthesis. Conventional ex situ characterization methods do not provide an accurate depiction of the catalyst's structural evolution during the electrocatalytic reaction, hindering the exploration of the catalytic mechanism.At the macrolevel, pertaining to catalysis-performance evaluation systems and devices, traditional laboratory settings employ a conventional three-electrode or two-electrode system to assess the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. However, this approach does not accurately simulate hydrogen production under realistic industrial conditions, such as elevated temperatures (60-70 &#176;C), high current densities exceeding 0.5 A cm-2, and flowing electrolytes. To address this limitation, it is crucial to develop testing equipment and methodologies that replicate the actual industrial conditions.In this Account, we propose a multiscale research framework for water electrolysis, spanning from microscale synthesis to macroscale scaled reactor design. Our approach focuses on the design and evaluation of high-performance HER/OER (hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction) electrocatalysts, incorporating the following strategies: Leveraging principles of interface chemical engineering across various length scales (micrometers, nanometers, and atoms) enables the design of catalyst materials that enhance both activity and durability. This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between the catalyst structure and activity, implementing in situ/operando characterization techniques to monitor dynamic interfacial reactions and surface reconstruction processes. This facilitates a profound exploration of catalytic reaction mechanisms, offering insights into the catalyst's structural evolution during the electrocatalytic reaction. We construct a laboratory-scale membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrochemical reactor capable of operating at high current densities (&gt;1 A cm-2) to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance under simulated industrial conditions. This ensures objective and authentic assessments of the catalyst application potential. Throughout the following sections, we illustrate the application of interface chemical engineering on different length scales in designing diverse electrocatalyst materials. We rely on in situ characterization techniques to gain a profound understanding of the mechanisms behind the HER and OER. Additionally, we describe the development of both acidic and alkaline MEA electrochemical reactors to enhance the precision of electrocatalytic performance evaluation. Finally, we provide a concise overview of the challenges and opportunities in this field.</description>

                We carefully analyze how the abundance of Nitrogen over Oxygen evolves when dependent on metallicity stellar yields with a primary component of N proceeding from AGBs stars are used. We show the results obtained with a chemical evolution models grid, calculated with variable star formation efficiencies, which produce different star formation histories. Finally we see how the N/O abundance is related on the evolutionary history.</description>

                We study the properties of double white dwarf (DWD) mergers by performing hydrodynamic simulations using the new and improved adaptive mesh refinement code Octo-Tiger. We follow the orbital evolution of DWD systems of mass ratio q=0.7 for tens of orbits until and after the merger to investigate them as a possible origin for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) type stars. We reproduce previous results, finding that during the merger, the Helium WD donor star is tidally disrupted within 20-80 minutes since the beginning of the simulation onto the accretor Carbon-Oxygen WD, creating a high temperature shell around the accretor. We investigate the possible Helium burning in this shell and the merged object's general structure. Specifically, we are interested in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredged-up to the hot shell and the amount of Oxygen-18 produced. This is critical as the discovery of very low Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios in RCB stars pointed out the merger scenario as a favorable explanation for their origin. A small amount of hydrogen in the donor may help keep the Oxygen-16 to Oxygen-18 ratios within observational bounds, even if moderate dredge-up from the accretor occurs. In addition, we perform a resolution study to reconcile the difference found in the amount of Oxygen-16 dredge-up between smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and grid-based simulations.</description>

                Intermediate mass stars (1-8 solar masses) evolve along the Asymptotic Giant Branch after completion of hydrogen and helium core burning. At the tip they lose for several ten to hundred thousand years copious amounts of mass and exhibit various forms of variability, as for example large-amplitude variations with periods of one to five years. In the oxygen-rich circumstellar envelopes powerful OH, H2O and SiO masers may operate. Part of the AGB population is converted to carbon stars. During the latest phases of AGB evolution the mass loss rates approach several 10e-5 solar masses/year, so that the stars become invisible in the optical and in part in the near infrared. On departure from the AGB a fundamental transition in the mass loss process is taking place changing from a spherically symmetric outflow on the AGB to axi-symmetric or point-symmetric geometries. While the mass loss rates decrease to ~10e-8 solar masses/year, the velocities are strongly increasing. Stars are now in their "post-AGB" phase. Mounting evidence is gathered that during the very latest phase of AGB evolution and during the post-AGB phase, evolution proceeds on very short timescales, which in extreme cases is comparable to the working life of an astronomer.</description>

                While extensive research has been conducted on the evolution of coal's molecular structure during coalification, the heterogeneity and complexity of coal continue to impede the accurate and precise quantitative characterization of its structural evolution mechanism. In this study, the organic matter source, coal quality, carbon skeleton structure, and functional group occurrence of coal at different coalification stages have been determined using maceral identification, vitrinite reflectance, industrial quality, elemental analysis, and spectral analysis. Four molecular models have been created through computer-aided molecular design. The results indicate that the hydrogen atoms in the benzene ring structure reduce as coalification increases. The content of aliphatic compounds gradually decreases, while the length of aliphatic side chains first decreases (Ro,max&lt;1.81%) and then increases (Ro,max&gt;1.81%). Moreover, the chemical structure of coal tends to mature and stabilize, as the degree of coal crystallization increases, and the oxygen-containing groups gradually decrease. Therefore, aromatization increases with the condensation reaction dominating in the late stage of coalification. After intensive attempts to determine the chemical bond mode between aromatic carbon, aliphatic side chain, and oxygen functional group, the final molecular structure models are presented as C188H165O13N3 (F-1), C182H161O9N5 (J-1), C195H153O10N3 (T-1), and C193H129O7N3 (W-1). Furthermore, the mechanism of coalification is discussed based on the variation of the side chains and chemical bonds. According to the adsorption heat of functional groups, the methane adsorption capacity increases as the degree of coalification increases. The inflection point of methane adsorption capacity is at Ro,max&gt;1.80%. This study provides a theoretical framework to understand the molecular structure evolution of coals at varying degrees of metamorphism. Additionally, it proposes a reliable method for characterizing coal molecular structures with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Synergistic Effects of Temperature Rise Inhibitor at the Water Tricalcium Silicate Interface</title>

                Organic&#8211;inorganic composites play a crucial role in modulating concrete properties, encompassing interfacial interactions and their synergistic mechanisms. Unraveling these interactions presents a formidable challenge. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were employed to probe the intricate structure, competition, and equilibrium state of interfacial connections involving a temperature rise inhibitor (TRI), C3S, and water. Computational results reveal that the interplay of different bonding networks significantly influences the equilibrium state of the C3S&#8211;TRI interfacial interactions, marked by dynamic adsorption&#8211;desorption equilibria. The interaction between C3S and TRI manifests in intricate calcium&#8211;oxygen and hydrogen bonding networks, which are both easily disturbed by water molecules. Oxygen sites in water serve as binding sites for calcium atoms in C3S and hydrogen atoms in TRI, thereby attenuating the C3S&#8211;TRI bonding. Simultaneously, hydrogen sites in water engage with oxygen sites in the TRI, diminishing calcium&#8211;oxygen bonding and prompting the detachment of TRI from the C3S surface. Moreover, these hydrogen sites interact with the oxygen sites on the C3S surface, inducing lattice structure alterations and removal of calcium atoms from C3S. As TRI detaches into the liquid phase, it forms complexes with calcium ions, reducing the migration rate of calcium ions within the liquid phase. This study represents the inaugural comprehensive evaluation of the interfacial interaction mechanism between TRI, C3S, and water, offering fundamental insights into the impact of TRI on the evolution of the C3S phase. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay governing concrete properties, paving the way for enhanced control and optimization in concrete technology.</description>

      <title>Importance of the &lt;scp&gt;ECM&lt;/scp&gt;&#8211;receptor interaction for adaptive response to hypoxia based on integrated transcription and translation analysis</title>

                Abstract Low dissolved oxygen (LO) conditions represent a major environmental challenge to marine life, especially benthic animals. For these organisms, drastic declines in oxygen availability (hypoxic events) can trigger mass mortality events and thus, act as agents of selection influencing the evolution of adaptations. In sea cucumbers, one of the most successful groups of benthic invertebrates, the exposure to hypoxic conditions triggers adaptive adjustments in metabolic rates and behaviour. It is unclear, however, how these adaptive responses are regulated and the genetic mechanisms underpinning them. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by assessing the genetic regulation (transcription and translation) of hypoxia exposure in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus . Transcriptional and translational gene expression profiles under short&#8208; and long&#8208;term exposure to low oxygen conditions are tightly associated with extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8211;receptor interaction in which laminin and collagen likely have important functions. Finding revealed that genes with a high translational efficiency (TE) had a relatively short upstream open reading frame (uORF) and a high uORF normalized minimal free energy, suggesting that sea cucumbers may respond to hypoxic stress via altered TE. These results provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms that confer adaptive capacity to holothurians to survive oxygen deficiency conditions and may also be used to inform the development of strategies for mitigating the harmful effects of hypoxia on other marine invertebrates facing similar challenges.</description>

                The effects of some oxide intermediate layers on the electrochemical behavior and characteristics of oxide-coated titanium electrodes Ti/PbO2, Ti/Co3O4 and Ti/CuCO2O4 have been investigated.The results showed that the intermediate layers of Co3O4, PdOx, SnO2 and Sb2O3 could markedly decrease the interface resistance of the electrodes. The electrode Ti/PbO2 with intermediate layer of (Sb2O3+PdOx) and the electrode Ti/Co3O4 with intermediate layer of (SnO2+PdOx) showed nearly the same reaction activity for anodic evolution of Cl2 as the industrial electrode consisting of Ti/RuO2+TiO2, but higher oxygen overpotentials than the latter.</description>

      <title>Diagenetic Genesis and Evolution of Coal-Bearing Tight Sandstone Reservoir in the Yangxia Formation, Northern Kuqa Depression, Tarim Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c10100</link>

                Coal seams of the Yangxia Formation are widespread in the northern part of the Kuqa Depression in the Tarim Basin. During the thermal evolution of the coal seams, the generated fluids of different periods and natures have a significant impact on tight sandstone reservoirs. To further investigate the diagenetic characteristics and reservoir genesis of the tight sandstones due to the influence of coal seams, an in-depth exploration of the causes of dissolution and cementation in the reservoirs was conducted through thin-section casting, cathode luminescence, scanning electron microscopy, carbon&#8211;oxygen isotopic analyses, and X-ray diffraction of whole rock and authigenic clay minerals, along with burial evolution history and fluid evolution history. It is suggested that two phases of acidic fluids are mainly produced during the thermal evolution process of coal seams, including an early humic acid and a late organic carboxylic acid. The early phase humic acid plays a purifying role in reservoirs with coarse particles, rigidity-rich particles, and good permeability conditions. It selectively dissolves sedimentary calcareous mud and calcite, and the dissolution products are completely migrated. At the same time, it inhibits early carbonate cementation. The late organic carboxylic acid will dissolve potassium feldspar and some volcanic rock debris, and the dissolution products are difficult to migrate under the sealing conditions caused by lithological differences, which often take the cementation form of siliceous overgrowth and kaolinite or illite. In addition to the cementation resulting from the dissolution products of acidic fluids produced by the coal seams, the CO2-rich fluids generated by the coal seam thermal evolution will combine with ions such as Ca2+ from different sources, resulting in two phases of carbonate cementation. Based on the above research, this study summarizes a set of diagenetic evolution models for coal-bearing reservoirs.</description>

                The review analyzes the data available in the literature on the rates, characteristics and mechanisms of oxygen reduction to a superoxide anion radical at the sites of the photosynthetic electron transport chain where this reduction can occur. The existing assumptions about the role of the components of these sites in this process are critically examined, with use of thermodynamic approaches and the results of recent studies. The process of O2 reduction at the acceptor side of PSI, which is considered the main place of this process in the photosynthetic chain, is described in detail. The evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus in the context of controlling the leakage of electrons to O2 is considered. The reasons limiting the application of the results obtained with isolated segments of the photosynthetic chain to estimate the rates of O2 reduction at the corresponding sites in the intact thylakoid membrane are discussed.</description>

                Abstract How chronic mutational processes and punctuated bursts of DNA damage drive evolution of the cancer genome is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to disentangle and quantify distinct mechanisms underlying genome evolution in single cells, during single mitoses and at single-strand resolution. To distinguish between chronic (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and acute (ultraviolet light (UV)) mutagenesis, we microfluidically separate pairs of sister cells from the first mitosis following burst UV damage. Strikingly, UV mutations manifest as sister-specific events, revealing mirror-image mutation phasing genome-wide. In contrast, ROS mutagenesis in transcribed regions is reduced strand agnostically. Successive rounds of genome replication over persisting UV damage drives multiallelic variation at CC dinucleotides. Finally, we show that mutation phasing can be resolved to single strands across the entire genome of liver tumors from F1 mice. This strategy can be broadly used to distinguish the contributions of overlapping cancer relevant mutational processes.</description>

                The evolution of charge carriers in photoexcited room temperature ZnO nanoparticles in solution is investigated using ultrafast ultraviolet photoluminescence spectroscopy, ultrafast Zn K-edge absorption spectroscopy and ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The photoluminescence is excited at 4.66 eV, well above the band edge, and shows that electron cooling in the conduction band and exciton formation occur in &lt;500 fs, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. The X-ray absorption measurements, obtained upon excitation close to the band edge at 3.49 eV, are sensitive to the migration and trapping of holes. They reveal that the 2 ps transient largely reproduces the previously reported transient obtained at 100 ps time delay in synchrotron studies. In addition, the X-ray absorption signal is found to rise in ~1.4 ps, which we attribute to the diffusion of holes through the lattice prior to their trapping at singly-charged oxygen vacancies. Indeed, the MD simulations show that impulsive trapping of holes induces an ultrafast expansion of the cage of Zn atoms in &lt;200 fs, followed by an oscillatory response at a frequency of ~100 cm-1, which corresponds to a phonon mode of the system involving the Zn sub-lattice.</description>

                Water splitting provides clean hydrogen via different technologies such as alkaline water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, solid oxide electrolysis cells, and photoelectrolysis, each with advantages and challenges. The focus on alkaline water electrolysis highlights its maturity compared to emerging methods. Non-noble metal catalysts offer increased stability, low cost and operational lifespan. Challenges such as low current density, gas crossover, corrosive electrolytes, and limited efficiency are still to be addressed. These advanced electrocatalysts are summarized for alkaline oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Meanwhile, different factors including product gas bubble management, operation conditions, separator and electrolyte affecting the performance were concluded and discussed. For the promising approach, seawater splitting is still far from large-scale application. Salinity, pH fluctuations, and complex composition are significant obstacles. The review underscores the need for improvements in electrocatalysts to enhance the efficiency, stability, and practicality of water splitting for hydrogen production, ultimately contributing to the growth of the clean hydrogen market and supporting the transition to sustainable energy systems.</description>

                Abstract Developing Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Mo&#8208;based heterogeneous nanomaterials is of great significance for energy conversion, especially in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however, it remains a challenge to identify the active sites at the interface due to the structure complexity. Herein, the real active sites are systematically explored during the HER process in varied Mo&#8208;based 2D materials by theoretical computational and magnetron sputtering approaches first to filtrate the candidates, then successfully combined the MoSi 2 and MoO 3 together through Oxygen doping to construct heterojunctions. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between the MoSi 2 and MoO 3 , the obtained MoSi 2 @MoO 3 exhibits an unprecedented overpotential of 72 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Density functional theory calculations uncover the different Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916; G H* ) values achieved at the interfaces with different sites as adsorption sites. The results can facilitate the optimization of heterojunction electrocatalyst design principles for the Mo&#8208;based 2D materials.</description>

                Electroless copper-plated multiwalled carbon nanotube-reinforced titanium matrix (MWCNT-Cu/Ti) composites were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The microstructure evolution, interface characteristics and properties of the composites, including strength and corrosion resistance, were investigated. The results showed that the surface impurities and structural defects of the MWCNTs were successfully removed, and the oxygen-containing functional groups such as-OH, and -COOH were introduced by acid functionalization. The structure of the electroless-plated Cu layer is that of crystalline Cu. The precipitation of TiC phases by the interface reaction of the MWCNT-Cu/Ti composites is prevented. The compressive strength of the MWCNT-Cu/Ti composites was 2303 MPa, which is approximately 2 times greater than that of pure Ti. The corrosion resistance decreased in the order MWCNT-Cu/Ti &gt; MWCNTs/Ti &gt; pure Ti. The orientations of [112&#773;0]&#945;-Ti//[11&#773;0]TiC, (1&#773;100)&#945;-Ti//(11&#773;1)TiC in the MWCNTs/Ti composites and Ti2Cu(2&#773;00)//Ti(1&#773;100), Ti2Cu (211) //Ti(1&#773;010) in the MWCNT-Cu/Ti composites are related.</description>

                Abstract In the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, revealing the dynamic evolution of the active sites is crucial to achieve the activity improvement and stability of the catalyst. This study reports a perovskite oxide in which atomic (Co 0 ) in&#8208;situ embedded exsolution occurs during the high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This unique anchoring strategy significantly improves the Co 3+ /Co 2+ cycling efficiency at the interface and inhibits metal leaching during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The Co@L&#8208;PBMC catalyst exhibited superior PMS activation ability and could achieve 99% degradation of tetracycline within 5 min. The combination of experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidates that the electron&#8208;deficient oxygen vacancy accepts an electron from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in a significant electron delocalization of the Co site, thereby facilitating the adsorption of the *HSO 5 /*OH intermediate onto the &#8220;metal&#8208;V O bridge&#8221; structure. This work provides insights into the PMS activation mechanism at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for environmental remediation.

                Abstract A key approach towards better realization of intermittent renewable energy resources, namely, solar and wind, is green electrochemical hydrogen production from water electrolysis. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts aimed at developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts that are earth-abundant and electroactive towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes, wherein an initial water dissociation step is followed by a two-electron transfer cathodic reaction. Although relatively earth-abundant, vanadium-based electrocatalysts have been sparsely reported due to subpar electroactivity and kinetics towards water electrolysis in general and alkaline electrolysis in specific. Herein, we investigate the fine-tuning of orthorhombic V 2 O 5 -based electrocatalysts as candidates for HER through a scalable two-step sol&#8211;gel calcination procedure. Briefly, surface-induced anionic oxygen deficiencies and cationic dopants are synergistically studied experimentally and theoretically. To that end, first-principle facet-dependent density function theory (DFT) calculations were conducted and revealed that the coupling of certain dopants on V 2 O 5 and co-induction of oxygen vacancies can enhance the catalytic HER performance by the creation of new electronic states near the Fermi level ( E F ), enhancing conductivity, and modulating surface binding of adsorbed protons, respectively. This was reflected experimentally through kinetically non-ideal alkaline electrochemical HER using Zn 0.4 V 1.6 O 5 whereby &#8722; 194 mV of overpotential was required to attain &#8722; 10 mA/cm 2 of current density, as opposed to pristine V 2 O 5 which required 32% higher overpotential requirement at the same conditions. The disclosed work can be extended to other intrinsically sluggish transition metal (TM)&#8211;based oxides via the presented systematic tuning of surface and bulk microenvironment modulation.

      <title>Petrogenesis of the Newly Discovered Neoproterozoic Adakitic Rock in Bure Area, Western Ethiopia Shield: Implication for the Pan-African Tectonic Evolution</title>

                The Neoproterozoic Bure adakitic rock in the western Ethiopia shield is a newly discovered magmatic rock type. However, the physicochemical conditions during its formation, and its source characteristics are still not clear, restricting a full understanding of its petrogenesis and geodynamic evolution. In this study, in order to shed light on the physicochemical conditions during rock formation and provide further constraints on the petrogenesis of the Bure adakitic rock, we conduct electron microprobe analysis on K-feldspar, plagioclase, and biotite. Additionally, we investigate the trace elements and Hf isotopes of zircon, and the Sr-Nd isotopes of the whole rock. The results show that the K-feldspar is orthoclase (Or = 89.08~96.37), the plagioclase is oligoclase (Ab = 74.63~85.99), and the biotite is magnesio-biotite. Based on the biotite analysis results, we calculate that the pressure during rock formation was 1.75~2.81 kbar (average value of 2.09 kbar), representing a depth of approximately 6.39~10.2 km (average value of 7.60 km). The zircon thermometer yields a crystallization temperature of 659~814 &#176;C. Most of the (Ce/Ce*)D values in the zircons plotted above the Ni-NiO oxygen buffer pair, and the calculated magmatic oxygen fugacity (logfO2) values vary from &#8722;18.5 to &#8722;4.9, revealing a relatively high magma oxygen fugacity. The uniform contents of FeO, MgO, and K2O in the biotite suggest a crustal magma source for the Bure adakitic rock. The relatively low (87Sr/86Sr)i values of 0.70088 to 0.70275, positive &#949;Nd(t) values of 3.26 to 7.28, together with the positive &#949;Hf(t) values of 7.64~12.99, suggest that the magma was sourced from a Neoproterozoic juvenile crust, with no discernable involvement of a pre-Neoproterozoic continental crust, which is coeval with early magmatic stages in the Arabian Nubian Shield elsewhere. Additionally, the mean Nd model ages demonstrate an increasing trend from the northern parts (Egypt, Sudan, Afif terrane of Arabia, and Eritrea and northern Ethiopia; 0.87 Ga) to the central parts (Western Ethiopia shield; 1.03 Ga) and southern parts (Southern Ethiopia Shield, 1.13 Ga; Kenya, 1.2 Ga) of the East African Orogen, which indicate an increasing contribution of pre-Pan-African crust towards the southern part of the East African Orogen. Based on the negative correlation between MgO and Al2O3 in the biotite, together with the Lu/Hf-Y and Yb-Y results of the zircon, we infer that the Bure adakitic rock was formed in an arc&#8211;arc collision orogenic environment. Combining this inference with the whole rock geochemistry and U-Pb age of the Bure adakitic rock, we further propose that the rock is the product of thickened juvenile crust melting triggered by the Neoproterozoic Pan-African Orogeny.</description>

      <title>Co and Co3O4 in the Hydrolysis of Boron-Containing Hydrides: H2O Activation on the Metal and Oxide Active Centers</title>

      <description>Vladislav R. Butenko, O.V. Komova, &#1042;.&#1048;. &#1057;&#1080;&#1084;&#1072;&#1075;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;, Inna L. Lipatnikova, Anna M. Ozerova, N. A. Danilova, Vladimir A. Rogov, &#1043;. &#1042;. &#1054;&#1076;&#1077;&#1075;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, &#1054;. &#1040;. &#1041;&#1091;&#1083;&#1072;&#1074;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1082;&#1086;, Yu. A. Chesalov, O.V. Netskina, Materials. 17(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394817931

                This work focuses on the comparison of H2 evolution in the hydrolysis of boron-containing hydrides (NaBH4, NH3BH3, and (CH2NH2BH3)2) over the Co metal catalyst and the Co3O4-based catalysts. The Co3O4 catalysts were activated in the reaction medium, and a small amount of CuO was added to activate Co3O4 under the action of weaker reducers (NH3BH3, (CH2NH2BH3)2). The high activity of Co3O4 has been previously associated with its reduced states (nanosized CoBn). The performed DFT modeling shows that activating water on the metal-like surface requires overcoming a higher energy barrier compared to hydride activation. The novelty of this study lies in its focus on understanding the impact of the remaining cobalt oxide phase. The XRD, TPR H2, TEM, Raman, and ATR FTIR confirm the formation of oxygen vacancies in the Co3O4 structure in the reaction medium, which increases the amount of adsorbed water. The kinetic isotopic effect measurements in D2O, as well as DFT modeling, reveal differences in water activation between Co and Co3O4-based catalysts. It can be assumed that the oxide phase serves not only as a precursor and support for the reduced nanosized cobalt active component but also as a key catalyst component that improves water activation.</description>

      <title>The causal arrows - from genotype, environment and management to plant phenotype - are double headed</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.08.588646</link>

                Unidirectional, cause-and-effect arrows are drawn from genotype (G), environment (E), and agronomic management (M) to the plant phenotype in crop stands. Here we focus on the overlooked bi-directionality of these arrows. The phenotype-to-genotype arrow includes increased mutation rates in stressed phenotypes, relative to basal rates. From a developmental viewpoint, the phenotype modulates gene expression returning multiple cellular phenotypes with a common genome. From a computational viewpoint, the phenotype influences gene expression in a process of downward causation. The phenotype-to-environment arrow is captured in the process of niche construction, which spans from persistent and global (e.g., photosynthetic archaea and cyanobacteria that emerged ~3.4 billion years ago created the oxygen-rich atmosphere that enabled the evolution of aerobic organisms and eukaryotes) to transient and local (e.g., lucerne tap root constructs soil biopores that influence the root phenotype of the following wheat crop). Research on crop rotations illustrates but is divorced of niche construction theory. The phenotype-to-management arrow involves, for example, a diseased crop that triggers fungicide treatments. Making explicit the bi-directionality of the arrows in the G X E X M model allows to connect crop improvement and agronomy with other, theoretically rich scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Roles of hygrothermal aging temperature and time in degradation of the fracture toughness of highly cross&#8208;linked epoxy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/app.55541</link>
      <description>Kushal Mishra, Aparna Singh, Journal of applied polymer science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394765039

                Abstract The evolution of plane&#8208;strain fracture toughness in highly cross&#8208;linked epoxies was assessed for different hygrothermal aging temperatures (25, 50, and 75&#176;C) and durations (0&#8211;75 days). The absorption of water increased with hygrothermal aging, but at a diminishing rate and without saturating. A fraction of the absorbed water persisted despite prolonged drying. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the epoxy&#8208;decomposition temperature decreased with hygrothermal aging. 13 C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated an increase in the de&#8208;shielding of carbon atoms in the vicinity of electronegative elements like oxygen with hygrothermal aging severity, indicating the development of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tracked the chemical bonding state of carbon by using a narrow scan on the C1s binding energy region. Upon hygrothermal aging, there was a decrease in C&#63743;C/C&#63742;C groups, indicating main chain scission through hydrolysis. A simultaneous increase in the C&#63743;O species indicates the formation of alcohols as hydrolysis reaction products. In this manner, retained water was involved in hydrogen bonding and chemical reactions with the epoxy. With increasing severity of hygrothermal aging, the fracture toughness decreased. This was consistent with fracture surface micrographs that showed a greater distance amongst crack stretch marks in specimens with less toughness.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis on the biomass syngas fueled chemical looping hydrogen generation process in fixed bed reactor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131308</link>
      <description>Zixiang Gao, Di Wu, Fan Yin, Libin Sun, Dewang Zeng, Rui Xiao, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394787383

                Because of its simple structure and easy operation, the fixed bed reactor is widely used in the chemical looping process to assess the performance of oxygen carriers (OC) or to evaluate new chemical looping technologies. However, the systematic investigation of the redox behavior and temperature evolution during the chemical looping hydrogen generation (CLHG) process in the fixed bed reactor under different conditions, which is crucial for process optimization and reactor design, has received less attention. In the present work, the redox characteristics of the CLHG process with biomass syngas as the fuel in a fixed bed reactor were investigated and analyzed from a perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics. Results showed that high redox temperature (&gt;800 &#176;C) favors the fuel conversion due to the improved reaction kinetics and favorable thermodynamics. A space velocity in the range of 0.12-0.5 s-1 and superficial velocity of 0.008-0.075 m/s can provide enough reaction time meanwhile enhance the external diffusion of fuel gas, achieving high reduction degree of OC and further high H2 yield (3.4 mmol/g Fe2O3) and high H2 energy efficiency (45%). Moreover, a violent OC bed temperature rise (100 &#176;C) was observed in the air oxidization stage, which can be mitigated by diluting the Fe2O3 content and decreasing the air flow rate. Finally, the reaction front and flow front moving behavior were discussed in detail for a better understanding of the CLHG process.</description>

      <title>Swift heavy ion irradiation-driven energy band engineering and its profound influence on the photoresponse of &lt;b&gt;&#946;&lt;/b&gt;-Ga2O3 ultraviolet photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0203552</link>
      <description>Huiping Zhu, Yuanjun Tang, Aoxue Zhong, Lei Wang, Fanyu Liu, Peixiong Zhao, Jie Liu, Lei Shu, Zhenping Wu, Bo Li, Applied physics letters. 124(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394764485

                Swift heavy Ta ions with an ultra-high energy of 2896 MeV are utilized for irradiation of &#946;-Ga2O3 photodetectors. Noteworthy variations in device performance under different wavelengths are observed. Under 254 nm light illumination, the photocurrent of the devices exhibit degradation at low ion fluences but gradually recover and even surpass the performance of non-irradiated devices at the irradiation fluence of 1 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2. Conversely, under 365 nm light illumination, photocurrent increases at low fluence but slightly decreases at the same high fluence of 1 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2. Cathodoluminescence spectra and first-principles calculations elucidate the mechanism underlying the evolution of device performance with irradiation fluence. At low irradiation fluence, the introduction of point defects such as oxygen vacancies and gallium vacancies leads to an expansion of the bandgap, resulting in a decline in photocurrent under 254 nm light illumination. Additionally, deep defect levels are generated by these point defects, promoting an enhancement of photocurrent under 365 nm light illumination. Higher fluences transform these point defects into complex defects such as Ga&#8211;O pair vacancies, resulting in a reduction in the bandgap. Consequently, an increase in photocurrent is observed for devices illuminated with 254 nm light. However, at high irradiation fluences, charge recombination induced by the presence of deep defect levels becomes more significant, leading to a decrease in photocurrent when exposed to 365 nm light. No matter what, at 1 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2 fluence, &#946;-Ga2O3 photodetectors still maintain excellent performance, implying their strong radiation resistance and immense potential for application in space environments.</description>

      <title>Insight into the Pyrolysis and Gas Generation Behavior of Silicomanganese Slag and Assessing its Foaming Abilities in Foam Glass Ceramic</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142250</link>
      <description>Shichan Deng, Changrong Li, Xiaofeng Huang, Hongwei Guo, Wei Zhao, Bingji Yan, Peng Li, Journal of cleaner production. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394824603

                This paper proposes a novel route for the utilization of silicomanganese slag in the preparation of high-temperature foam ceramic materials, grounded in the unique characteristics of the slag. The phase evolution and gas generation mechanisms of silicomanganese slag was systematically investigated using thermogravimetric mass spectrometry (TG-MS), thermodynamic simulation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Foam glass ceramic with a density of 291&#177;8 kg/m3 and a compressive strength of 2.83&#177;0.07 MPa was prepared using silicomanganese slag as a foaming agent. This research indicated that manganese and sulfur in the silicomanganese slag are critical contributors to gas generation. Manganese in the slag oxidizes to dimanganese trioxide (Mn2O3) before reaching 1000&#176;C, and at temperatures between 1000-1200&#176;C, trivalent manganese (Mn3+) converts to divalent manganese (Mn2+) and enters the pyroxene crystal, releasing oxygen (O2). Sulfur in the slag, captured by divalent calcium (Ca2+), forms a more stable calcium sulfate (CaSO4) during heating and enriches the slag particle surface. As the temperature exceeds 1000&#176;C, Ca2+ gradually integrates into the pyroxene, prompting the release of sulfate decomposition products, forming sulfur dioxide (SO2) and O2. A small fraction of unreacted CaSO4 enters the glass phase, forming fibrous crystals that enhance the compressive strength of the foam glass-ceramic through fiber reinforcement. The outcomes of this work offer new insights into the high-value utilization of silicomanganese slag and enrich the understanding of gas generation mechanisms in Mn-based and S-based foaming agents.</description>

      <title>Constructing Bipolar Dual&#8208;Active Sites through High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Induced Electric Dipole Transition for Decoupling Oxygen Redox</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202401018</link>
      <description>Q. Zhang, Zhiyang Zheng, Runhua Gao, Xiao Xiao, Menggai Jiao, Boran Wang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, Advanced materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394720272

                Abstract It remains a significant challenge to construct active sites to break the trade&#8208;off between oxidation and reduction processes occurring in battery cathodes with conversion mechanism, especially for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) involved in the Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Here, we propose using a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;driven electric dipole transition strategy to activate and stabilize the tetrahedral sites, while enhancing the activity of octahedral sites through orbital hybridization in a FeCoNiMnCrO spinel oxide, thus constructing bipolar dual&#8208;active sites with high&#8208;low valence states, which can effectively decouple ORR/OER. The FeCoNiMnCrO high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide (HESO) with severe lattice distortion, exhibits a strong 1s&#8594;4s electric dipole transition and intense t 2g (Co)/e g (Ni)&#8208;2p(O L ) orbital hybridization that regulates the electronic descriptors, e g and t 2g , which leads to the formation of low&#8208;valence Co tetrahedral sites (Co th ) and high&#8208;valence Ni octahedral sites (Ni oh ), resulting in a higher half&#8208;wave potential of 0.87 V on Co th sites and a lower overpotential of 0.26 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 on Ni oh sites as well as a superior performance of ZABs compared to low/mild entropy spinel oxides (L/MESO). Therefore, entropy engineering presents a distinctive approach for designing catalytic sites by inducing novel electromagnetic properties in materials across various electrocatalytic reactions, particularly for decoupling systems.

      <title>Do Causes Influence Functional Aspects and Quality of Life in Patients with Nonfibrocystic Bronchiectasis?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/3446536</link>

                Background. The denomination of noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) includes several causes, and differences may be expected between the patient subgroups regarding age, comorbidities, and clinical and functional evolution. This study sought to identify the main causes of NCFB in a cohort of stable adult patients and to investigate whether such conditions would be different in their clinical, functional, and quality of life aspects. Methods. Between 2017 and 2019, all active patients with NCFB were prospectively evaluated searching for clinical data, past medical history, dyspnea severity grading, quality of life data, microbiological profile, and lung function (spirometry and six-minute walk test). Results. There was a female predominance; mean age was 54.7 years. Causes were identified in 82% of the patients, the most frequent being postinfections ( n=39 ), ciliary dyskinesia (CD) ( n=32 ), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( n=29 ). COPD patients were older, more often smokers (or former smokers) and with more comorbidities; they also had worse lung function (spirometry and oxygenation) and showed worse performance in the six-minute walk test (6MWT) (walked distance and exercise-induced hypoxemia). Considering the degree of dyspnea, in the more symptomatic group, patients had higher scores in the three domains and total score in SGRQ, besides having more exacerbations and more patients in home oxygen therapy. Conclusions. Causes most identified were postinfections, CD, and COPD. Patients with COPD are older and have worse pulmonary function and more comorbidities. The most symptomatic patients are clinically and functionally more severe, besides having worse quality of life.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Cellular Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species from Secondary Organic Aerosols in Epithelial Lining Fluid.</title>
      <link>https://openalex.org/W4394766603</link>
      <description>Manabu Shiraiwa, Ting Fang, Jia Wang, Pascale S. J. Lakey, Bing&#8208;Joe Hwang, K C Edwards, Shitij Kapur, Javier Mena, Yicheng Huang, Michelle A. Digman, Scott Weichenthal, Sergey A. Nizkorodov, Michael T. Kleinman, PubMed. None(215)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394766603

                Oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a key process for adverse aerosol health effects. Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) account for a major fraction of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &#8804;2.5 &#181;m (PM2.5). PM2.5 inhalation and deposition into the respiratory tract causes the formation of ROS by chemical reactions and phagocytosis of macrophages in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF), but their relative contributions are not well quantified and their link to oxidative stress remains uncertain. The specific aims of this project were (1) elucidating the chemical mechanism and quantifying the formation kinetics of ROS in the ELF by SOA; (2) quantifying the relative importance of ROS formation by chemical reactions and macrophages in the ELF.SOA particles were generated using reaction chambers from oxidation of various precursors including isoprene, terpenes, and aromatic compounds with or without nitrogen oxides (NOx). We collected size-segregated PM at two highway sites in Anaheim, CA, and Long Beach, CA, and at an urban site in Irvine, CA, during two wildfire events. The collected particles were extracted into water or surrogate ELF that contained lung antioxidants. ROS generation was quantified using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy with a spin-trapping technique. PM oxidative potential (OP) was also quantified using the dithiothreitol assay. In addition, kinetic modeling was applied for analysis and interpretation of experimental data. Finally, we quantified cellular superoxide release by RAW264.7 macrophage cells upon exposure to quinones and isoprene SOA using a chemiluminescence assay as calibrated with an EPR spin-probing technique. We also applied cellular imaging techniques to study the cellular mechanism of superoxide release and oxidative damage on cell membranes.Superoxide radicals (&#183;O2-) were formed from aqueous reactions of biogenic SOA generated by hydroxy radical (&#183;OH) photooxidation of isoprene, &#946;-pinene, &#945;-terpineol, and d-limonene. The temporal evolution of &#183;OH and &#183;O2- formation was elucidated by kinetic modeling with a cascade of aqueous reactions, including the decomposition of organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), &#183;OH oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols, and unimolecular decomposition of &#945;-hydroxyperoxyl radicals. Relative yields of various types of ROS reflected the relative abundance of ROOH and alcohols contained in SOA, which generated under high NOx conditions, exhibited lower ROS yields. ROS formation by SOA was also affected by pH. Isoprene SOA had higher &#183;OH and organic radical yields at neutral than at acidic pH. At low pH &#183;O2- was the dominant species generated by all types of SOA. At neutral pH, &#945;-terpineol SOA exhibited a substantial yield of carbon-centered organic radicals (R&#183;), while no radical formation was observed by aromatic SOA.Organic radicals in the ELF were formed by mixtures of Fe2+ and SOA generated from photooxidation of isoprene, &#945;-terpineol, and toluene. The molar yields of organic radicals by SOA were 5-10 times higher in ELF than in water. Fe2+ enhanced organic radical yields by a factor of 20-80. Ascorbate mediated redox cycling of iron ions and sustained organic peroxide decomposition, as supported by kinetic modeling reproducing time- and concentration-dependence of organic radical formation, as well as by additional experiments observing the formation of Fe2+ and ascorbate radicals in mixtures of ascorbate and Fe3+. &#183;OH and superoxide were found to be efficiently scavenged by antioxidants.Wildfire PM mainly generated &#183;OH and R&#183; with minor contributions from superoxide and oxygen-centered organic radicals (RO&#183;). PM OP was high in wildfire PM, exhibiting very weak correlation with radical forms of ROS. These results were in stark contrast with PM collected at highway and urban sites, which generated much higher amounts of radicals dominated by &#183;OH radicals that correlated well with OP. By combining field measurements of size-segregated chemical composition, a human respiratory tract model, and kinetic modeling, we quantified production rates and concentrations of different types of ROS in different regions of the ELF by considering particle-size-dependent respiratory deposition. While hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and &#183;O2- production were governed by Fe and Cu ions, &#183;OH radicals were mainly generated by organic compounds and Fenton-like reactions of metal ions. We obtained mixed results for correlations between PM OP and ROS formation, providing rationale and limitations of the use of oxidative potential as an indicator for PM toxicity in epidemiological and toxicological studies.Quinones and isoprene SOA activated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in macrophages, releasing massive amounts of superoxide via respiratory burst and overwhelming the superoxide formation by aqueous chemical reactions in the ELF. The threshold dose for macrophage activation was much smaller for quinones compared with isoprene SOA. The released ROS caused lipid peroxidation to increase cell membrane fluidity, inducing oxidative damage and stress. Further increases of doses led to the activation of antioxidant response elements, reducing the net cellular superoxide production. At very high doses and long exposure times, chemical production became comparably important or dominant if the escalation of oxidative stress led to cell death.The mechanistic understandings and quantitative information on ROS generation by SOA particles provided a basis for further elucidation of adverse aerosol health effects and oxidative stress by PM2.5. For a comprehensive assessment of PM toxicity and health effects via oxidative stress, it is important to consider both chemical reactions and cellular processes for the formation of ROS in the ELF. Chemical composition of PM strongly influences ROS formation; further investigations are required to study ROS formation from various PM sources. Such research will provide critical information to environmental agencies and policymakers for the development of air quality policy and regulation.</description>

However, in the first models, Alfv&#233;n waves were only considered as current carriers. It is only after the Voyager missions that the possibility of complex reflection patterns was considered and their ability to accelerate particles became fully appreciated only recently. In this chapter, we review the history of our understanding of the various cases of moon&#8211;magnetosphere interactions in our Solar System. The presence of the largest of these moons in the stream of the magnetospheric plasma generates powerful large-scale Alfv&#233;n waves, which can break up into smaller scales, reflect off density gradients and accelerate particles, which ultimately impact the atmosphere of the planet to generate auroras and trigger radio emissions. The best known case is the Io&#8211;Jupiter interaction, since its observational signatures are the richest and most obvious. As our means of investigation have improved, signatures of similar interactions have also been discovered for the other Galilean moons, as well as for moons orbiting Saturn. Interestingly, similar interactions can occur on rare occasions between the planets themselves and the solar wind, and most likely take place in exo-planetary systems as well.

The three situations are discussed separately for Earth and Sun based on selected recent literature. The subsequent comparisons reveal that there is little direct comparability, neither for the excitation processes, nor for the absorption processes. This is owed to several important differences in density, magnetic mirror ratio, Pedersen conductivity, and uncertainties about the real quantities. Furthermore, the Sun possesses some configurational and dynamical properties without counterpart at the Earth. Nevertheless, the comparisons help identifying some of the shortcomings of present days' concepts and may encourage new routes to pursue. The latter applies in particular to the coupling of spicules and jets to Alfv&#233;n waves and to the effects of unbalanced currents along coronal loops. References Alfv&#233;n , H. ( 1947 ).
