      <title>Computational screening of transition metal atom doped ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures as promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1039/d4ra04011b</link>
      <description>Feifei Xia, Shu Li, Fengli Yang, Yingpin Wen, Chunzhi Zheng, RSC Advances. 14(40)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402491900

                The design of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts showing high catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance for developing new renewable energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, based on the first principles calculations, we systematically explored the electrocatalytic activity of a series of transition metal atom (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd and Pt)-doped ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures for OER and ORR. The calculated results revealed that Ni- and Pt-doped ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures exhibit promising electrocatalytic performance for both OER and ORR in comparison to the pristine ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures. Especially, the OER/ORR overpotentials of Ni-doped ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures are estimated to be 0.28/0.30 and 0.31/0.31 V, respectively, disclosing their great potential as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, it is found that Ni-doped ZnS and ZnSe nanostructures for OER and ORR are on the top of the volcano plots, evincing promising catalytic performance. Our results provide theoretical insights into a feasible strategy to synthesize highly efficient ZnS- and ZnSe-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in the future.</description>

      <title>Artificial Photosynthetic Cell with Molecular Biomimetic Thylakoid</title>

                The construction of solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion system by mimicking the photosynthetic network of the chloroplast holds great promise on efficient solar energy utilization. We developed an artificial photosynthetic cell (APC) based on molecular biomimetic thylakoid (CoTPP&#8208;FePy) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen (H2 and O2) at low driving voltage (1.1 V) and neutral condition (pH&#8776;7). The CoTPP&#8208;FePy can emulate the light reaction in thylakoids to produce O2 by coupling light harvesting, photocatalysis, and electron/energy storage (FeIII/FeII&#8208;Py). Subsequently, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were employed to simulate the dark reaction, wherein the proton, electron and energy generated by the light reaction can drive the H2 producing process. By a temporally and spatially coupling of the light and dark reactions, the resulting APC achieved a solar conversion efficiency of 3.1%, exceeding that of natural photosynthetic systems and demonstrating the potential of artificial photosynthesis.</description>

                Abstract Green hydrogen (H 2 ) is an essential component of global plans to reduce carbon emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate industries and heavy transport. However, challenges remain in the highly efficient H 2 production from water electrolysis powered by renewable energies. The sluggish oxygen evolution restrains the H 2 production from water splitting. Rational electrocatalyst designs for highly efficient H 2 production and oxygen evolution are pivotal for water electrolysis. With the development of high&#8208;performance electrolyzers, the scale&#8208;up of H 2 production to an industrial&#8208;level related activity can be achieved. This review summarizes recent advances in water electrolysis such as the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). The critical challenges for PEMWE and AEMWE are the high cost of noble&#8208;metal catalysts and their durability, respectively. This review highlights the anode and cathode designs for improving the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts, the electrolyte and membrane engineering for membrane electrode assembly (MEA) optimizations, and stack systems for the most promising electrolyzers in water electrolysis. Besides, the advantages of integrating water electrolyzers, fuel cells (FC), and regenerative fuel cells (RFC) into the hydrogen ecosystem are introduced. Finally, the perspective of electrolyzer designs with superior performance is presented.</description>

      <title>Fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide for efficient, long&#8208;lasting zinc&#8208;air batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202410978</link>
      <description>Zonglong Zhu, Jing Zhong, Li Wang, Jialun Gu, Fucong Lyu, Shengmei Chen, Haikun Wu, Lanxi Li, Chunyi Zhi, Jian L&#252;, Yang Yang Li, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402568141

                Efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are urgently needed to unlock the full potential of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). High&#8208;valence oxides (HVOs) and high entropy oxides (HEOs) are suitable candidates for their optimal electronic structures and stability but suffer from demanding synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;cost fluorine&#8208;lodged high&#8208;valent high&#8208;entropy layered double hydroxide (HV&#8208;HE&#8208;LDH) (FeCoNi2F4(OH)4) is conveniently prepared through multi&#8208;ions co&#8208;precipitation, where F&#8208; are firmly embedded into the individual hydroxide layers. Spectroscopic detections and theoretical simulations reveal high valent metal cations are obtained in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4, which enlarge the energy band overlap between metal 3d and O 2p, enhancing the electronic conductivity and charge transfer, thus affording high intrinsic OER catalytic activity. More importantly, the strengthened metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8208;O) bonds and stable octahedral geometry (M&#8208;O(F)6) in FeCoNi2F4(OH)4 prevent structural reorganization, rendering long&#8208;term catalytic stability. Furthermore, an efficient three&#8208;phase reaction interface with fast oxygen transportation was constructed, significantly improving the ORR activity. ZABs assembled with FeCoNi2F4(OH)4@HCC (hydrophobic carbon cloth) cathodes deliver a top performance with high round&#8208;trip energy efficiency (60.6% at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and long&#8208;term stability (efficiency remains at 58.8% after 1050 charge&#8208;discharge cycles).</description>

      <title>Trifunctional Graphene&#8208;Sandwiched Heterojunction&#8208;Embedded Layered Lattice Electrocatalyst for High Performance in Zn&#8208;Air Battery&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202408869</link>
      <description>Dong&#8208;Won Kim, Jihoon Kim, Jong Hui Choi, Do Hwan Jung, Jeung Ku Kang, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402568155

                Abstract Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB)&#8208;driven water splitting holds great promise as a next&#8208;generation energy conversion technology, but its large overpotential, low activity, and poor stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remain obstacles. Here, a trifunctional graphene&#8208;sandwiched, heterojunction&#8208;embedded layered lattice (G&#8208;SHELL) electrocatalyst offering a solution to these challenges are reported. Its hollow core&#8208;layered shell morphology promotes ion transport to Co 3 S 4 for OER and graphene&#8208;sandwiched MoS 2 for ORR/HER, while its heterojunction&#8208;induced internal electric fields facilitate electron migration. The structural characteristics of G&#8208;SHELL are thoroughly investigated using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images align well with the DFT&#8208;relaxed structures and simulated TEM images, further confirming its structure. It exhibits an approximately threefold smaller ORR charge transfer resistance than Pt/C, a lower OER overpotential and Tafel slope than RuO&#8322;, and excellent HER overpotential and Tafel slope, while outlasting noble metals in terms of durability. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis under varying potentials by examining the peak shifts and ratios (Co 2+ /Co 3+ and Mo 4+ /Mo 6+ ) elucidates electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms. Furthermore, the ZAB with G&#8208;SHELL outperforms Pt/C+RuO 2 in terms of energy density (797 Wh kg &#8722;1 ) and peak power density (275.8 mW cm &#8722;2 ), realizing the ZAB&#8208;driven water splitting.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multiple Strategies Using Biotechnology to Design High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202413072</link>

                Abstract Combining multiple design strategies often enhances catalyst performance but usually comes with high costs and low reproducibility. A technique that enhances catalyst performance in multiple strategies is urgently needed. Herein, a novel bioregulation technique is introduced, allowing simultaneous control over morphology, particle size, doping, interface engineering, and electronic properties. Bioregulation technique utilizes the soluble extracellular polymer from Aspergillus niger as a templating agent to construct high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). This technique controls catalyst morphology, introduces biological N and S doping, and regulates the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Biomolecule modification enhances surface hydrophilicity, and the nanostructure increases surface roughness and gas&#8208;release efficiency. Theoretical calculations show that the bioregulation technique shortens the d/p&#8208;band center, optimizing reaction intermediate adsorption and desorption. The Bio&#8208;Pt/Co 3 O 4 catalyst with trace Pt on the surface, designed with these strategies, achieves HER ( &#951; 10 of 42 mV), OER ( &#951; 10 of 221 mV), and overall water&#8208;splitting performance (1.51 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), maintaining stability for over 50 h, outperforming most Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Notably, using spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes leachate, rich in Co 2 &#8314;, successfully replicates the experiment. This approach holds promise as a mainstream method for synthesizing high&#8208;performance materials in the future.</description>

      <title>Exploring Discharged Dry Cell as an Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ad7a56</link>
      <description>Pitchiah Esakki Karthik, Sanjit Mondal, Lipipuspa Sahoo, Materials Research Express. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402472684

                Abstract Transition metal compounds with a high affinity for oxygen in dry cell configurations, such as MnO2, Mn3O4, and ZnxMn3O4&#8722;x, exhibit exceptional electrocatalytic properties in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the disposal of these dry cell materials, unlike that of rechargeable batteries, poses environmental hazards. In this study, we focused on optimizing these manganese oxides for energy-related applications, specifically OER. To achieve this goal, we investigated the electrocatalytic behaviour of both used and fresh dry cells in OER. Our results show that the used dry cell material achieved a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 525 mV, whereas the fresh dry cell required an overpotential 100 mV higher to reach the same current density. We further characterized the nature of these fresh and used materials using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and contact angle measurements. The enhanced activity of the used dry cell can be attributed to the formation of highly active Mn3O4 from MnO2 and graphene oxide under discharging conditions.</description>

                Electrochemical approaches for generating hydrogen from water splitting can be more promising if the challenges in the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be harnessed.

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/8714253</link>

                Iron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C) catalysts have garnered attention owing to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is comparable to that of Pt/C catalysts. Among the various methods for designing Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts, the use of templates has been emphasized as a means to create hierarchical porous structures. This strategy has enabled the achievement of high ORR activity. In this study, we propose a method for manufacturing a catalyst with high ORR activity by maximizing the interactions between commercial silica templates and catalyst precursors. By manipulating the charge on the commercial silica surface and adjusting the pH of the dispersion, the catalyst fabricated through these methods exhibited superior ORR activity compared to Pt/C and recently reported nonprecious metal catalysts. Through diverse physicochemical and electrochemical analyses, we confirmed that this activity stems from the effectively generated hierarchical porous structure and the resulting high density of Fe&#9472;N active sites. This catalyst exhibited a kinetic current density of over 2.73 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is more than double that of platinum and displayed a high ORR mass activity of 4.49 mA mg &#8722;1 . This strategy holds significant potential for application in various carbon&#8208;based materials, paving the way for the development of highly efficient electrochemical energy devices.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium Dioxide (RuO 2 ), as one of the most promising alternatives to IrO 2 , suffers from the severe dissolution and overoxidation of Ru active sites during the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which hinders its practical application. Herein, the study constructs a short&#8208;range ordered tantalum single atoms&#8208;doped RuO 2 catalyst (Ta&#8208;RuO 2 ) with asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ta(&#8208;O&#8208;Ta) active units for the enhanced acidic OER. The Ta&#8208;RuO 2 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity with an overpotential of 201 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a long&#8208;lasting stability of 280 h. Physical characterizations combined with electrochemical tests reveal that the incorporation of atomically arranged Ta atoms induces significant tensile strain, effectively optimizing the adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates by regulating the Ru d &#8208;band center and weakening the Ru&#8208;O covalency, thus boosting the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the formed Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ta(&#8208;O&#8208;Ta) active local structure is well maintained during the OER process owing to the synergy of strong corrosion resistance of Ta&#8208;O bonds and the electron transfers from Ta to Ru via oxygen bridge stabilizing the Ru sites, contributing to the enhanced stability. This study provides a novel method via incorporation of corrosion&#8208;resistant and short&#8208;range ordered single atoms to significantly enhance the acidic OER stability and activity of cost&#8208;effective catalysts.</description>

      <title>Structural and Compositional Optimization of Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni Ternary Amorphous Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Evolution in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) offers a sustainable path for hydrogen production with advantages such as high current density, dynamic responsiveness, and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts. However, the development of efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under operating conditions is crucial for achieving the AEMWE. This study systematically investigated Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni ternary amorphous electrocatalysts for the OER in AEMWE through a comprehensive material library system comprising 21 composition series. The study aims to explore the relationship between composition, degree of crystallinity, and electrocatalytic activity using ternary contours and binary plots to derive optimal catalysts. The findings reveal that higher Co and lower Fe contents lead to increased structural disorder within the Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;Ni system, whereas an appropriate amount of Fe addition is necessary for OER activity. It is concluded that the amorphous structure of Fe&#8211;Co 3 &#8211;Ni possesses an optimal ternary composition and degree of crystallinity to facilitate the OER. Post&#8208;OER analyses reveal that the optimized ternary amorphous structure induces structural reconstruction into an OER&#8208;favorable OOH&#8208;rich surface. The Fe&#8211;Co 3 &#8211;Ni electrocatalysts exhibit outstanding performances in both half&#8208;cells and single&#8208;cells, with an overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722; 2 and a current density of 2.0 A cm &#8722; 2 at 1.89 V, respectively.</description>

                Understanding the structure evolution, kinetics, and mass transfer for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the ionomer-catalyst interface is fundamental for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Herein, we investigate the structural evolution of ionomer-Pt interfaces during the activation process of polycrystalline Pt (poly-Pt) electrodes and their ORR kinetics and mass transfer characteristics at steady state. The results suggest the ionomer thickness as a critical factor in determining the Pt surface structure and the flux of the O</description>

                Porous silicon (Si) has a tetrahedral structure similar to that of sp3&#8208; hybridized carbon atoms in a typical diamond structure, which affords it unique chemical and physical properties including an adjustable intrinsic bandgap, a high&#8208;speed carrier transfer efficiency. It has shown great potential in photocatalysis, rechargeable batteries, solar cells, detectors, and electrocatalysis. This review introduces various porous Si&#8208;supported electrocatalysts and analyzes the reasons why porous Si is used as a new carrier/active sites from the perspectives of its molecular structure, electronic properties, synthesis methods, etc. The electrochemical applications of porous Si&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and total water decomposition together with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors in energy storage are summarized. The challenges and future research directions for porous Si are also discussed. This review aims to deepen the understanding of porous Si and promote the development and applications of this new type of Si material.</description>

                Realizing an efficient turnover frequency in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction by modifying the reaction configuration is crucial in designing high-performance single-atom catalysts. Here, we report a "single atom-double site" concept, which involves an activatable inert manganese atom redox chemistry in a single-atom Ru-Mn dual-site platform with tunnel Ni ions as the trigger. In contrast to conventional single-atom catalysts, the proposed configuration allows direct intramolecular oxygen coupling driven by the Ni ions intercalation effect, bypassing the secondary deprotonation step instead of the kinetically sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism. The strong bonding of Ni ions activates the inert manganese terminal groups and inhibits the cross-site disproportionation process inherent in the Mn scaffolding, which is crucial to ensure the dual-site platform. As a result, the single-atom Ru-Ni-Mn octahedral molecular sieves catalyst delivers a low overpotential, adequate mass activity and good stability.</description>

                Abstract The transition to a sustainable energy economy requires the availability of renewably produced hydrogen through proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. The techno&#8208;economic viability of this technology requires addressing materials challenges regarding the lack of active and stable catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions. Herein, core&#8208;shell iridium/titanium dioxide (Core&#8208;shell Ir@TiO 2 ) catalysts for acidic OER are synthesized through a polyol method to create TiO 2 nanoparticles, followed by urea reduction with Ir, and subsequent annealing in hydrogen. The formation process of the core&#8208;shell structure is observed through in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy under annealing conditions. Ir segregation occurred from an initially blended mixed metal oxide structure to a core&#8208;shell configuration at 500 &#176;C. Core&#8208;shell Ir@TiO 2 showed a three&#8208;fold higher stability number (i.e., S&#8208;number) than commercial IrO x (3.34 &#215; 10 6 versus 1.02 &#215; 10 6 ). Furthermore, an Ir&#8208;mass normalized activity of 1,880 A g Ir &#8722;1 at 1.7 V versus RHE is measured for Core&#8208;shell Ir@TiO 2 , compared to 624 A g Ir &#8722;1 for commercial IrO x . The developed synthetic route to prepare a composite structure with a TiO 2 core and Ir&#8208;based shell has enabled an Ir content reduction without a compromise in activity and stability, thus offering a promising avenue for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts tailored for acidic water electrolysis.</description>

                Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are highly regarded as promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure features the incorporation of Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface. Strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges in the heterointerface between the &#8208;OH and &#8208;O. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8208;CoOOH@NiOOH, affords an ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity exceeding that of initial cobalt oxyhydroxide by over 11.9 times. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieves a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56% at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, remarkable durability (1000 hours at even a current density of 50 mA cm&#8208;2), and quick charge performances.</description>

                Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), praised for structural flexibility and tunability, are prominent catalyst prototypes for exploring oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their intricate transformations under OER, especially in industrial high&#8208;current environments, pose significant challenges in accurately elucidating their structure&#8208;activity correlation. Here, we harnessed an electrooxidation process for controllable MOF reconstruction, discovering that Fe doping expedites Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF structural evolution, accompanied by the elongation of Ni&#8208;O bonds, monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling further reveals that Fe doping and defect&#8208;induced tensile strain in the NiO6 octahedra augments the metal ds&#8208;Op hybridization, optimizing their adsorption behavior and augmenting OER activity. The reconstructed Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF, serving as the anode in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves a noteworthy current density of 3.3 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.2 V while maintaining equally stable operation for 160 h spanning from 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 to 1 A cm&#8208;2. This undertaking elevates our comprehension of OER catalyst reconstruction, furnishing promising avenues for designing highly efficacious catalysts across electrochemical platforms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of oxygen and stratification and their relationship in the North Pacific Ocean in CMIP6 Earth system models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3985-2024</link>

                Abstract. This study examines the linkages between the upper-ocean (0&#8211;200 m) oxygen (O2) content and stratification in the North Pacific Ocean using four Earth system models (ESMs), an ocean hindcast simulation, and an ocean reanalysis. The trends and variability in oceanic O2 content are driven by the imbalance between physical supply and biological demand. Physical supply is primarily controlled by ocean ventilation, which is responsible for the transport of O2-rich surface waters to the subsurface. Isopycnic potential vorticity (IPV), a quasi-conservative tracer proportional to density stratification that can be evaluated from temperature and salinity measurements, is used herein as a dynamical proxy for ocean ventilation. The predictability potential of the IPV field is evaluated through its information entropy. The results highlight a strong O2&#8211;IPV connection and somewhat higher (as compared to the rest of the basin) predictability potential for IPV across the tropical Pacific, where the El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation occurs. This pattern of higher predictability and strong anticorrelation between O2 and stratification is robust across multiple models and datasets. In contrast, IPV at mid-latitudes has low predictability potential and its center of action differs from that of O2. In addition, the locations of extreme events or hotspots may or may not differ between the two fields, with a strong model dependency, which persists in future projections. On the one hand, these results suggest that it may be possible to monitor ocean O2 in the tropical Pacific based on a few observational sites co-located with the more abundant IPV measurements; on the other, they lead us to question the robustness of the IPV&#8211;O2 relationship in the extratropics. The proposed framework helps to characterize and interpret O2 variability in relation to physical variability and may be especially useful in the analysis of new observation-based data products derived from the BGC-Argo float array in combination with the traditional but far more abundant Argo data.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is the most promising technology for hydrogen production, in which surface reconstruction on the interface of electrode/electrolyte plays a crucial role in activating the catalytic reactions with a low activation energy barrier. Herein, an efficient Mo modifying NiCoMo prickly flower clusters electrocatalyst supported on nickel foam (Mo-doped Ni/Co-OOH prickly flower clusters) is obtained, which serves as an eminently active and durable catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the surface reconstruction during the alkaline seawater electrolysis with ultralow overpotentials. It just requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm</description>

                The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have demonstrated significant potential as non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Their unique compositional and structural properties contribute to their efficiency and stability as catalysts. In this study, CoCuFe-LDH composites were grown on graphene (G) via a cost-effective and straightforward one-step hydrothermal process. A 2-level full-factorial model was employed to determine the impact of Co (1.5, 3, and 4.5 mmol) and graphene (10, 30, and 50 mg) concentrations on the onset potential of OER and HER, which were the chosen response variables. OER and HER activity variabilities were assessed in triplicate using Co</description>

                Abstract A binder&#8208;free Ru@NiMoS electrode was engineered by in situ growth of two&#8208;dimensional NiMoS nanosheets on nickel foam. This process effectively promoted the electrostatic&#8208;driven aggregation of Ru(bpy) 3 2+ , harnessing the synergistic effect to enhance electrochemiluminescence (ECL) performance. The integration (Ru@NiMoS) achieved an impressive ECL efficiency of 70.1%, marking an impressive 36.9&#8208;fold enhancement over conventional Ru. Additionally, its ECL intensity was found to be remarkably 172.2 times greater than that of Ru. Within the Ru(bpy) 3 2+ /TPA system, NiMoS emerged as a pivotal electrochemical catalyst, markedly boosting both the oxygen evolution reaction and the generation of reactive intermediates. Leveraging these distinctive properties, a highly efficient ECL sensor for lidocaine detection was developed. This sensor exhibited a linear response within the concentration range of 1 nM to 1 &#956;M and achieved a remarkably low detection limit of 0.22 nM, underlining its substantial potential for practical application.</description>

                This mini-review briefly discusses the catalytic properties of polyampholytes, polyampholyte-metal complexes, polyampholyte-metal nanoparticles and polyampholyte-catalase conjugates. Polyampholyte-based catalysts can mimic enzyme functions, facilitating reactions like hydrolysis, decomposition, hydrogenation, and oxidation of various substrates. Special focus is given to amphoteric hydrogels and cryogels that encapsulate metal nanoparticles or enzymes. These materials have demonstrated effectiveness in the hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds, oxidation of disulfide and aliphatic (or aromatic) alcohols under mild conditions, both in batch and flow-through reactors. Kinetic parameters, turnover numbers (TON), turnover frequencies (TOF), and activation energies are presented for a series of specific catalytic processes. Notably, flow-through reactors exhibit significantly higher catalytic efficiency compared to batch reactors and can be used continuously for extended periods. Additionally, the review explores the potential of light-driven hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions from water, facilitated by metal nanoparticles within amphoteric hydrogels in the presence of photosensitizers.</description>

                Abstract The increasing need for sustainable energy and the transition from a linear to a circular economy pose great challenges to the materials science community. In this view, the chance of producing efficient nanocatalysts for water splitting using industrial waste as starting material is attractive. Here, we report low-cost processes to convert Mo-based industrial waste powder into efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). pH controlled hydrothermal processing of Mo-based industrial waste powder leads to pure orthorhombic MoO 3 nanobelts (50&#8211;200 nm wide, 10 &#181;m long) with promising OER performances at 10 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 with an overpotential of 324 mV and Tafel slope of 45 mV&#183;dec &#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte. Indeed, MoS 2 /MoO 3 nanostructures were obtained after sulfurization during hydrothermal processes of the MoO 3 nanobelts. HER tests in acidic environment show a promising overpotential of 208 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 94 mV&#183;dec &#8722;1 . OER and HER performances of nanocatalysts obtained from Mo industrial waste powder are comparable or better than Mo-based nanocatalysts obtained from pure commercial Mo reagent. This work shows the great potential of reusing industrial waste for energy applications, opening a promising road to join waste management and efficient and sustainable nanocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

                CO 2 -tolerant rechargeable Lithium-Air batteries are seen as a high-performing alternative to Li-ion batteries. They utilize O 2 from the air, reducing it at the cathode to form lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) during discharge which is then oxidized to form lithium-metal and freeing O 2 during charging. Most of the present studies involve pure O 2 as the cathode material instead of aerial O 2 , which has a stiff-challenge due to atmospheric CO 2 which produces Li 2 CO 3 during discharge, posing a resistive load on the battery if not re-oxidized on charging. Ideally, presence of CO 2 should enhance the charge-storage capacity if it is cycled reversibly. Thus, present research aims at taking advantage of both O 2 and CO 2 by employing metallic Cu on CuFe 2 O 4 catalyst, synthesized from a one-step auto-combustion route. The Cu metal present in the catalyst leads to a low surface-area, yet the catalyst demonstrates excellent oxygen reduction reaction and moderate oxygen evolution reaction activity. excellent CO 2 reduction reaction activity, oxidizing both the Li 2 O 2 and the Li 2 CO 3 during charge in both 10% CO 2 and 100% CO 2 atmospheres. The fabricated Li-CO 2 battery operates for practical application, suggesting the suitability of the catalyst for the transition from practical Li-O 2 battery to Li-Air battery.</description>

                Abstract Monitoring the dynamic behavior of active species and modulating their electronic architecture are crucial for the development of efficient catalysts. Here, a 3D ordered multi&#8208;level porous Ni 2 P/CeO 2 heterojunction catalyst with a &#8220;self&#8208;optimization effect&#8221; is strategically synthesized for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 235 mV at 20 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH. During the OER process, the heterojunction catalyst specifically undergoes a unique phase transition involving the leaching of the P element, which triggers the formation of the PO 4 3&#8722; &#8208;NiOOH/CeO 2 catalyst with PO 4 3&#8722; adsorbed on the surface of the reconstructed product NiOOH/CeO 2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal that the CeO 2 and adsorbed&#8208;PO 4 3&#8722; in the self&#8208;optimized structure are essential and minor factors for enhancing catalytic activity, respectively. They collaborate to promote the redistribution of electron density in surface Ni and O, increasing the d / p &#8208;band center difference. This phenomenon results in optimized adsorption/desorption of the key intermediates such as *OOH and improved catalytic performance. Overall, this research highlights the potential of d / p &#8208;band modulation for the rational design of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.</description>

                Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in clean energy conversion and storage systems. Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are highly regarded as promising electrocatalysts for the UOR. However, their effectiveness is significantly hindered by the unavoidable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of nickel species during UOR. To address this challenge, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to boost UOR kinetics by creating a high&#8208;energy interfacial heterostructure. This heterostructure features the incorporation of Ag at the CoOOH@NiOOH heterojunction interface. Strong interactions significantly promote the electron exchanges in the heterointerface between the &#8208;OH and &#8208;O. Consequently, the improved electron delocalization led to the formation of stronger bonds between Co sites and urea CO(NH2)2, promoting a preference for urea to occupy Co active sites over OH*. The resulting catalyst, Ag&#8208;CoOOH@NiOOH, affords an ultrahigh UOR activity with a low potential of 1.33 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. The fabricated catalyst exhibits a mass activity exceeding that of initial cobalt oxyhydroxide by over 11.9 times. The rechargeable urea&#8208;assisted zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) achieves a record&#8208;breaking energy efficiency of 74.56% at 1 mA cm&#8208;2, remarkable durability (1000 hours at even a current density of 50 mA cm&#8208;2), and quick charge performances.</description>

      <title>Direct Evidence for Buffer-Enhanced Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in Metal Aquo Bond Formation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-l776x</link>

                Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions play a crucial role in the interconversion of metal-aqua and metal-hydroxo species present in transition metal complexes and oxide surfaces (M(III)-OH + e&#8722; + H+ M(II)-OH2). For ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts, PCET reactions involved in the mechanism of oxygen evolution have demonstrated a strong dependence on the identity and concentration of the proton donor and acceptor with significant rate enhancements observed for electrocatalysis performed in acetate, phosphate, and borate buffered electrolytes. However, the systematic study of this phenomenon has been hampered by the inability to independently measure discrete rates for electron transfer (ET) and proton transfer (PT) under electrochemical applied potentials. Herein, the PCET kinetics and mechanism of metal aqua bond formation in a ruthenium water oxidation catalyst [Ru(tpy)(bpy&#8242;)H2O]2+, Ru(II)&#8722;OH2 where tpy is 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;-terpyridine and bpy&#8242; is 4,4&#8242;-diaminopropylsilatrane-2,2&#8242;-bypyridine were investigated at a conductive metal oxide interface as a function of buffer identity and concentration. The reaction of interest was triggered by visible light excitation of the catalyst and the kinetics of the independent ET and PT steps of the PCET mechanism were determined through nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Kinetic measurements performed in aqueous acetate, phosphate, or borate buffer solutions revealed two distinct regimes of PT kinetics solely dependent on the buffer concentration. At the greatest buffer concentrations investigated (2 M acetate) spectral signals corresponding to the discreet ET and PT steps were absent indicative in a change in underlying PCET mechanism. Likewise, kinetic modeling indicated that PT from protonated acetate or phosphate occurred with rate constants that were 2-4 orders of magnitude greater than those for bulk water. In all, these results suggest that the presence of buffer-bases can significantly enhance PCET rates and, in this reaction, may alter the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>A perspective to efficient synthesis of zirconium carbide via novel pyro-vacuum method: lower temperatures and enhanced purity</title>

                The use of ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) as a novel additive in the refractory industry is becoming increasingly popular. However, the synthesis of such materials is associated with some commercial obstacles, mainly high-temperature synthesis methods. In the present study, the pyro-vacuum method is presented as a new method to decrease the final product's synthesis temperature and oxygen content. Some thermodynamic aspects and phase evolution of the materials during the synthesis procedure are described for the synthesis of non-oxide material. Conclusively, it seems that by applying vacuum conditions, the final UHTC phases can be synthesized at significantly lower temperatures (&gt;400 &#176;C lower, for ZrC), if adequate powder mixtures are considered. Also due to phase analysis, it was found that the oxygen content of the final phase is lower than the conventional routes and other references. The process provides promising prospects for the economic synthesis of UHTCs.</description>

      <title>Regulation via repression: Regulator of symbiosome differentiation (RSD) acts as zone-specific repressor to mediate nodule development</title>

                This talk will be pre-recorded, with virtual Q A. Medicago truncatula forms indeterminate nodules having successive development zones. Indeterminate nodules maintain an oxygen gradient to uncouple symbiosome differentiation at invasion zone and nitrogen fixation at fixation zone. The oxygen gradient maxima to minima from apex to base of nodule length depends on *leghemoglobins (LgHbs )* expression which is responsible for oxygen buffering as LgHbs create micro-oxic environment. In this study, we demonstrate the mode of action of Regulator of Symbiosome Differentiation (RSD), a transcriptional repressor. RSD interacts with Nodule Inception (NIN) and NIN-like protein 2 (NLP2). Studies confirm NIN-NLP2 activate *LgHbs* expression. RSD expression and protein localization remains confined within invasion and interzone. We identified this zone-specific expression of RSD is crucial as RSD represses *LgHb* expression at invasion zone. Manipulation of the stoichiometry of RSD, NIN, and NLP2 in planta disrupts *LgHb* expression and impairs functional nodule development. To unravel, the dynamics of the invasion zone-specific regulation, we performed translatome and transcriptome profiling using the RSD promoter, to identify putative targets of RSD. Collectively, our findings suggest that RSD-mediated repression of NIN and NLP2-targets are crucial for symbiosome differentiation. RSD recruitment in the nitrogen-fixing clade also recommends its evolution during nodulation and conserved functionality in other legume species as well. Thus RSD, as a repressor from its invasion zone optimizes the genetic network crucial for functional nodule development.</description>

                Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials gain increasing attention as water splitting photocatalysts for hydrogen production. We use first-principles calculations to predict a stable 2D Janus $T$-TiNBr structure, with strong near-ultraviolet sunlight absorption and band edges that align favorably with the water redox potentials for oxygen and hydrogen evolution. We show that the optical and electronic properties of $T$-TiNBr can be modulated to a certain extend by applying external uniaxial strain. Explicit calculations of the redox reactions reveal that solar-driven water splitting is viable at the N-side of $T$-TiNBr, while the Br-side requires modifications such as vacancy creation, the application of an external potential, or adjustment of the pH conditions.</description>

                We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits of the Meissner phase for two superconducting niobium (Nb) samples. The samples are processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavity applications-a "baseline" treatment and an oxygen-doping ("O-doping") treatment. The measurements show: (1) that the screening length is significantly longer in the "O-doping" sample compared to the "baseline" sample; (2) that the screening length near the limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; (3) the evolution of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase to the mixed phase; and (4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the</description>

                Leiomyomas are benign mesenchymal tumors that occur as the most common uterine neoplasm in women of reproductive age. Depending on its growth, its blood supply may be compromised, causing degenerative changes due to lack of oxygen, which gives it an atypical appearance that may cause confusion with the diagnosis. The case of a 47-year-old patient is described, who consults for a progressive increase in the volume of abdominal circumference of 7 months of evolution, referred to the gynecology oncology consultation due to a large retrouterine tumor mass of probable ovarian origin with a high risk of malignancy. After performing preoperative studies, she was taken to the operating room, obtaining as a definitive diagnosis, leiomyoma with hyaline and focal hydropic degeneration.

                According to the proposed pyrolytic method, granular activated carbon (AC) Norit 830 W was functionalized by thermal treatment of AC in hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases, pentafluoroethane and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, at 400-800 &#176;C. This method does not require activation by plasma and photons. Chemical and elemental analysis showed that the pyrolytic treatment provides a loading of 2.95 mmol (5.6 wt%) of fluorine per gram of AC. Nitrogen adsorption measurements indicated that the microporous structure contracted when AC was treated with HFC at temperatures above 400 &#176;C. Thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with attenuated total reflectance (ATR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated the evolution of oxygen-containing and fluorine-containing groups to more thermostable groups with treatment temperature. The fluorine-containing groups grafted at high temperature, above 600 &#176;C exhibited the highest thermal stability up to 1250 &#176;C in dry argon.

      <title>Treatment of domestic wastewater and extracellular polymeric substance accumulation in siphon&#8208;type composite vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/wer.11132</link>
      <description>Hao Chen, Lin Qiu, Hong Wu, Fahui Nie, Yong Liu, Wenping Cao, Water Environment Research. 96(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402570326

                Abstract In this study, the siphon&#8208;type composite vertical flow constructed wetland (Sc&#8208;VSsFCW) was constructed with anthracite and shale ceramsite chosen as the substrate bed materials. During the 90&#8208;day experiment, typical pollutant removal effects of wastewater and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) accumulation were investigated. Meanwhile, X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the phase composition and surface morphology to analyze adsorptive property. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of siphon effluent on clogging and depolymerization by measuring the EPS components' evolution within the system. The findings reveal that both the anthracite and shale ceramsite systems exhibit impressive removal efficiencies for total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 + &#8208;N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 &#8722; &#8208;N). However, as the experiment progressed, TP removal rates in both systems gradually declined because of the saturation of adsorption sites on the substrate surfaces. Although the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels remained relatively stable throughout the experiment, pH exhibited distinct patterns, suggesting that the anthracite system relies primarily on chemical adsorption, whereas the shale ceramsite system predominantly utilizes physical adsorption. After an initial period of fluctuation, the permeability coefficient and porosity of the system gradually stabilized, and the protein and polysaccharide contents in both systems exhibited a downward trend. The study underscores that anthracite and shale ceramsite have good effectiveness in pollutant removal as substrate materials. Overall, the hydraulic conditions of the double repeated oxygen coupling siphon in the Sc&#8208;VSsFCW system contribute to enhanced re&#8208;oxygenation capacity and permeability coefficient during operation. The changes in EPS content indicate that the siphon effluent exerts a certain depolymerization effect on the EPS within the system, thereby mitigating the risk of biological clogging to a certain extent. Practitioner Points The system can still maintain good pollutant treatment effect in long&#8208;term operation. The re&#8208;oxygenation method of the system can achieve efficient and long&#8208;term re&#8208;oxygenation effect. The siphon effluent has a certain improvement effect on the permeability coefficient and porosity, but it cannot effectively inhibit the occurrence of clogging. The EPS content did not change significantly during the operation of the system, and there was a risk of biological clogging.</description>

      <title>Ferric Iron Evolution During Crystallization of the Earth and Mars</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2023je008262</link>
      <description>Laura Schaefer, Kaveh Pahlevan, L. T. Elkins&#8208;Tanton, Journal of Geophysical Research Planets. 129(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402525918

                Abstract Magma ocean crystallization models that track f O 2 evolution can reproduce the D/H ratios of both the Earth and Mars without the need for exogenous processes. Fractional crystallization leads to compositional evolution of the bulk oxide components. Recent work suggests that metal&#8208;saturated magma oceans may contain near&#8208;present&#8208;day Fe 3+ concentrations. We model the fractional crystallization of Earth and Mars, including Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ as separate components. We calculate Fe 3+ partition coefficients for lower mantle minerals and compare the results of fractional crystallization for both Earth and Mars. We calculate oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) at the surface as the systems evolve and compare them to constraints on the f O 2 of the last magma ocean atmosphere from D/H ratios, both with and without metal saturation. For Earth, we find that Fe 3+ likely behaves incompatibly in the lower mantle in order to match the D/H constraint for whole mantle models, but shallow magma ocean models also provide reasonable matches. Disproportionation in whole mantle magma oceans likely overpredicts the amount of Fe 3+ and metal that form or require subsequent reduction to return to present&#8208;day values. For Mars, we cannot match the D/H constraints on last f O 2 unless the magma ocean begins with &lt;50% of the predicted Fe 3+ , but better match the present day mantle redox. We show that Fe 3+ partitioning has a measurable effect on magma ocean redox, and that it evolves throughout the magma ocean's lifetime. We highlight the need for additional experimental constraints on ferric iron mineral/melt partitioning and more thermodynamic data for the Fe&#8208;disproportionation reaction.</description>

      <title>The Star&#8211;Planet Composition Connection</title>

                The mantra &#8220;know thy star, know thy planet&#8221; has proven to be very important for many aspects of exoplanet science. Here I review how stellar abundances inform our understanding of planet composition and, thus, formation and evolution. In particular, I discuss how: &#9642; The strongest star&#8211;planet connection is still the giant planet&#8211;metallicity correlation, the strength of which may indicate a break point between the formation of planets versus brown dwarfs. &#9642; We do not have very good constraints on the lower metallicity limit for planet formation, although new statistics from TESS are helping, and it appears that, at low [Fe/H], &#945; elements can substitute for iron as seeds for planet formation. &#9642; The depletion of refractory versus volatile elements in stellar photospheres (particularly the Sun) was initially suggested as a sign of small planet formation but is challenging to interpret, and small differences in binary star compositions can be attributed mostly to processes other than planet formation. &#9642; We can and should go beyond comparisons of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio in giant planets and their host stars, incorporating other volatile and refractory species to better constrain planet formation pathways. &#9642; There appears to be a positive correlation between small planet bulk density and host star metallicity, but exactly how closely small planet refractory compositions match those of their host stars&#8212;and their true diversity&#8212;is still uncertain.</description>

      <title>Modeling and 3-D simulation of petroleum coke calcination process: investigation of the effect of main operating variables</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1515/ijcre-2024-0016</link>
      <description>Mohammad Hosein Eghbal Ahmadi, Shokoufe Tayyebi, Amir Mosayebi, International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402507204

                Abstract Coke calcination is a process that involves heating green petroleum coke to purify it and eliminate volatile materials for subsequent processing. Due to the complexity of the rotary kiln used in this process, conducting experimental studies can be challenging and restricted. However, quantitative analyses based on developed models can provide a foundation for optimizing and controlling the process, which can significantly enhance the design efficiency. A three-dimensional simulation model of a rotary calcining kiln for petroleum coke was created using COMSOL Multiphysics in a steady-state mode. This model accounted for all relevant physical and chemical phenomena in the gas stream and coke bed flow, including heat transfer, combustion, and the evolution of volatile matter and coke dust. The mathematical modeling yielded distributions of temperature and mass fractions within the kiln, as well as the velocity field. The results revealed two distinct peak temperatures in the gas phase: 1,780 K near the primary air injection point and 1,605 K near the tertiary air injection points. The findings were analyzed, and the impact of key variables was explored. The simulation data indicated that for every decrease of 10&#8211;15 m/s in air flow, the gas peak temperature dropped by approximately 100&#176;. Additionally, an increase in the input oxygen concentration led to enhanced combustion, resulting in higher peak concentrations of CO 2 . The developed simulation model has proven to be a valuable and promising tool for the design and optimization of petroleum coke rotary kilns.</description>

      <title>Macroalgae from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/spp2.1585</link>
      <description>Gaorong Li, Fan Wei, Jason Guo, Peiyun Cong, Papers in Palaeontology. 10(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402484130

                Abstract The Chengjiang biota, a Burgess Shale&#8208;type Lagerst&#228;tte in eastern Yunnan, South China (Cambrian Series 2, Stage 3), provides valuable information regarding the origin and early evolution of metazoans, and complex marine ecosystems. Although the major animal phyla in the Chengjiang biota have been extensively studied, macroalgae have received comparatively little attention. Here, we establish new taxa Yunnanospirellus typica and Y . elegans , describe five genera and six species ( Tawuia sp., Morania fragmenta , Liulingjitaenia alloplecta , Longfengshania stipitata , Lo . spheria and Paralongfengshania sicyoides ) not previously reported in the Chengjiang biota, and elucidate the pith structure of Enteromophites intestinalis . With 13 genera and 17 species now recorded, macroalgae rank fourth in species&#8208;level biodiversity in the Chengjiang biota (behind Euarthropoda, Porifera and Priapulida). Macroalgae account for 71.57% of total abundance, far more than all other animal phyla in the Chengjiang biota. Fuxianospira is the most dominant genus, accounting for 52.01% of all macroalgae specimens. Unattached (floating, planktonic or drifting) forms dominate (eight attached; nine unattached species). The high diversity of attached macroalgae indicates that the macroalgal communities adapted to the Proterozoic firm substrate (probably covered by microbial mats) persisted from the Ediacaran to the early Cambrian, providing compelling evidence for the existence of firm substrate during this time. Meanwhile, the blooming of unattached macroalgae in the Chengjiang biota suggests that other niches were also rich in macroalgae. Unattached macroalgae might have provided oxygen and energy to metazoans, eventually leading to ecological expansion in the upper and middle water column of the early Cambrian seas.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Defect&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Chemical Bond Construction in Chalcogenide Heterojunction for Alcohol Photooxidation Coupled with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production</title>

                Abstract Rationally designing nanostructures based on an adequate understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships is key for directional charge transfer regulation in heterojunction photocatalysts. A general strategy is developed for synthesizing bifunctional Sv&#8208;chalcogenide/Ti 3 C 2 Schottky junctions (Sv = sulfur vacancies, chalcogenides containing CdS, CdIn 2 S 4 , ZnIn 2 S 4 , ZnS, CuInS 2 ) featuring a giant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) via defect&#8208;mediated heterocomponent anchorage, which consists of sulfur vacancy modulation of chalcogenides and Ti 3 C 2 nanoparticle anchoring at defects via interfacial Metal&#9472;Oxygen (M&#9472;O) bonds. These heterojunctions have the distinctive interface structure of semicoherent phase boundaries and a directionally aligned BIEF pointing from chalcogenides to Ti 3 C 2 . The enhanced BIEF creates an asymmetrical charge distribution, which not only governs the charge migration behavior by enabling charge carrier localization and delocalized electron transport continuity but also regulates the molecular catalytic behavior by optimizing pivotal intermediate adsorption/activation ( * Ar&#8208;CH(R 2 )&#8208;OH in dehydrogenation and H * in H 2 evolution) in selective alcohol photooxidation coupled with H 2 generation. Encouragingly, Sv&#8208;chalcogenide/Ti 3 C 2 exhibits unprecedented performance (up to 13.34&#8208;fold higher efficiency than unmodulated chalcogenides) and good substrate compatibility for various alcohols. This work demonstrates the synergistic effects of surface electron density control and interfacial interaction modulation in regulating BIEFs, elucidating the substantial impact of reinforced BIEF on carrier transport properties and molecular catalytic behavior.</description>

      <title>The oxygen paradox in alkaline zinc-air battery via the competition of an unidentified anodic chemical reduction with cathodic kinetics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2rxlx</link>

                Can the fuel in use adversely affect the performance of an energy storage system? Here, oxygen (O2) in zinc-air (O2) battery (ZAB) is shown to impact the anodic process adversely, leading to early cell failure, though its amount limiting can affect the cathodic reaction kinetics. An unexplored chemical reduction process of dissolved O2 on metallic zinc in alkaline medium leading to peroxide radical (O2&#729;&#175;) species generation is proven, by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) and hydrodynamic voltammetry studies, followed by the formation of ZnO passivation layer on the Zn surface causing cell death. Keeping similar discharge times, early ZnO passivation occurred on the ZAB with its anode kept in an O2 rich environment than in the other one of O2 free environment. A slight modification in the cell design ensuring the limited availability of O2 at anode provided ~5 times extended cyclability (~7 hours to ~35 hours) than the ZAB with no such control leading to enhanced specific capacity. Presence of O2 in the anodic compartment leads to early cell failure from passivating ZnO formation impeding charge transfer. Limiting the O2 transfer from the cathodic side to anodic compartment can extend the cell cyclability and enhance discharge capacity. As alkaline ZABs are proposed for applications ranging from portable hearing aids to mini-grids, with self-discharge from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on metallic Zn as a major roadblock, this study unravels predominant parasitic chemical process by O2 on the Zn surface, highlighting the importance of cathodic O2 crossover inhibition in the alkaline ZAB.</description>
