      <title>NiIr nanowire assembles as an efficient electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.202400851</link>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the rate&#8208;limiting step in water electrolysis due to its sluggish kinetic, and it is challenging to develop an OER catalyst that could work efficiently in both acid and alkaline environment. Herein, NiIr nanowire assembles (NAs) with unique nanoflower morphology were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. As a result, the NiIr NAs exhibited superior OER activity in both acid and alkaline media. Specifically, in 0.1 M HClO4, NiIr NAs presented a superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of merely 242 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope of only 58.1 mV dec&#8208;1, surpassing that of commercial IrO2 and pure Ir NAs. And it achieved a significantly higher mass activity of 148.40 A/g at &#8208;1.5 V versus RHE. In 1.0 M KOH, NiIr NAs has an overpotential of 291 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec&#8208;1. Such remarkable activity makes the NiIr NAs among the best of recently reported representative Ir&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed alloying effect promotes surface bonding of NiIr with oxygen&#8208;containing reactants, resulting in excellent catalytic properties.</description>

      <title>Trance Amount of Ir Decorated NiFe Phosphide In&#8208;Situ Grown on Carbon Cloth as Cost&#8208;Effective Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202403022</link>

                Cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is a key constituent to establish the balance of cost and catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via water electrolysis in the area of energy conversion and storage. NiFe phosphide decorated with trace amount of iridium (Ir) species in&#8208;situ grown on carbon cloth was prepared by a facile wet chemistry approach followed by a phosphorization post&#8208;treatment at a relative low temperature. The optimal electrocatalyst, Ir2&#8208;NiFePx/CC, exhibits excellent OER activity, with an low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for alkaline OER, and a desirable long&#8208;term durability over 90 h. The outstanding OER performance stems from the structural evolution via phosphorization process, Ir decoration with more high&#8208;valence stated Ir4+ species, and tight connection between individual components of the electrode, which gives rise to the strong activity to the active sites and faster reaction kinetics in the alkaline OER process. Mover, the Ir loading was as low as approximately ~1.7 wt% (0.29 mg cm&#8208;2), showing promissing propective in cost&#8208;effective OER.</description>

                Development of high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial to realizing the electrolytic water cycle. C60 is an ideal substrate material for single atom catalysts (SACs) due to its unique electron-withdrawing properties and spherical structure. In this work, we screened for a novel single-atom catalyst based on C60, which anchored transition metal atoms in the C60 molecule by coordination with N atoms. Through first-principles calculations, we evaluated the stability and activity of MN4&#8211;C54 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, Pt, Ir, Au). The results indicate that CuN4&#8211;C54, which is based only on earth-abundant elements, exhibited low overpotentials of 0.46 and 0.47 V for the OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered a promising bifunctional catalyst, showing better performance than the noble-metal ones. In addition, according to the linear relationship of intermediates, we established volcano plots to describe the activity trends of the OER and ORR on MN4&#8211;C54. Finally, d-band center and crystal orbital Hamiltonian populations methods were used to explain the catalytic origin. Suitable d-band centers lead to moderate adsorption strength, further leading to good catalytic performances.</description>

                Developing cost-effective, readily available materials for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is a crucial step toward enhancing the profitability and sustainability of energy conversion systems. This research introduces a novel synthesis method for NiFeP/NPC OHs from banana peel bio-waste, a method that could revolutionize the field of materials science and electrochemistry. The use of metallic phosphides, known for their excellent electrical conductivity and catalytic activity, as bifunctional catalysts, combined with the efficient synthesis of nanoporous carbons (NPC) from banana peel bio-waste (BPW), could pave the way for a new era of sustainable and cost-effective energy conversion. By chemically activating different porogens, such as nickel, iron, and phosphorus (NiFeP), to form (oxy) hydroxides (OHs), functional carbonaceous structures with a high density of pores and large specific surface areas can be achieved. The resulting materials, designated as NiFeP/NPC OHs, are characterized by their remarkable porosity, high conductivity, large surface area, and chemical stability. These properties make NiFeP/NPC OHs particularly suitable for electrocatalysis, where they exhibit outstanding activity in both HER and OER. The optimized NiFeP/NPC OHs material shows a very low overpotential of 93 mV for HER and 243 mV for OER at 10 mA cm&#8315;</description>

      <title>Partially Amorphous Ru&#8208;Doped CoSe Nanoparticles with Optimized Intermediates Adsorption for Highly Efficient Sulfur Oxidation Reaction</title>

                Abstract The application of thermodynamically more favorable sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrocatalytic water electrolysis is an appealing strategy to achieve low&#8208;energy hydrogen production while removing toxic sulfur ions from wastewater. However, the study of SOR catalysts with both activity and stability still faces great challenges. Herein, this study prepares partially amorphous Ru&#8208;doped CoSe (pa&#8208;Ru&#8208;CoSe) nanoparticles for SOR. The doping of Ru keeps Co in an electron&#8208;deficient state, which enhances the adsorption of SOR intermediates and improves the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the partially amorphous selenide possesses great corrosion resistance to sulfur species, thus ensuring stability in long&#8208;term SOR. In addition, the pa&#8208;Ru&#8208;CoSe requires only 0.566 V to reach a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in the SOR&#8208;HER coupled system and remains stable for 200 h. This work provides a promising partially amorphous strategy for SOR catalysts with both catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability, enabling hydrogen production with low energy consumption and simultaneous sulfur production.</description>

      <title>Quaternary Mixed Oxides of Non-Noble Metals with Enhanced Stability during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c10234</link>

                Robust electrocatalysts required to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during water electrolysis are still a missing component toward the path for sustainable hydrogen production. Here a new family of OER active quaternary mixed-oxides based on X&#8211;Sn&#8211;Mo&#8211;Sb (X = Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) is reported. These nonstoichiometric mixed oxides form a rutile-type crystal structure with a random atomic motif and diverse oxidation states, leading to the formation of cation vacancies and local disorder. The successful incorporation of all cations into a rutile structure was achieved using oxidizing agents that facilitates the formation of Sb5+ required to form the characteristic octahedral coordination in rutile. The mixed oxides exhibit enhanced stability in both acidic and alkaline environments under anodic potentials with no changes in their crystal structure after extensive electrochemical stress. The improved stability of these mixed oxides highlights their potential application as scaffolds to host and stabilize OER active metals.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyser (PEMWE) possesses great significance for the production of high purity of hydrogen. To expedite the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that involved multiple electron&#8211;proton&#8208;coupled process, efficient and stable electrocatalysts are highly desired. Currently, noble&#8208;metal Ir&#8208;based materials are the benchmark anode due to its corrosion&#8208;resistant property and favourable combination of activity/stability. However, the large&#8208;scale deployment of PEMWE is usually constrained due to the use of the scarcest element iridium. In this review, we disclose the current research progress towards the non&#8208;iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER in acidic media, and then summarize some typical oxides that possesses good catalytic performance. Besides, we also present the unresolved problems and challenges in an attempt to enhance the activity/stability of these catalysts.</description>

                Abstract To realize the practical application of rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air batteries (ZABs), it is imperative to develop a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst with high electrochemical performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, Ni&#8208;doped Co 9 S 8 nanoparticles dispersed on an inverse opal&#8208;structured N, S co&#8208;doped carbon matrix (IO&#9472;Ni x Co 9&#8208;x S 8 @NSC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst is presented. The unique 3D porous structure, arranged in an inverse opal pattern, provides a large active surface area. Also, the conductive carbon substrate ensures the homogeneous dispersion of Ni x Co 9&#8208;x S 8 nanocrystals, preventing aggregation and increasing the exposure of active sites. The introduction of heteroatom dopants into the Co 9 S 8 structure generates defect sites and enhances surface polarity, thereby improving electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solutions. Consequently, the IO&#9472;Ni x Co 9&#8208;x S 8 @NSC shows excellent bifunctional activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 289 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for OER. Moreover, the rechargeable ZAB assembled with prepared electrocatalyst exhibits a higher specific capacity (768 mAh g Zn &#8722;1 ), peak power density (180.2 mW cm &#8722;2 ), and outstanding stability (over 160 h) compared to precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst.</description>

      <title>Redox-mediated decoupled seawater direct splitting for H2 production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53335-w</link>
      <description>Tao Liu, Cheng Lan, Min Tang, Mengxin Li, Yi-Tao Xu, Huimin Yang, Qingyue Deng, Wenchuan Jiang, Zhiyu Zhao, Yifan Wu, Heping Xie, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403384925

                Abstract Seawater direct electrolysis (SDE) using renewable energy provides a sustainable pathway to harness abundant oceanic hydrogen resources. However, the side-reaction of the chlorine electro-oxidation reaction (ClOR) severely decreased direct electrolysis efficiency of seawater and gradually corrodes the anode. In this study, a redox-mediated strategy is introduced to suppress the ClOR, and a decoupled seawater direct electrolysis (DSDE) system incorporating a separate O 2 evolution reactor is established. Ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN) 6 ] 3&#8722;/4&#8722; ) serves as an electron-mediator between the cell and the reactor, thereby enabling a more dynamically favorable half-reaction to supplant the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This alteration involves a straightforward, single-electron-transfer anodic reaction without gas precipitation and effectively eliminates the generation of chlorine-containing byproducts. By operating at low voltages (~1.37 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and ~1.57 V at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and maintaining stability even in a Cl &#8722; -saturated seawater electrolyte, this system has the potential of undergoing decoupled seawater electrolysis with zero chlorine emissions. Further improvements in the high-performance redox-mediators and catalysts can provide enhanced cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the DSDE system.</description>

      <title>High Coverage Sub&#8208;Nano Iridium Cluster on Core&#8211;Shell Cobalt&#8208;Cerium Bimetallic Oxide for Highly Efficient Full&#8208;pH Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202407475</link>

                Abstract The construction of sub&#8208;nanometer cluster catalysts (&lt;1 nm) with almost complete exposure of active atoms serves as a promising avenue for the simultaneous enhancement of atom utilization efficiency and specific activity. Herein, a core&#8211;shell cobalt&#8208;cerium bimetallic oxide protected by high coverage sub&#8208;nanometer Ir clusters (denoted as Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 ) is constructed by a confined in situ exsolution strategy. The distinctive core&#8211;shell structure endows Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 with enhanced intrinsic activity and high conductivity, facilitating efficient charge transfer and full&#8208;pH water splitting. The Ir cluster@CoO/CeO 2 achieves low overpotentials of 49/215, 52/390, and 54/243 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 , 1.0 m PBS, and 1.0 m KOH, respectively. The small decline in performance after 300 h of operation renders it one of the most effective catalysts for full&#8208;pH water splitting. DFT calculations indicate that oriented electron transfer (along the path from Ce to Co and then to Ir) creates an electron&#8208;rich environment for surface Ir clusters. The reconstructed interface electronic environment provides optimized intermediates adsorption/desorption energy at the Ir site (for HER) and at the Ir&#8208;Co site (for OER), thus simultaneously speeding up the HER/OER kinetics.</description>

      <title>Supersaturated Doping-Induced Maximized Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c09249</link>
      <description>Hanwen Liu, Wenhui Shi, Yaqing Guo, Yunjie Mei, Yi Rao, Jinli Chen, Shiyuan Liu, Cheng Lin, Anmin Nie, Qi Wang, Yifei Yuan, Bao Yu Xia, Yonggang Yao, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403388783

                Metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI) is pivotal and ubiquitously used in the development of next-generation catalysts, offering a pathway to enhance both catalytic activity and stability. However, owing to the lattice mismatch and poor solubility, traditional catalysts often exhibit a metal-on-support heterogeneous structure with limited interfaces and interaction and, consequently, a compromised enhancement of properties. Herein, we report a universal and tunable method for supersaturated doping of transition-metal carbides via strongly nonequilibrium carbothermal shock synthesis, characterized by rapid heating and swift quenching. Our results enable &#8764;20 at. % Ni2FeCo doping in Mo2C, significantly surpassing the thermodynamic equilibrium limit of &lt;3 at. %. The supersaturation ensures more catalytically active NiFeCo doping and sufficient interaction with Mo2C, resulting in the maximized MSI (Max-MSI) effect. The Max-MSI enables outstanding activity and particularly stability in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction, showing an overpotential of 284 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 and stable for 700 h, while individual Ni2FeCo and Mo2C only last less than 70 and 10 h (completely dissolved), respectively. In particular, the SD-Mo2C catalyst also exhibits excellent durability at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for up to 400 h in 7 M KOH. Such a significantly improved stability is attributed to the supersaturated doping that led to each Mo atom strongly binding with adjacent heteroatoms, thus elevating the dissolution potential and corrosion resistance of Mo2C at a high current density. Additionally, the highly dispersed NiFeCo also facilitates the formation of dense oxyhydroxide coating during reconstruction, further protecting the integrated catalysts for durable operation. Furthermore, the synthesis has been successfully scaled up to fabricate large (16 cm2) electrodes and is adaptable to nickel foam substrates, indicating promising industrial applications. Our strategy allows the general and versatile production of various highly doped transition-metal carbides, such as Ni2FeCo-doped TiC, NbC, and W2C, thus unlocking the potential of maximized or adjustable MSI for diverse catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>High&#8208;Entropy Selenides with Tunable Lattice Distortion as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Developing stable and active electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency, which sluggish kinetics hinders sustainable hydrogen production. High entropy selenides (HESes) features with random distribution of multiple metals cations and unique electronic and size effect of Se anion, allowing for precious regulation of their catalytic properties towards high OER activity. In this work, we report a series of high&#8208;entropy selenides catalysts with tunable lattice strain for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. Electrochemical measurements show that the quinary (NiCoMnMoFe)Sex requires only 291 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and exhibits a superior stability with negligible current decay during 100 h&#8217;s continuous operation. By combining experimental measurements and theoretical calculation, the study reveals that the lattice distortion, reflected by the local microstrain near the active site, plays a vital role in boosting the OER activity of HESes.</description>

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is considered an ideal green hydrogen production technology with promising application prospects. However, the development of efficient and stable acid electroanalytic oxygen electrocatalysts is still a challenging bottleneck. This progress is achieved by adopting a strategic approach with the introduction of the high valence metal Ta to regulate the electronic configuration of RuO2 by manipulating its local microenvironment to optimize the stability and activity of the electrocatalysts. The Ta-RuO2 catalysts are notable for their excellent electrocatalytic activity, as evidenced by an overpotential of only 202 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which significantly exceeds that of homemade RuO2 and commercial RuO2. Furthermore, the Ta-RuO2 catalyst exhibits exceptional stability with negligible potential reduction observed after 50 h of electrolysis. Theoretical calculations show that the asymmetric configuration of Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Ta breaks the thermodynamic activity limitations usually associated with adsorption evolution, weakening the energy barrier for the formation of the OOH* formation. The strategic approach presented in this study provides an important reference for the development of a stable active center for acid water splitting.</description>

                Innovative electrode design is critical for improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and meeting rising global energy demands. Despite the development of numerous carbon materials for water splitting, their potential is hampered by sluggish kinetics, primarily due to high activation energy compounded by various smaller factors, including additives or binders used in electrode modification. To address these limitations, a catalyst&#8208;free plastic chip electrode (PCE) for OER is developed. PCE is functionalized by oxidizing it in acidic media at 1.8 V versus Ag/AgCl and eliminates the need for additives, offering a more accurate industrial representation. The oxidation process enhances the electrode's surface area and introduces electrochemically active oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups. Characterization of the modified PCE is conducted using scanning electron microscope, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman, and thermogravimetric analysis, while electrolyte analysis utilizes UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy and NMR. The PCE oxidized for 6 h (PCE@6) demonstrates improved OER performance, with an onset overpotential of 260 mV, an overpotential of 1.06 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and a Tafel slope of 494 mV decade &#8722;1 . The modified PCE reduces overpotential and minimizes bubble formation, enhancing efficiency and showcasing its potential as a cost&#8208;effective solution for alkaline water electrolysis systems.</description>

                A novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst was prepared by a synthesis strategy consisting of the solvothermal growth of Ni3S2 nanostructures on Ni foam, followed by hydrothermal incorporation of Fe species (Fe&#8211;Ni3S2/Ni foam). This electrocatalyst displayed a low OER overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2, a low Tafel slope of 43 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1, and constant performance at an industrially relevant current density (500 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) over 100 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, despite a minor loss of Fe in the process. Based on a detailed characterization by (in situ) Raman spectroscopy, (quasi-in situ) XPS, SEM, TEM, XRD, ICP-AES, EIS, and Cdl analysis, the high OER activity and stability of Fe&#8211;Ni3S2/Ni foam were attributed to the nanostructuring of the surface in the form of stable nanosheets and to the combination of Ni3S2 granting suitable electrical conductivity with newly formed NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides at the surface of the material providing the active sites for OER.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-Deficient Ruthenium Oxide for Selective Oxygen Evolution in Additive-Free Brine Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Here, low-crystalline ruthenium oxide (S-RuO x ) with abundant oxygen vacancies was synthesized, after which its activity and selectivity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in additive-free brine solution were compared with those of commercial ruthenium(IV) dioxide (C-RuO 2 ), a benchmark catalyst for OER in an alkaline electrolyte. S-RuO x delivered a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at a significantly low overpotential (465 mV) in a 0.5 M NaCl solution without requiring an alkali. The estimated Faradaic efficiency toward chloride oxidation reaction (COR), FE(COR), was 2%, and exceptional OER was achieved without generating chlorine oxide species. This sharply contrasts the fact that C-RuO 2 required an overpotential of 525 mV to generate 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , where the FE(COR) was 59%. The activity and selectivity toward OER decreased after reducing the oxygen vacancies by sintering S-RuO x at different temperatures. S-RuO x continued to generate 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 0.5 M NaCl solution for &#8805;60 h while maintaining the increasing potential at &lt;30 mV. However, FE(COR) increased from a few percent for 20h to 34% probably because of an irreversible decrease in vacancies. Notably, the addition of an alkali or a buffer could only enhance OER.</description>

                We found that PhycoErythrin-rich &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt; achieved faster growth rates (&#181;), across the spectral bandwidths from 405 &#8211; 730 nm, under 2.5 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], characteristic of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs), than under 250 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], whereas PhycoCyanin-rich strain showed generally similar &#181; under 2.5 and 250 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. For PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &#181; showed also positive linear responses to both Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, and to cumulative diel PSII electron flux, although the relations vary across strain and [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. Electron transport downstream of Photosystem II was generally higher for both PhycoCyanin- and PhycoErythrin-rich strains under 250 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], since cyanobacteria show strong capacity for electron flow away from PSII to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly under excess excitation. Even though electron transport was faster under 250 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], the PhycoErythrin-rich strain showed a higher growth yield of electron transport under 2.5 &#181;M [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. PhycoErythrin-rich &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt; are currently typically found at greater depths, and lower light, than are PhycoCyanin-rich strains, but we suggest that the PhycoErythrin-rich strains are actually limited to lower light by an interaction between light and full air-saturated [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. In expanding Oxygen Minimum Zones PhycoErythrin-rich strains will likely exploit higher light niches, across a wider spectral range.</description>

                There is a great deal of interest in the development of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that are stable and have high activity because this anodic half-reaction is the main bottleneck in water splitting and other key technologies. Cobalt and iron oxide and oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts constitute a cheaper alternative to the highly active and commonly used Ir- and Ru-based catalysts. Most of the described electrocatalysts require tedious synthetic and expensive preparation procedures. We report here a facile and straightforward preparation of an electrocatalyst by a combination of commercial compounds, such as cobalt chloride and ferrocene. A highly active and stable OER electrocatalyst is obtained, which shows a low overpotential in the alkaline medium as a consequence of a synergistic effect between both compounds and is inexpensive.</description>

                Abstract Photothermocatalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) offers a promising strategy for converting solar energy into fuel. However, the high light intensity required for high fuel production rates and thermodynamically more favorable coking side reactions limit this strategy. Herein, a nanocomposite of La&#8208;doped Al 2 O 3 supporting Ru nanoparticles (NPs) (Ru/La&#8208;Al 2 O 3 ) is synthesized. At relatively low light intensity (80.2 kW m &#8722;2 ), Ru/La&#8208;Al 2 O 3 obtains high production rates of CO and H 2 per gram of Ru ( r Ru, CO and r Ru, H2 , 8410.19 and 7181.94 mmol g Ru &#8722;1 min &#8722;1 ) with light&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency ( &#951; , 26.6%), and completely prohibits coking. In striking contrast, the reference catalyst without La doping (Ru/Al 2 O 3 ) exhibits lower r Ru, CO , r Ru, H2 , &#951; and produces large amounts of coke. The improved photothermocatalytic performance stems from the fact that reactive oxygen species and carbonate species are involved in the oxidation of carbon species (rate&#8208;determining steps of DRM) through two different reaction pathways, which significantly increases catalytic activity and prevents the carbon species from polymerizing into coke. Additionally, light not only enhances the DRM on Ru NPs and the oxidation reaction between carbonate species and carbon species but also promotes the dissociation of CH 4 and desorption of H 2 , which improves the catalytic activity and product selectivity of Ru/La&#8208;Al 2 O 3 .</description>

                Realizing efficient and durable non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a great challenge. Here, a multi&#8208;component composite of Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC containing pyrophosphate, nitride, and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is successfully prepared via a facile two&#8208;step synthesis method. Combining the structural regulation between the active metal&#8208; and non&#8208;metal&#8208;based species, Co2P2O7&#8208;MoN/NC demonstrates superior activity and durability for OER, requiring an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 83.3 mV dec&#8722;1, and long&#8208;term stability over 100 h in an alkaline solution. Post&#8208;characterizations reveal that synergistic effect among stable Co2P2O7, partially dissolved MoN, N&#8208;doped carbon, and new&#8208;formed CoOOH nanosheets enable structural reconstruction, fast charge transfer, and formation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, promoting the OER performance significantly. This work provides a promising pathway to tune multi&#8208;components to fabricate efficient transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in energy conversion applications.</description>

                Enhancing the efficiencies of electrochemical reactions for converting renewable energy into clean chemical fuels as well as generating clean energy is critical to achieving carbon neutrality. However, this enhancement can be achieved using materials that are not constrained by resource limitations and those that can be converted into devices in a scalable manner, preferably for industrial applications. This review explores the applications of electrochemically deposited manganese dioxides (MnO2) and their composites as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions for converting renewable energy into chemical fuels. It also explores their applications as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and bifunctional OER/ORR for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries, respectively. Manganese is the second most abundant transition metal in the Earth&#8217;s crust, and electrodeposition represents a binder&#8208;free and scalable technique for fabricating devices (electrodes). To propose an improved catalyst design, the studies on the electrodeposition mechanism of MnO2 as well as the fabrication techniques for MnO2&#8208;based nanocomposites accumulated in the development of electrodes for supercapacitors are also included in this review.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202415423</link>

                In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valent metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.</description>

                We investigated the composition-activity relationship of porous FeNi alloy foams for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We compared conventional transient behavior using cyclic voltammetry with the performance at high geometric current densities up to 3.0 A cm-2 achieved at quasi steady-state conditions employing pulsed electrolysis. The experiments were performed under setup parameters, we introduce as dry anode conditions for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers. In this context, a dry anode refers to an electrode setup in which the catalyst is not directly submerged in a liquid medium, unlike conventional electrodes fed with an alkaline electrolyte. Instead, the anode is purged with humidified gas. Eleven different compositions in the FeNi alloy space (93 &#8211; 2 at. % Fe) were synthesized using the hydrogen bubble template method, resulting in porous foams with similar structures. A rigorous statistical analysis of all measured data was conducted to ensure reproducibility. The influence of bubble formation on the solution resistance is elucidated and, consequently, the apparent performance is assessed. The most efficient alloy composition required an averaged mean potential of 1.82 VRHE for 3 A cm-2 under quasi steady-state conditions.</description>

                The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8208; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#183;H2O (Ni&#8208;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8208; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8208;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.</description>

      <title>Fleeting-Active-Site-Thrust Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Iron Cations from the Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09585</link>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key to sustainable energy and environmental engineering, thus necessitating rational design of high-performing electrocatalysts that requires understanding the structure-performance relationship with a possible dynamic nature under working conditions. Herein, we uncover a novel type of OER mechanisms thrust by the fleeting active sites (FASs) dynamically formed on Ni-based layered double hydroxides (Ni-LDHs) by Fe cations from the electrolyte under OER potentials. We employ grand-canonical ensemble methods and microkinetic modeling to elucidate the potential-dependent structures of FASs on Ni-LDHs and demonstrate that the fleeting-active-site-thrust (FAST) mechanism delivers superior OER activity via the FAST intramolecular oxygen coupling pathway, which also suppresses the lattice oxygen mechanism, leading to improved operando stability of Ni-LDHs. We further reveal that introducing only trace-level loadings (10-100 ppm) of FASs on Ni-LDHs can significantly boost and govern the catalytic performance for OER. This underscores the crucial importance of considering the novel FAST mechanism in OER and also suggests the electrolyte as a key part of the structure-performance relationship as well as an effective design strategy via engineering the electrolyte.</description>

      <title>Computational Fluid Dynamics Modelling of Hydrogen Production via Water Splitting in Oxygen Membrane Reactors</title>

      <description>Kai Bittner, Nikolaos Margaritis, Falk Schulze&#8208;K&#252;ppers, J. Wolters, Ghaleb Natour, Membranes. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403478574

                The utilization of oxygen transport membranes enables the production of high-purity hydrogen by the thermal decomposition of water below 1000 &#176;C. This process is based on a chemical potential gradient across the membrane, which is usually achieved by introducing a reducing gas. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to model reactors based on this concept. In this study, a modelling approach for water splitting is presented in which oxygen transport through the membrane acts as the rate-determining process for the overall reaction. This transport step is implemented in the CFD simulation. Both gas compartments are modelled in the simulations. Hydrogen and methane are used as reducing gases. The model is validated using experimental data from the literature and compared with a simplified perfect mixing modelling approach. Although the main focus of this work is to propose an approach to implement the water splitting in CFD simulations, a simulation study was conducted to exemplify how CFD modelling can be utilized in design optimization. Simplified 2-dimensional and rotational symmetric reactor geometries were compared. This study shows that a parallel overflow of the membrane in an elongated reactor is advantageous, as this reduces the back diffusion of the reaction products, which increases the mean driving force for oxygen transport through the membrane.</description>

                The catalysts were always undergoing continuous amorphization and dissolution of active structure in operating condition, hindering the compatibility between stability and activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we propose the selective adsorption of leached NO3&#8208; to strengthen the crystallinity and activity of surface reconstructed layer with amorphous and crystalline (a&#8208;c) heterojunction. Taking a&#8208;c Ni doped Fe2O(OH)3NO3&#183;H2O (Ni&#8208;FeNH) as a model precatalyst, we uncover that the leached NO3&#8208; are readily adsorbs on the crystalline phase in the formed a&#8208;c Fe(Ni)OOH during OER, lowering the disorder degree and further activating Ni and Fe ion of the crystalline Fe(Ni)OOH on a&#8208;c heterojunctions. Accordingly, Ni&#8208;FeNH deliver a low overpotential of 303 mV and high durability of 500 hours at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for OER. Particularly, constructing industrial water electrolysis equipment exhibits high stability of 100 hours under a high operating current of 8000 mA.</description>

      <title>A Straightforward Model for Quantifying Local pH Gradients Governing the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09521</link>
      <description>Samuel S. Veroneau, Alaina C. Hartnett, Jaeyune Ryu, Hyukhun Hong, Cyrille Costentin, Daniel G. Nocera, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403326469

                The production and consumption of protons by an electrocatalyst will, under certain conditions, generate localized microenvironments with properties distinct from those of the bulk solution. These local properties are particularly impactful for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer, where the generation of locally basic or acidic environments may significantly influence the energy efficiency and reaction selectivity of the electrocatalyst. Whereas local pH environments have been observed and characterized in reductive half-reactions, including the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, the incompatibility of conventional techniques and materials has limited studies in oxidative half-reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which provides the reducing equivalents for solar-to-fuels electrolysis. With the straightforward parameters bulk pH, buffer composition and pKa, and mass transport, we develop a model for describing local pH as a function of current density regardless of the microscopic details of the mechanism. Using an acid-stable PbOx OER catalyst, we observe the formation and dissipation of pH gradients during the OER and validate the model with voltammetric and potentiometric studies. The model predicts how local acidic environments can develop over a narrow OER current density window, thus providing further motivation for the development of OER catalysts that are stable to acid, even when operating in basic aqueous conditions. More generally, the model is not restricted to the OER and is useful for determining the onset of local pH gradients for other electrocatalytic reactions that involve the consumption or generation of protons in energy conversion reactions.</description>

      <title>The breakthrough of oxide pathway mechanism in stability and scaling relationship for water oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae362</link>
      <description>Zhaohua Yin, &#1041;&#1086; &#1051;&#1102;, Jin&#8208;Song Hu, Jianjun Wang, National Science Review. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403409683

                Abstract An in-depth understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms is essential for advancing electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The emerging oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) streamlines direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, circumventing the formation of oxygen vacancy defects characteristic of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and bypassing additional reaction intermediates (*OOH) inherent to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). With only *O and *OH as intermediates, OPM-driven electrocatalysts stand out for their ability to disrupt traditional scaling relationships while ensuring stability. This review compiles the latest significant advances in OPM-based electrocatalysis, detailing design principles, synthetic methods, and sophisticated techniques to identify active sites and pathways.

                The addition of Mn into a CeO2-based catalyst has been proven to promote C2 products at low temperature OCM reactions. However, the addition of Mn results in additional lattice oxygen, which contributes to CO2 production. The addition of another metal is expected to increase the amount of surface electrophilic oxygen by changing the lattice oxygen reactivity of the 33 wt% of manganese/CeO2 (33Mn/Ce) catalyst, resulting in improved oxygen evolution via active metal addition. A series of 33MnX/Ce catalysts with various X metals were developed. The 33 wt% of manganese and 15 wt% of calcium over CeO2 catalyst (33Mn15Ca/Ce) has the highest catalytic activity at 450 oC. The catalysts were evaluated using XRD, Raman, N2 adsorption-desorption, and XPS analysis, which revealed that the addition of Ca promotes the formation of Mn3+ cation. However, the number of oxygen vacancies has decreased, but the amount of surface electrophilic oxygen has increased. 33Mn15Ca/Ce catalyst performs better in oxygen-rich conditions and has a longer contact time.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Plasma Triggered Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe Motif in Prussian Blue Analogue for Efficient and Robust Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202415423</link>
      <description>Hao Xu, Chen Zhu, Hao Lin, Ji Kai Liu, Yi Xiao Wu, Huai Qin Fu, Xinyu Zhang, Fangxin Mao, Hai Yang Yuan, Chenghua Sun, Peng Fei Liu, Hua Gui Yang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403463126

                In the context of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the construction of high&#8208;valent transition metal sites to trigger the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is considered crucial for overcoming the performance limitations of traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. However, the dynamic evolution of lattice oxygen during the reaction poses significant challenges for the stability of high&#8208;valent metal sites, particularly in high&#8208;current&#8208;density water&#8208;splitting systems. Here, we have successfully constructed Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe catalytic active motifs in cobalt&#8208;iron Prussian blue analogs (CoFe&#8208;PBA) through oxygen plasma bombardment, effectively activating lattice oxygen reactivity while sustaining robust stability. Our spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that the Co&#8208;O&#8208;Fe bridged motifs enable a unique double&#8208;exchange interaction between Co and Fe atoms, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valent Co species as OER active centers while maintaining Fe in a low&#8208;valent state, preventing its dissolution. The resultant catalyst (CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30) requires an overpotential of only 276 mV to achieve 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline exchange membrane electrolyzer using CoFe&#8208;PBA&#8208;30 as anode material achieves a high current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 1.76 V and continuously operates for 250 hours with negligible degradation. This work provides significant insights for activating lattice oxygen redox without compromising structure stability in practical water electrolyzers.</description>

                ABSTRACT In this study, the electrochemical behaviour of phosphine in sulphuric acid solutions on the surface of various electrode materials was conducted by voltammetric investigations. The effects of electrode materials such as lead, copper, and platinum electrodes on the PH 3 anodic oxidation were investigated. Polarization curves were recorded by saturating the sulphuric acid solution with phosphine. The results received show that the electrochemical oxidation of phosphine on the lead electrode is accompanied by an oxygen evolution potential and, on the copper electrode, copper (II) ions show catalytic effects. The maximum anodic oxidation of phosphine on a platinum electrode was observed at the potential range of 0.8&#8211;1.0 V, and in the presence of copper (II) ions on the polarogram a maximum of phosphine oxidation is recorded at a potential of approximately 0.1&#8211;0.2 V.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Heterointerfaces of Earth-Abundant Transition-Metal Nanoclusters on Nickel Oxide Nanosheets for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting through Electronic Structure Optimization</title>

                Evolving highly competent and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis is crucial in renewable hydrogen energy technologies. The slow hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics under alkaline electrolytes, still, has troubled developments in high-performance green hydrogen production systems. Herein, we demonstrate the tailoring of the interface of earth-abundant transition-metal nanoclusters (MNCs), including iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu) nanoclusters on nickel oxide nanosheets (M NCs|NiO NS) through metal-support interaction for enriched overall water splitting under an alkaline electrolyte. The strong metal-metal oxide interaction allows alteration of the binding capabilities of hydrogen ions (*H) and hydroxyl ions (*OH) on Ni electrodes. Specifically, the robust interaction between Fe and NiO reveals optimized binding of H* and OH* energies, facilitating the water-splitting reaction under an alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the improved HER/OER catalytic activity is attained with the Fe NCs|NiO NS with small overpotentials of &#8764;62.0 and &#8764;380.0 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, a high mass activity of &#8764;90.0 A g</description>

      <title>Interface Synergistic Effect of NiFe-LDH/3D GA Composites on Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14201661</link>
      <description>Jiangcheng Zhang, Qiuhan Cao, Xin Yu, Yao Hu, Bao&#8208;Lian Su, Xiaohui Guo, Nanomaterials. 14(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403457301

                Currently, NiFe-LDH exhibits an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the interaction of the two metal elements on the layered double hydroxide (LDH) platform. However, such interaction is still insufficient to compensate for its poor electrical conductivity, limited number of active sites and sluggish dynamics. Herein, a feasible two-step hydrothermal strategy that involves coupling low-conductivity NiFe-LDH with 3D porous graphene aerogel (GA) is proposed. The optimized NiFe-LDH/GA (1:1) produced possesses a 257 mV (10 mA cm&#8722;2) overpotential and could operate stably for 56 h in an OER. Our investigation demonstrates that the NiFe-LDH/GA has a three-dimensional mesoporous structure, and that there is synergistic interaction between LDH and GA and interfacial reconstruction of NiOOH. Such an interface synergistic coupling effect promotes fast mass transfer and facilitates OER kinetics, and this work offers new insights into designing efficient and stable GA-based electrocatalysts.</description>

                Developing an OER electrocatalyst that balances high performance with low cost is crucial for widely adopting PEM water electrolyzers. Ru-based catalysts are gaining attention for their cost-effectiveness and high activity, positioning them as promising alternatives to Ir-based catalysts. However, Ru-based catalysts can be prone to oxidation at high potentials, compromising their durability. In this study, we utilize a simple synthesis method to synthesize a SnO2, Nb2O5, and RuO2 composite catalyst (SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2) with multiple interfaces and abundant oxygen vacancies. The large surface area and numerous active sites of the SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 catalyst lead to outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, achieving current densities of 10, 50, and 200 mA cm&#8722;2 at ultralow overpotentials of 287, 359, and 534 mV, respectively, significantly surpassing commercial IrO2. Moreover, incorporating Nb2O5 into the SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 alters the electronic structure at the interfaces and generates a high density of oxygen vacancies, markedly enhancing durability. Consequently, the membrane electrode composed of SnO2/Nb2O5@RuO2 and commercial Pt/C demonstrated stable operation in the PEM cell for 25 days at an industrial current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2. This research presents a convenient approach for developing a highly efficient and durable Ru-based electrocatalyst, underscoring its potential for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract FeNiOOH is regarded as the most stable active species in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the high oxidation energy of NiOOH poses a challenge to directly synthesize FeNiOOH as a real OER catalyst. Herein, an anion&#8208;mediated kinetically controlled strategy is proposed, coupled with cation&#8208;induced geometric topology modulation, to directly synthesis FeNiOOH with ultra&#8208;thin, densely packed nanosheet architectures. Specifically, the Cl &#8722; &#8208;mediated in situ generation of hypochlorous acid promotes the direct formation of NiFeOOH. Concurrently, high&#8208;valence competitive Ru 3+ mitigate electrostatic repulsion, fostering a compact and densely packed assembly of Ru/FeNiOOH nanosheet branches. Furthermore, the intrinsic electron&#8208;capturing ability of FeOOH, in synergy with the stabilizing effect of doped Ru atoms, further promote the formation and stabilization high&#8208;valence NiOOH. Consequently, the hierarchical Ru/FeNiOOH@NiPO x nanoarray catalyst displays exceptional OER performance, with an overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and outstanding stability. This study provides a novel strategy to directly construct a real catalyst.</description>

                Abstract Additive manufacturing of transition metal sulfides (TMS) enables the creation of complex 3D structures, significantly expanding their applications. However, preparing 3D&#8208;structured TMS remains challenging due to difficulties in developing suitable inks. In this study, a supramolecular micelle hydrogel as the ink to fabricate 3D&#8208;structured TMS is utilized. Initially, the hydrogels are printed and infused with metal salt solutions to stabilize the structures, which are then calcined to convert into miniaturized 3D&#8208;TMS replicas. The micellar hydrogels crosslink via hydrophobic interactions, with sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) micelles providing both a hydrophobic environment and sulfur sources. During calcination, the decomposed sulfur precursors coordinate with metal ions to form various TMS, including FeS 2 , Cu 2 S, Ni 3 S 2 , and Co 9 S 8 , along with several metal sulfides like PbS and SnS. Additionally, the method also allows for the preparation of transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoS 2 and WS 2 . The formation mechanism is demonstrated using Ni 3 S 2 as an example which exhibits notable catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Given its simplicity and versatility, this dynamic micellar hydrogel&#8208;derived strategy offers a promising pathway for creating advanced TMS materials.</description>

                This research work reports the synthesis of copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles supported on activated carbon by a simple impregnation method using 2-propanol as a green solvent, followed by calcination. The synthesized CuO@C is used as an efficient heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the synthesis of 2H-indazoles and quinazolines utilizing commercially available 2-bromobenzaldehydes, primary amines, and sodium azide under ligand-free and base-free conditions. The present methodology demonstrates the formation of new N&#8211;N, C&#8211;N, and C&#9552;N bonds under one-pot reaction conditions using PEG-400 as a green solvent. The reaction pathways are supported by control experiments and mechanistic elucidation. Further, the synthesized catalyst was characterized by a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as powdered X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, UV&#8211;vis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and BET-BJH analysis. Importantly, the study focused on the recyclability of the catalyst and successfully showed gram-scale production. Significantly, our active catalyst exhibited an outstanding performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, with an overpotential of 290 mV and a swallow Tafel slope of 91 mV dec&#8211;1.</description>

      <title>Enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity following electrochemical pre-cathodic treatment of Mn-substituted nickel ferrite</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0230619</link>
      <description>Anchal Kishore Singh, Naresh Kumar, Applied Physics Letters. 125(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403406326

                In this study, the electronic engineering of a high-valent active site for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was achieved through the electrochemical pre-cathodic treatment method (EPCTM). This method involves applying a cathodic potential to the drop-cast working electrode of Mn-substituted nickel ferrite (Ni1&#8722;xMnxFe2O4; where x = 0.0, 0.2, and 0.4) electrocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed an increase in the ratios of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ in Ni1&#8722;xMnxFe2O4 after EPCTM followed by OER, leading to an enhancement in electrochemical OER current density at 600 mV overpotential by 3.65 times for x = 0.0, 5.56 times for x = 0.20, and 4.72 times for x = 0.40. This enhancement was further supported by a decrease in the slope of the anodic Tafel equation after EPCTM, indicating improved efficiency of the interaction between the working electrode and electrolyte, as a lower Tafel slope suggests better charge exchange at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. The positive slope in the Mott&#8211;Schottky (MS) plot for all Ni1&#8722;xMnxFe2O4 samples confirmed the p-type nature of the electrocatalysts. Additionally, the significant decrease in the slope of the linear portion of the MS plot indicated an increase in carrier concentration after electrochemical pre-cathodic treatment in all Ni1&#8722;xMnxFe2O4 samples. This increase in p-type carrier concentration supports the observed increase in the Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio for OER after EPCTM.</description>

      <title>Application of a Temporal Multiscale Method for Efficient Simulation of
  Degradation in PEM Water Electrolysis under Dynamic Operation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.06863</link>
      <description>Dayron Chang Dominguez, An Phuc Dam, Thomas Richter, Kai Sundmacher, Shaun M Alia, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403345519

                Hydrogen is vital for sectors like chemicals and others, driven by the need to reduce carbon emissions. Proton Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) is a key technology for the production of green hydrogen under fluctuating conditions of renewable power sources. However, due to the scarcity of noble metal materials, the stability of the anode catalyst layer under dynamic operating conditions must be better understood. Model-aided investigation approaches are essential due to the back-box nature of the electrochemical system and the high costs of experimental long-term testing. In this work, a temporal multiscale method based on a Heterogeneous technique is applied to reduce the computational effort of simulating long-term degradation, focused on catalyst dissolution. Such an approach characterizes the problem in fast locally periodic processes, influenced by the dynamic operation and slow processes attributed to the gradual degradation of the catalyst layer. A mechanistic model that includes the oxygen evolution reaction, catalyst dissolution and hydrogen permeation from the cathode to the anode side is hypothesized and implemented. The multiscale approach notably reduces computational effort of simulation from hours to mere minutes. This efficiency gain is ascribed to the limited evolution of Slow-Scale variables during each period of time of the Fast-Scale variables. Consequently, simulation of the fast processes is required only until local periodicity is achieved within each Slow-Scale time step. Thus, the developed temporal multiscale approach proves to be highly effective in accelerating parameter estimation and predictive simulation steps, as could be verified through the results of this article. In this way, the method can support systematic model development to describe degradation in PEMWE under dynamic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Room-Temperature Synthesis of Phosphate-Intercalated NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides for High-Performance Alkaline Seawater Oxidation</title>

                Quick and easy synthetic methods and highly efficient catalytic performance are equally important to anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for alkaline seawater electrolysis. Herein, we report a facile one-step route to in situ growing PO43&#8211; intercalated NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) on Ni foam (denoted as NiFe-P/NF) by a room-temperature immersion for several minutes. This ultrafast approach transforms the NF surface into a rough PO43&#8211; intercalated NiFe-LDH overlayer, which demonstrates outstanding OER performance in both alkaline simulated and natural seawaters owing to good hydrophilic interface and the electrostatic repulsion of PO43&#8211; against Cl&#8211; anions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the intercalated PO43&#8211; can not only promote electron transfer but also prevent Cl&#8211; from entering the interlayer and simultaneously inhibit the migration of Cl&#8211; over the NiFe-LDH surface. In alkaline simulated and natural seawater electrolytes, NiFe-P/NF needs low overpotentials of 248 and 298 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. NiFe-P/NF can stably run over 42 h in an alkaline high-salty electrolyte (1 M KOH + 2.5 M NaCl) at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, more than 70 times that of NiFe/NF (0.6 h), emphasizing the critical role of the intercalated PO43&#8211; anions on the excellent durability. This study offers a new strategy to modify commercial NF to prepare efficient and stable OER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract Electronic structure regulation is a prevailing approach to modifying the electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet its impact on the co&#8208;catalysts modified photoanodes remains uncertain. Herein, B&#8208;modified NiFe&#8208;LDH (NiFeB&#8208;hydx) co&#8208;catalyst in situ is immobilized onto Ti&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 and emphasizes the effect of lower&#8208;valence Ni (Ni 2&#8208;&#948; ) in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) process. A flexible adjustment in the oxidation state of Ni from +2 to 0 by manipulating the Ni content and the corresponding B quantity is achieved. Interestingly, the Ni 0 significantly reduces the onset potential low to 0.53 V RHE , albeit leading to wasted holes due to incomplete redox transition. An optimal amount of Ni 2&#8208;&#948; effectively facilitates the redox transition of Ni and achieves a delicate balance between hole extraction and consumption, substantially enhancing the PEC performance. Density functional theory calculations verifies the electron enrichment of Ni and the corresponding benefits for enhancing OER. Furthermore, introducing FeOOH as a hole transfer layer on Ti&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 induces a pronounced band bending effect, remarkably promoting the meticulously engineered NiFeB&#8208;hydx/FeOOH/Ti&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 photoanode to a photocurrent density of 3.29 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V RHE . NiFeB&#8208;hydx/FeOOH can be universally applied to the BiVO 4 photoanode, resulting in doubled photocurrent density (4.8 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V RHE ).</description>

      <title>Widespread adaptive evolution in angiosperm photosystems provides insight into the evolution of photosystem II repair</title>

                Abstract Oxygenic photosynthesis generates the initial energy source that fuels nearly all life on Earth. At the heart of the process are the photosystems, which are pigment binding multi-protein complexes that catalyse the first step of photochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Here, we investigate the molecular evolution of the plastid-encoded photosystem subunits at single-residue resolution across 773 angiosperm species. We show that despite an extremely high level of conservation, 7% of residues in the photosystems, spanning all photosystem subunits, exhibit hallmarks of adaptive evolution. Through in silico modelling of these adaptive substitutions, we uncover the impact of these changes on the predicted properties of the photosystems, focussing on their effects on co-factor binding and inter-subunit interface formation. By analyzing these cohorts of changes, we reveal that evolution has repeatedly altered the interaction between photosystem II and its D1 subunit in a manner that is predicted to reduce the energetic barrier for D1 turnover and photosystem repair. Together, these results provide insight into the trajectory of photosystem adaptation during angiosperm evolution.</description>

      <title>Oxygen chemoreceptor inhibition by dopamine D2 receptors in isolated zebrafish gills</title>

                Dopamine is an essential modulator of oxygen sensing and control of ventilation and was the first neurotransmitter described in the carotid body. Little is known of the evolutionary significance of dopamine in oxygen sensing, or whether it plays a similar role in anamniotes. In the model vertebrate, zebrafish (Danio rerio), presynaptic dopamine D2 receptor expression was demonstrated in gill neuroepithelial cells (NECs)-analogues of mammalian oxygen chemoreceptors; however, a mechanism for dopamine and D2 in oxygen sensing in the gills had not been defined. The present study tested the hypothesis that presynaptic D2 receptors provide a feedback mechanism that attenuates the chemoreceptor response to hypoxia. Using an isolated gill preparation from Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) zebrafish, we measured hypoxia-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in NECs and postsynaptic neurons. Activation of D2 with dopamine or specific D2 agonist, quinpirole, decreased hypoxic responses in NECs; whereas D2 antagonist, domperidone, had the opposite effect. Addition of SQ22536, an adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhibitor, decreased the effect of hypoxia on [Ca2+]i, similar to dopamine. Activation of AC by forskolin partially recovered the suppressive effect of dopamine on the Ca2+ response to hypoxia. Further, we demonstrate that the response to hypoxia in postsynaptic sensory neurons was dependent upon innervation with NECs, and was subject to modulation by activation of presynaptic D2. Our results provide the first evidence of neurotransmission of the hypoxic signal at the NEC-nerve synapse in the gill and suggest that a presynaptic, modulatory role for dopamine in oxygen sensing arose early in vertebrate evolution.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Activity and Stability in AgCl&#8208;CuO Electrocatalysts: Insights from Different Morphologies for Enhanced ORR Performance</title>

                Highly enduring and methanol&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts are pertinent to revolutionizing direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) technologies. Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts are anticipated to rank among the remarkable electrocatalysts for boosting the sluggish Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) kinetics. Herein, we report a facile approach to optimize the activity and stability of the AgCl&#8208;CuO systems. The tailored Nano Particle&#8208;Nano Rod (NP&#8208;NR) and Nano Leaf (NL) like morphologies deliver remarkable bifunctional catalytic performance for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, sustained activity, and comparatively better stability for ORR. A meager shift of only 0.014 V and 0.024 V in the half&#8208;wave potential is observed in the NP&#8208;NR and NL structures, respectively, for the ORR even after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, both the AgCl&#8208;CuO composite exhibits an excellent tolerance to methanol.</description>

      <title>3-Electrode Setup for the Operando Detection of Side Reactions in Li-Ion Batteries: The Quantification of Released Lattice Oxygen and Transition Metal Ions from NCA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad8038</link>
      <description>Lennart Reuter, Leonhard Reinschl&#252;ssel, Hubert A. Gasteiger, Journal of The Electrochemical Society. 171(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403503541

                Detecting parasitic side reactions is paramount for developing stable cathode active materials (CAMs) for Li-ion batteries. This study presents a method for the quantification of released lattice oxygen and transition metal ions (TM II+ ions). It is based on a 3-electrode cell design employing a Vulcan carbon-based sense electrode (SE) that is held at a controlled voltage against a partially delithiated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) counter electrode (CE). At this SE, reductive currents can be measured while polarizing a CAM working electrode (WE), here a LiNi 0.80 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2 (NCA), against the same LFP CE. In voltammetric scans, we show how the SE potential can be selected to specifically detect a given side reaction during CAM charge/discharge, allowing, e.g., to discriminate between lattice oxygen and dissolved TMs. Furthermore, it is shown via online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OEMS) that O 2 reduction in the here-used LP47 electrolyte consumes &#8764;2.3 electrons/O 2 . Using this value, the lattice oxygen release deduced from the 3-electrode setup upon charging of the NCA WE is in good agreement with OEMS measurements up to NCA potentials &gt;4.65 V Li . At higher potentials, the contributions from the reduction of TM II+ ions can be quantified by comparing the integrated SE current with the O 2 evolution from OEMS.</description>

      <title>Nanobubble Formation and Coverage during High Current Density Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>

                Gas bubbles are a necessary byproduct of water electrolysis whereby hydrogen and oxygen are produced from water. These attached gases reduce the electrode's active area, which necessitates a deep understanding of the bubble life cycle starting from nanobubbles. Synchronized with the electrochemistry, the time evolution of the surface nanobubble size and coverage is resolved using grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and correlated with optical microscopy and theoretical calculations to show that a significant portion of the surface is covered in nanobubbles after larger micron-sized bubbles are observed. These nanobubbles increase in number and decrease in size, toward 2 nm diameter, with the charge passed. The trend in size and number is consistent with an increase in supersaturation, which reduces the nascent bubble size. Altogether, this study suggests a significant portion of the surface contains nanobubbles and that strategies to reduce the dissolved hydrogen would be effective at reducing the nanobubble surface coverage.</description>

                Abstract Urea, a highly sought&#8208;after fertilizer, is conventionally manufactured through the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process but is frequently encountered as a pollutant in wastewater. Thus, achieving sustainable urea production under ambient conditions and the potential to recycle urea from wastewater represent significant eco&#8208;economic advancements. In this study, a novel Ni&#8208;confined In 2 O 3 (Ni&#8208;In 2 O 3 ) electrocatalyst demonstrating outstanding capabilities in both the urea evolution reaction (UER) from nitrate and carbon dioxide and the highly efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for waste urea utilization is introduced. Computational data and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis demonstrate that the unique Ni&#8208;oxygen vacancy (Ni&#8208;Vo) local structure effectively modulates the electronic configuration of neighboring In and Ni atoms. This structural refinement results in a significantly reduced energy barrier for the potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS) in both UER (*COOHNH 2 &#8594; *CONH 2 ) and UOR (*CO(NH 2 ) 2 &#8594; *CONHNH 2 ). Consequently, the optimized catalysts achieve a urea evolution faradic efficiency of 19.6%, accompanied by remarkable UOR performance, attaining a 100 mA cm &#8722;2 anodic current density at a potential of 1.35 V. This work not only offers a sustainable route to urea production but also highlights the potential for efficient urea oxidation, contributing to a greener and more economically viable future for the nitrogen cycle.</description>

      <title>Factors influencing osteoradionecrosis progression during hyperbaric oxygen therapy: A case study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.155112.1</link>
      <description>Sameh Mezri, Chaima Zitouni, Khadija Bahrini, Mounir Haggui, Wiem Boughzala, H&#233;di Gharsallah, F1000Research. 13(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403393680

                Introduction Although relatively uncommon, osteoradionecrosis (ORN) remains a serious complication following radiotherapy. Various therapeutic approaches, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), are utilized in managing ORN. This study aims to evaluate the role of HBOT in ORN management and to identify predictive factors influencing the evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT. Methods This retrospective study includes 46 patients who received HBOT for head and neck ORN between 2017 and 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=36) included those with regression or stabilization of ORN, while Group 2 (n=10) comprised patients with worsening lesions. We performed a statistical study in order to identify factors influencing ORN progression under treatment. Results ORN affected the mandible in 93.5% of patients, the maxilla in 2 cases, and the skull base in 4 cases. All patients received HBOT, with an average of 44.65 sessions. Pre-operative HBOT was administered in 17% of cases, and post-operative HBOT was given in 42% of cases. After at least 20 sessions, ORN regressed in 33% of cases, stabilized in 45%, and worsened in 22%. Analysis of factors influencing ORN progression on the univariate study revealed significant associations with high blood pressure (p=0.046), larger tumor size (p=0.004), advanced tumor stages (p=0.048), mean radiation dose (p=0.002), delays between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.045), and the location of ORN within the mandible (p=0.049). Additionally, the number of HBOT sessions significantly affected ORN evolution, with more sessions correlating with better outcomes (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, variables such as the average interval between dental care and radiotherapy (p=0.043) as well as the number of HBOT sessions (p=0.040) emerged as significant influencers of ORN evolution. Conclusion Our study provides valuable insights into the management of ORN by identifying key predictors that influence the post-therapeutic evolution of head and neck ORN after HBOT.</description>

      <title>Catalase regulation during plant&#8208;virus&#8208;vector interaction</title>

                Key message Plant&#8208;virus&#8208;host interaction is a complex process involving several players. A constant arms race between the hosts and viruses has led to their co&#8208;evolution. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signaling molecules that regulate plant growth, development, and stress responses. Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) has a wide host range and infects several plant species such as barley, rice, oats, wheat, etc. A recent study by Tian et al. (2024) has highlighted that the movement protein (MP) of BYDV is involved in manipulation of the host ROS pathway to promote viral multiplication as well as transmission. The findings display the multifaceted role of a viral protein that is otherwise involved in movement. The limited coding ability of viruses is compensated by their proteins having multiple roles in the modulation of several different host molecular pathways. This is one of the key reasons for viruses being successful pathogens despite their limited coding ability.</description>

      <title>Evolution of gas envelopes and outgassed atmospheres of rocky planets that formed via pebble accretion</title>

      <description>Piia Maria Tomberg, Anders Johansen, Astronomy and Astrophysics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403329026

                In this work, we present results of numerical simulations of the formation and early evolution of rocky planets through pebble accretion, with an emphasis on hydrogen envelope longevity and the composition of the outgassed atmosphere. We modelled planets with a range in mass from 0.1 to 5 Earth masses that orbit between 0.7 and 1.7 AU. The composition of the outgassed atmosphere was calculated with the partial pressure of free oxygen fit to geophysical models of magma ocean self-oxidation. The combined X-ray and UV (XUV) radiation-powered photoevaporation is considered as the main driver of atmospheric escape. We modelled planets that remain below the pebble isolation mass and hence accrete tenuous envelopes only. We considered slow, medium, or fast initial stellar rotation for the temporal evolution of the XUV flux. The loss of the envelope is a key event that allows the magma ocean to crystallise and outgas its bulk volatiles. The atmospheric composition of the majority of our simulated planets is dominated by CO$_2$. Our planets accrete a total of 11.6 Earth oceans of water, the majority of which enters the core. The hydrospheres of planets lighter than the Earth reach several times the mass of the Earth's modern oceans, while the hydrospheres of planets ranging from 1 to 3.5 Earth masses are comparable to those of our planet. However, planets of 4-5 Earth masses have smaller hydrospheres due to the trapping of volatiles in their massive mantles. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that hydrogen envelopes are easily lost from rocky planets and that this envelope loss triggers the most primordial partitioning of volatiles between the solid mantle and the atmosphere.</description>

                In the early 1960s, I was working as a traditional chemical engineer studying inanimate objects without the slightest clue of the biological world. At that time, I met Dr Melvin H. Knisely and he encouraged me to use my engineering skills to improve on the Krogh capillary tissue cylinder. I derived a detailed mathematical model and performed a complex computer simulation to achieve that goal. We attended professional meetings on oxygen transport to tissue all over the world, but mainly in Europe, presenting case studies. It became my goal to honour Dr Knisely with a meeting on oxygen transport to tissue at Clemson University in South Carolina, USA. Melvin's wife, Verona, convinced me to also have the meeting at the Medical University of South Carolina located in Charleston, since it was meant to honour Dr Knisely's work with his quartz rod crystal for illumination. He is credited as the first human being to observe the particulate matter in blood flowing in the microcirculation. He was nominated for the Nobel prize four times as a result of his discoveries. When I decided to have part of the meeting at the medical school, I invited Dr Haim Bicher to work with me from there and I focused on Clemson University and the combined meeting structure. As the meeting evolved, we decided it would be a good idea to establish an international society and call it the "International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue" (ISOTT). I wrote a paper on the pillars of our young society, "ISOTT from the Beginning: A Tribute to Our Deceased Members (Icons)," and another that shares more detail about its beginnings, "The Founding of ISOTT: The Shamattawa of Engineering Science and Medical Science". The roots of ISOTT are all the members, new and old, who continue to make valuable contributions to an exceedingly important component of human health. I hope that the society lasts for a long time, continuing to make important contributions to the medical world. It is a society that has been instrumental in bringing together brilliant scientists from the medical, engineering, and natural science fields to work together. It has contributed to the evolution of "bioengineering" as we know it today.</description>

                The universe began 13.8 billion years ago, and Earth was born 4.6 billion years ago. Early traces of life were found as soon as 4.1 billion years ago; then, ~200,000 years ago, the human being was born. The evolution of life on earth was to become individual rather than cellular life. The birth of mitochondria made this possible to be the individual life. Since then, individuals have had a limited time of life. It was 1.4 billion years ago that a bacterial cell began living inside an archaeal host cell, a form of endosymbiosis that is the development of eukaryotic cells, which contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments. The bacterium started to provide its host cell with additional energy, and the interaction eventually resulted in a eukaryotic cell, with both archaeal (the host cell) and bacterial (mitochondrial) origins still having genomes. The cells survived high concentrations of oxygen producing more energy inside the cell. Further, the roles of mitochondria in human being&#8217;s life and aging will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Exchange between Dust Aggregates and Ambient Nebular Gas</title>

                Abstract Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.</description>

                ABSTRACT Sufficiently old white dwarfs cool down through a convective envelope that directly couples their degenerate cores to the surface. Magnetic fields may inhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability. We consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution code mesa, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and magnetic field B. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that magnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time t even if they are relatively weak $B^2\ll 8\pi P$, where P is the pressure at the edge of the degenerate core. Fields $B\gtrsim 1\textrm {~MG}$ open a radiative window that decouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the luminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population of observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\Delta t\sim$ Gyr than currently thought due to this magnetic inhibition of convective energy transfer &#8211; comparable to the cooling delay due to carbon&#8211;oxygen phase separation. In volume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase with age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for accurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Structural and Chemical Evolution of Layered Oxide Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Water Vapor</title>

                Abstract Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) have received considerable attention as promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly for low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Currently, layered oxide compounds are considered the most important cathode materials for NIBs. However, they suffer from reduced capacity and a shortened lifespan when exposed to water vapor during storage or battery assembly. This article elaborates on the structural and chemical evolution of NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 (NFM) cathode at the atomic scale in a pure water vapor environment. The Na + /H + exchange induces the formation of a spinel&#8208;like phase via a multi&#8208;site nucleation mechanism. This transition preferentially occurs either at the cathode surface or along planar defects such as twin boundaries and grain boundaries. Additionally, numerous microcracks perpendicular to &lt;003&gt; direction appear inside NFM grains, further exacerbating the structural deterioration. Upon prolonged exposure to water vapor, NFM grains decompose into a mixture of Na 2 O and transition metal oxide nanoparticles (FeO, NiO, and MnO), accompanied by the generation of oxygen gas. This research provides a comprehensive atomic&#8208;scale insight into the water vapor instability mechanism of layered oxide cathodes, offering guidance for the design and manufacture of the next generation of water vapor&#8208;tolerant layered oxide cathodes in NIBs.</description>

      <title>An Artificial Intelligence-Based Platform for Medical Diagnosis</title>

                Medical diagnosis using artificial intelligence models uses methods of information collection via the Internet of Things (IoT) for the categorization of diseases. This may be attributed to a number different issues, such as inefficient auxiliary frameworks, high expenses associated with acquiring datasets, or difficulties encountered while constructing classifiers. The present paper analyses the recent developments in AI for medical diagnosis. The research uses a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to categorise medical conditions. In this paper, a model for categorising medical diagnosis has been introduced by making it easier for the network to adapt to new medical data. This article estimates the degree to which the classification falls into the right medical diagnosis category and separates the training sample into normal, critical, and suggestion samples using a dynamic threshold to solve the diagnostic issue. The recommended strategy categorises input to help the convolutional neural network learn more. This research modifies the convolutional neural network design to accommodate for input variety and data evolution temporal dynamics. This adjustment is made with the goal of achieving the five physiological data properties of bio signals (heart rate, blood pressure, EEG, ECG, and oxygen level). Because of the realised CNN optimisation algorithm model, the prediction effect has been increased, and the accuracy rate has been found to be 92.8% in medical diagnosis, which is a reasonably good performance in machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>A growth-coupling strategy for improving the stability of terpenoid bioproduction in Escherichia coli</title>

                Abstract Background Achieving cost-competitiveness remains challenging for industrial biomanufacturing. With whole-cell biocatalysis, inefficiency presents when individual cells vary in their production levels. The problem exacerbates when the basis for such production heterogeneity is heritable. Here, evolution selects for the low- and non-producers, as they have lowered/abolished the cost of bioproduction to fitness. With the scale of population expansion required for industrial bioproduction, the asymmetrical enrichment can be severe enough to compromise the performance, and hence commercial viability of the bioprocess. Clearly, addressing production heterogeneity is crucial, especially in improving the stability of bioproduction across the cell generations. In this respect, we designed a growth-coupling strategy for terpenoid bioproduction in Escherichia coli . By knocking out the native 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase ( dxr ) gene and introducing the heterologous mevalonate pathway, we created a chassis that relies solely on the latter for synthesis of all terpenoids. We hypothesise that the need to sustain the biosynthesis of endogenous life-sustaining terpenoids will impose a minimum level of productivity, which concomitantly improves the bioproduction of our target terpenoid. Results Following the confirmation of lethality of a dxr knockout, we challenged the strains with a continuous plasmid-based bioproduction of linalool. The &#916; dxr strain achieved an improved productivity profile in the first three days post-inoculation when compared to the parental strain. Productivity of the &#916; dxr strain remained observable near the end of 12 days, and after a disruption in nutrient and oxygen supply in a separate run. Unlike the parental strain, the &#916; dxr strain did not evolve the same deleterious mutations in the mevalonate pathway, nor a viable subgroup that had lost its resistance to the antibiotic selection pressure (a plausible plasmid loss event). We believe that this divergence in the evolution trajectories is indicative of a successful growth-coupling. Conclusion We have demonstrated a proof of concept of a growth-coupling strategy that improves the performance, and stability of terpenoid bioproduction across cell generations. The strategy is relatively broad in scope, and easy to implement in the background as a &#8216;fail-safe&#8217; against a fall in productivity below the imposed minimum. We thus believe this work will find widespread utility in our collective effort towards industrial bioproduction.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Conserved and Divergent Responses to Copper Zinc Superoxide Dismutase Inhibition in Plants</title>

                ABSTRACT After an initial evolution in a reducing environment, life got successively challenged by reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially during the great oxidation event (GOE) that followed the development of photosynthesis. Therefore, ROS are deeply intertwined into the physiological, morphological and transcriptional responses of most present&#8208;day organisms. Copper&#8208;zinc superoxide dismutases (CuZnSODs) evolved during the GOE and are present in charophytes and extant land plants, but nearly absent from chlorophytes. The chemical inhibitor of CuZnSOD, lung cancer screen 1 (LCS&#8208;1), could greatly facilitate the study of SODs in diverse plants. Here, we determined the impact of chemical inhibition of plant CuZnSOD activity, on plant growth, transcription and metabolism. We followed a comparative approach by using different plant species, including Marchantia Polymorpha and Physcomitrium patens, representing bryophytes, the sister lineage to vascular plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana . We show that LCS&#8208;1 causes oxidative stress in plants and that the inhibition of CuZnSODs provoked a similar core response that mainly impacted glutathione homoeostasis in all plant species analysed. That said, Physcomitrium and Arabidopsis, which contain multiple CuZnSOD isoforms showed a more complex and exacerbated response. In addition, an untargeted metabolomics approach revealed a specific metabolic signature for each plant species. Our comparative analysis exposes a conserved core response at the physiological and transcriptional level towards LCS&#8208;1, while the metabolic response largely varies. These differences correlate with the number and localization of the CuZnSOD isoforms present in each species.</description>

                Abstract We derive the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the Narrow Line Regions (NLRs) of a sample of 38 local (z &amp;lt; 0.4) Seyfert 2 nuclei. For that, we consider narrow optical emission line intensities and direct estimates of the electron temperatures (Te-method). We obtain a new theoretical expression for the nitrogen Ionization Correction Factor [ICF($\rm N^{+}$)] for NLRs. Applying this new ICF, we unexpectedly find that NLRs and disk H ii regions exhibit similar ICF distributions. We find nitrogen abundances in the range $7.6 \: &amp;lt; \: \rm 12+log(N/H) \: &amp;lt; \: 8.6$ (mean value 8.06 &#177; 0.22) or $\rm 0.4 \: &amp;lt; \: (N/N_{\odot }) \: &amp;lt; 4.7$, in the metallicity regime $8.3 \: &amp;lt; \: \rm 12+log(O/H) \: &amp;lt; \: 9.0$. Our results indicate that the dispersion in N/H abundance for a fixed O/H value in AGNs of &#8764;0.2 dex agrees with that for disc H ii regions with similar metallicity. We show that Seyfert 2 nuclei follow a similar (N/O)-(O/H) relation to the one followed by star-forming objects. Finally, we find that active galaxies called as &#8221;nitrogen-loud&#8221; observed at very high redshift (z &amp;gt; 5) show N/O values in consonance with those derived for local NLRs. This result indicates that the main star-formation event is completed in the early evolution stages of active galaxies.</description>

                Abstract. Effective observation of the ocean is vital for studying and assessing the state and evolution of the marine ecosystem and for evaluating the impact of human activities. However, obtaining comprehensive oceanic measurements across temporal and spatial scales and for different biogeochemical variables remains challenging. Autonomous oceanographic instruments, such as Biogeochemical (BGC)-Argo profiling floats, have helped expand our ability to obtain subsurface and deep-ocean measurements, but measuring biogeochemical variables, such as nutrient concentration, still remains more demanding and expensive than measuring physical variables. Therefore, developing methods to estimate marine biogeochemical variables from high-frequency measurements is very much needed. Current neural network (NN) models developed for this task are based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture, trained over point-wise pairs of input&#8211;output features. Although MLPs can produce smooth outputs if the inputs change smoothly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are inherently designed to handle profile data effectively. In this study, we present a novel one-dimensional (1D) CNN model to predict profiles leveraging the typical shape of vertical profiles of a variable as a prior constraint during training. In particular, the Predict Profiles Convolutional (PPCon) model predicts nitrate, chlorophyll, and backscattering (bbp700) starting from the date and geolocation and from temperature, salinity, and oxygen profiles. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using a robust BGC-Argo dataset collected in the Mediterranean Sea for training and validation. Results, which include quantitative metrics and visual representations, prove the capability of PPCon to produce smooth and accurate profile predictions improving upon previous MLP applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic microbiome diversity shaping the adaptation of sponge holobionts in coastal waters</title>

                ABSTRACT The microbial communities associated with sponges contribute to the adaptation of hosts to environments, which are essential for the trophic transformation of benthic-marine coupling. However, little is known about the symbiotic microbial community interactions and adaptative strategies of high- and low-microbial abundance (HMA and LMA) sponges, which represent two typical ecological phenotypes. Here, we compared the 1-year dynamic patterns of microbiomes with the HMA sponge Spongia officinalis and two LMA sponge species Tedania sp. and Haliclona simulans widespread on the coast of China. Symbiotic bacterial communities with the characteristic HMA&#8211;LMA dichotomy presented higher diversity and stability in S. officinalis than in Tedania sp. and H. simulans , while archaeal communities showed consistent diversity across all sponges throughout the year. Dissolved oxygen, dissolved inorganic phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus, and especially temperature were the major factors affecting the seasonal changes in sponge microbial communities. S. officinalis -associated microbiome had higher diversity, stronger stability, and closer interaction, which adopted a relatively isolated strategy to cope with environmental changes, while Tedania sp. and H. simulans were more susceptible and shared more bacterial Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) with surrounding waters, with an open way facing the uncertainty of the environment. Meta-analysis of the microbiome in composition, diversity, and ecological function from 13 marine sponges further supported that bacterial communities associated with HMA and LMA sponges have evolved two distinct environmental adaptation strategies. We propose that the different adaptive ways of sponges responding to the environment may be responsible for their successful evolution and their competence in global ocean change. IMPORTANCE During long-term evolution, sponge holobionts, among the oldest symbiotic relationships between microbes and metazoans, developed two distinct phenotypes with high- and low-microbial abundance (HMA and LMA). Despite sporadic studies indicating that the characteristic microbial assemblages present in HMA and LMA sponges, the adaptation strategies of symbionts responding to environments are still unclear. This deficiency limits our understanding of the selection of symbionts and the ecological functions during the evolutionary history and the adaptative assessment of HMA and LMA sponges in variable environments. Here, we explored symbiotic communities with two distinct phenotypes in a 1-year dynamic environment and combined with the meta-analysis of 13 sponges. The different strategies of symbionts in adapting to the environment were basically drawn: microbes with LMA were more acclimated to environmental changes, forming relatively loose-connected communities, while HMA developed relatively tight-connected and more similar communities beyond the divergence of species and geographical location.</description>

      <title>The warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in inter-cluster filaments -- A
  forecast for HUBS observations based on eRASS1 superclusters</title>

                Cosmological simulations indicate that nearly half of the baryons in the nearby Universe are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase, with about half of which residing in cosmic filaments. Recent observational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy cluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excess associated with optically identified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in filaments remain largely undetermined due to the lack of direct spectral diagnostics. In this work, we aim to select appropriate targets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV level energy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a 1 square degree field-of-view. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) supercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission, and used their modeled geometrical properties and oxygen line intensities to select four most appropriate candidate targets for HUBS observations. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we demonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas properties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the temperature constrained to +-0.01 keV, metallicity constrained to &lt; +-0.03 solar, and density constrained to &lt; +-10%. Elemental abundance of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing unprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas. We also showed that direct mapping of the WHIM distribution is promising with narrow-band imaging of the O viii line. Our work forecasts that next-generation X-ray missions such as HUBS will provide substantial improvement in our understanding of the physical status and evolution history of the diffuse WHIM gas in cosmic large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of submillimeter functional quantitative susceptibility mapping using 3D echo planar imaging at 7 T</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.5263</link>

                Abstract Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a tool for mapping tissue susceptibility. Using QSM for functional brain mapping, it is possible to directly quantify blood&#8208;oxygen&#8208;level&#8208;dependent (BOLD) susceptibility changes. This study presents a submillimeter functional QSM (fQSM) approach compared to BOLD fMRI from data acquired with 3D gradient&#8208;echo echo planar imaging (EPI) at ultra&#8208;high field. Complex EPI data were acquired in nine healthy subjects with varying temporal and spatial resolutions and used for BOLD fMRI and for fQSM. Right&#8208;hand finger tapping experiments were performed as well as one measurement with intentional subject movement. Susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path&#8208;based unwrapping, the variable&#8208;kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data, and the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithm. Functional data analysis included general linear modeling and computation of z &#8208;scores. Submillimeter data were denoised using NOise reduction with DIstribution Corrected (NORDIC), which improved z &#8208;scores in the motor cortex for fQSM and fMRI. An expected increase in BOLD fMRI signal and corresponding decrease in magnetic susceptibility was observed in sensorimotor areas during active periods. For all experiments, fQSM showed smaller activation regions compared with fMRI. The percentage of high negative t &#8208;values localized in the cortex was higher for fQSM (52%) than for positive or negative t &#8208;values for fMRI (45%). For the scans with intentional motion, movement exceeded the size of a voxel, but paradigm dependent signal evolution could be recovered using motion correction. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of submillimeter whole&#8208;brain fQSM with voxel volume of 0.53 &#956;L. In comparison to traditional BOLD fMRI, fQSM provided improved localization of brain activation within the cortex, especially in submillimeter 3D EPI sequences.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Fuel-Borne Nitrogen Pollutants in Hydrogen-Ammonia Mixtures Using Argon-Oxygen Atmosphere Under Engine Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4066876</link>

                Abstract Amid climate change, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy sources is crucial. Ammonia, a carbon-free and renewable fuel, shows significant potential as an alternative energy source. By incorporating hydrogen as an additive, its flammability can be enhanced to suit existing spark ignition engines. However, understanding the characteristics of nitrogen pollutant emissions (i.e., NOx, which includes NO and NO2, and N2O) from ammonia-hydrogen combustion is challenging due to contributions from both fuel-borne and air-borne nitrogen. However, understanding the characteristics of nitrogen pollutant emissions from ammonia-hydrogen combustion is challenging due to contributions from both fuel-borne and air-borne nitrogen. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants during ammonia-hydrogen combustion is essential. This study focuses on investigating fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants in an argon-oxygen atmosphere, thereby eliminating nitrogen from the oxidizer and its role in thermal NOx formation. The research examines the formation and evolution of fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants during ammonia-hydrogen combustion under engine-like conditions. Results indicate that fuel-borne nitrogen pollutants act as intermediates, potentially originating from chemical equilibrium. While fuel NO predominantly forms in the burning zone, it undergoes reduction in the burned zone. N2O, absent in thermal NOx mechanisms, shows significant concentrations in the burning zone and is mostly converted to N2, leading to limited N2O in the final fuel-borne nitrogen pollutant concentration. Lean burn conditions, hydrogen addition, and oxyfuel combustion promote fuel NOx formation. Additionally, the equivalence ratio affects the ammonia-hydrogen premixed flame structure due to the de-NOx effect of ammonia. Overall, these findings highlight that fuel-borne nitrogen pollutant mechanisms differ from thermal NOx mechanisms, necessitating specially designed reduction technologies for clean spark ignition engines.</description>

                Gold mineralization in the Gilt Edge deposit was closely associated with magmatic differentiation and the formation of a Tertiary alkaline intrusive complex within the Lead&#8211;Deadwood dome.. Fluid inclusions and trace element geochemistry were used to study fluid evolution and determine sources. Quartz disseminated in unaltered trachyte porphyry hosts two populations of primary inclusions: 1) hypersaline i S&#8211;L&#8211;V a red hematite crystal and 2) mixtures of L&#8211;V and V&#8211; L that record phase separation at ~700oC. Whereas samples of hydrothermal quartz collected from in ore zones within and beyond structures (e.g., fault and breccia zones) contain dominant populations of V&#8211;L and L&#8211;V inclusions, respectively. Mineralization in structures formed from complex fluids of magmatic origin based on inclusions containing five transparent salt crystals and opaque crystals with cubic and round habits that have homogenization temperatures (Th) 650oC and salinities 63 wt.% NaCl equiv. In contrast, broader areas of disseminated mineralization in argillized and propylitized rocks contain hydrothermal quartz hosting large populations of L&#8211;V inclusions with Th of 200o360oC and salinities of 10&#8211;30 wt.% NaCl equiv., which reflect fluid mixing. Trace element concentrations are significantly higher in samples from structures and define zones of near surface Ag&#8211;As&#8211;Zn&#8211;Pb and deep Au&#8211;W&#8211;Mo&#8211;Cu. Whereas low trace element concentrations characterize propylitized quartz trachyte porphyry, except for high concentrations of Sb and Hg that occur at depth and likely track the retreat of isotherms as the hydrothermal system collapsed. These data show that during differentiation in a deep magma chamber, volatile-rich low-density fluids were periodically degassed into preexisting structures that were reactivated. Gold deposition during four stages of mineralization likely occurred due to boiling, changes in oxygen fugacity, and fluid mixing.</description>

                Goethite often harbors impurities, such as phosphorus (P) and aluminum (Al), which are incorporated into its structure through direct substitution or coprecipitation with nanocrystalline phases. Understanding the processes that drive the release of P and Al from goethite is of paramount importance for the iron ore industry and for managing nutrient and pollutant behavior in the environment. This study investigates the impact of Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization on the release of P and Al from goethite. We evaluated the solubility and extractability of P and Al in suspensions of Al- and P-coprecipitated goethite, treated with 57Fe-enriched Fe(II)aq under oxygen-free conditions for 30 days at neutral pH and room temperatures. The addition of Fe(II)aq induced the recrystallization of goethite dominant initial synthetic phases (i.e., low P- and Al-containing phases) and the transformation of higher P- and/or Al-bearing starting material that was actually a mixture of goethite and minor amounts of lepidocrocite and feroxyhyte. Our results reveal that Fe(II)-catalyzed mineral and structural evolution led to the repartitioning of P and, to a lesser extent, Al throughout the crystal structure, mineral surface, and aqueous solution. Following a 30 day reaction with Fe(II)aq, we extracted approximately 80, 68.8, 73.9, and 83.2% of P from P-only, low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. Additionally, we observed total Al removals of approximately 17, 27, and 25% from low, medium, and high P + Al goethite, respectively. The results demonstrate that treating both P-only and P + Al goethite with Fe(II) at room temperature, followed by a 24 h extraction using 1 M NaOH, significantly enhances the overall extractability of P and Al, including both aqueous and surface-adsorbed fractions, compared to Fe(II)-free controls. These findings advance our understanding of the recrystallization process and impurity substitution in goethite, offering promising avenues for developing new environmentally friendly methods to extract P and other impurities from goethitic iron ores at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>The genome and comparative transcriptome of the euryhaline model ciliate Paramecium duboscqui reveal adaptations to environmental salinity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-024-02026-5</link>
      <description>Yu Fu, Ping Ni, Qian Zhang, Fasheng Liang, Naomi A. Stover, Lifang Li, BMC Biology. 22(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403439852

                As a potential model organism for studies of environmental and cell biology, Paramecium duboscqui is a special euryhaline species of Paramecium that can be found in fresh, brackish, or marine water in natural salinity ranges between 0&#8240; and 33&#8240;. However, the genome information as well as molecular mechanisms that account for its remarkable halotolerant traits remain extremely unknown. To characterize its genome feature, we combined PacBio and Illumina sequencing to assemble the first high-quality and near-complete macronuclear genome of P. duboscqui. Meanwhile, comparative transcriptomic profiles under different salinities gave underlying insight into the molecular mechanism of its adaptations to environmental salinity. The results showed that the MAC genome of P. duboscqui comprises 160 contigs, with 113 of them possessing telomere (~ 28.82 Mb haploid genome size). Through comparative genomic analyses with the other ciliate, we found that gene families encoding transmembrane transporter proteins have been expanded in P. duboscqui, showing enormous potential in salinity adaptation. Like other Paramecium, P. duboscqui utilizes TGA as its only termination codon and has reassigned TAA and TAG to encode glutamine. P. duboscqui showed different growth rates under different salinities, with an optimum growth rate in 5&#8240; salinity. A comparison of the transcriptomic profiles among P. duboscqui grown under different concentrations showed that genes involved in protein folding, oxygen respiration, and glutathione-dependent detoxification were upregulated in the high-salt group, whereas genes encoding DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors were upregulated in the low-salt group, suggesting distinct mechanisms for responding to low and high salinity. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) linked the hub genes expressed at 30&#8240; salinity to cysteine-type peptidase activity, lipid transfer, sodium hydrogen exchange, and cell division, with the hub genes expressed at 0&#8240; salinity involved in transmembrane transport and protein localization. This study characterizes a new euryhaline model Paramecium, provides novel insights into Paramecium evolution, and describes the molecular mechanisms that have allow P. duboscqui to adapt to different osmotic environments.</description>

                Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2 ) cathode material, with its high energy density and operating voltage, is currently a mainstream material for lithium-ion battery cathodes. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, &amp;nbsp;the &amp;nbsp;crystal &amp;nbsp;structure &amp;nbsp;collapse &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;lattice &amp;nbsp;oxygen &amp;nbsp;evolution under high-voltage conditions lead to rapid capacity decay, severely limiting its practical applications. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This paper &amp;nbsp;analyzes the main factors affecting the cycle performance and rate performance of lithium cobalt oxide, considering the physic- ochemical properties of the particles, including elemental content and particle size, and provides a mathematical model linking these properties to electrochemical per- formance. &amp;nbsp;The study offers insights for the practical production of high-voltage lithium cobalt oxide materials. At the beginning, we embarked on investigating the correlation between the physicochemical attributes (encompassing elemental composition and particle size) of lithium cobalt oxide and its cycle performance. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression model was formulated, yielding a robust fit with an R-Squared value of 0.94. This model was subsequently optimized through the application of an XGBoost algorithm, achieving an R-Squared value nearing unity, signifying a remarkable enhancement in model accuracy. Visual analysis of the results pinpointed the primary determinants of cycle performance, arranged in descending order of significance: 'Cycle Index,' Mg content, particle size distribution (D10), Zn, and Al. Then, our attention shifted to examining the link between the aforementioned physicochemical characteristics and the rate performance of lithium cobalt oxide. The Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk tests confirmed the normality of the data, fulfilling the prerequisites for hypothesis testing. An OLS linear regression model was developed, demonstrating a strong goodness-of-fit with an R-Squared value exceeding 0.8. This model was further honed with an XGBoost model, which achieved an R-Squared score approaching 1, indicating a substantial refinement in model precision. The visualization of model outcomes illuminated the key factors influencing rate performance, ranked in descending order of importance: particle size distribution (D50), Al, Mn, Zn, Mg, Ni, and Fe. Lastly, we devised an optimal strategy that encompasses the incorporation of strategic doping elements, the utilization of high-temperature sol-gel methods to bolster cycle performance, and coating modifications aimed at enhancing rate performance. This holistic approach fosters the structural stability of lithium cobalt oxide crystals, fortifying their high-potential cycle capabilities, and concurrently elevating their rate performance.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effect of Aligned Microtube Density on the Mechanical Strength of Hydrogel Scaffolds</title>

                Abstract Tissue engineering is a pivotal research domain, central to advancing biomedical manufacturing processes with the aim of fabricating functional artificial organs and tissues. Addressing the pressing concern of organ shortages and myriad medical challenges necessitates innovative manufacturing techniques. Hydrogel scaffolds, due to their biocompatibility and extracellular matrix-mimicking porous structure, have emerged as prime candidates in this arena. Moreover, their hygroscopic properties and tunable mechanical characteristics render them suitable for various tissue engineering applications. Despite their promising attributes, a significant manufacturing challenge persists: the optimization of cellular growth within the confines of hydrogel scaffolds. Effective vascularization, essential for optimal cellular nutrient and oxygen supply, remains elusive. Our previous manufacturing research tackled this, introducing a novel hybrid Bio-Fabrication technique. This technique integrated coaxial electrospinning and extrusion-based bioprinting methodologies, yielding hydrogel scaffolds fortified with microtubes. These strategically embedded microtubes, modeled after capillary structures, function as microchannel diffusion conduits, enhancing cellular viability within the hydrogel matrix. A core aspect of scaffold manufacturing is ensuring the stability of its 3D architecture, especially post-swelling. Preliminary hypotheses suggest a gamut of factors &#8212; including microtube shape, size, orientation, alignment, and density &#8212; play determinant roles in shaping the scaffold&#8217;s mechanical attributes. This research rigorously examines the mechanical evolution of hydrogel scaffolds when supplemented with aligned electrospun microtubes across a spectrum of densities. A blend of sodium alginate (SA) and gelatin was selected for the hydrogel matrix due to their inherent biocompatibility and favorable mechanical properties. Different concentrations were prepared to assess the optimal mixture for mechanical stability. A co-axial electrospinning setup was employed where polycaprolactone (PCL) was used as the sheath material and polyethylene oxide (PEO) functioned as the core. This dual material approach was intended to leverage the structural rigidity of PCL with the biodegradability of PEO. The spinning parameters, including voltage, flow rate, and tip-to-collector distance, were meticulously adjusted to produce aligned microtubes of varied densities and diameters. Once the microtubes were synthesized, they were layered within the hydrogel constructs. The layering process involved depositing a hydrogel layer, positioning the microtubes, and then sealing with another hydrogel layer. The entire structure was then solidified using calcium chloride, resulting in a robust, multi-layered composite. Post-fabrication, the hydrogel scaffolds underwent mechanical evaluations. Compression tests were employed to measure the compressive modulus. Tensile tests were conducted to determine ultimate tensile strength. These tests were crucial to understanding the impact of microtube density on the overall mechanical properties of the hydrogel scaffolds. The high-density group, while showing improved mechanical properties over the control group, did not surpass the low-density group, suggesting a possible saturation point. In conclusion, our research methodically explored the influence of microtube density on the mechanical and structural attributes of hydrogel scaffolds. The manufacturing insights gleaned hold substantive implications, promising to propel the field of tissue engineering and drive transformative advancements in biomedical manufacturing.</description>
