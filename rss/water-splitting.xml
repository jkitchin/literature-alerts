                Abstract Alkali&#8208;metal doped perovskite oxides have emerged as promising materials due to their unique properties and broad applications in various fields, including photovoltaics and catalysis. Understanding the complex interplay between alkali metal doping, structural modifications, and their impact on performance remains a crucial challenge. In this study, this challenge is addressed by investigating the synthesis and properties of Rb&#8208;doped perovskite oxides. These results reveal that the doping of Rb into perovskite oxides function as a structural modifier in the as&#8208;synthesized samples and during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well. Electron microscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations confirm the enrichment of Rb on the surface of the as&#8208;synthesized sample. Further investigations into the electrocatalytic reaction revealed that the Rb&#8208;doped perovskite underwent drastic restructuring with Rb leaching and formation of strontium oxide.</description>

      <title>FeN&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnSe/Fe Heterojunctions Embedded in Leafy N-Doped Carbon as Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts for Flexible Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c01603</link>

                Flexible quasi-solid zinc&#8211;air batteries, known for their efficiency and promising potential as an energy storage system, have found extensive applications in the fields of portable power supply, wildlife rescue, and flexible wearable devices. Herein, a FeNx/ZnSe/Fe heterojunction nanocomposite anchored on leafy nitrogen-doped carbon (FeNx/ZnSe/Fe&#8211;NC) is developed as a highly active bifunctional catalyst via one-step high-temperature selenization of Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks 8. The formation of the heterostructure FeNx/ZnSe/Fe is conducive to accelerating electron transfer and improving the activity of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, FeNx/ZnSe/Fe&#8211;NC exhibits exceptional performance in liquid Zn&#8211;air batteries, comparable to the potency of industrially produced catalysts fabricated from precious metals. Notably, the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with a double-network structure, composed of poly(vinyl alcohol)- and polyacrylamide-modified with dimethyl sulfoxide (PVA&#8211;PAM&#8211;DMSO), exhibits significantly higher conductivity (193.5 mS cm&#8211;1) and excellent water retention (93.6%). As a result of the FeNx/ZnSe/Fe&#8211;NC catalyst and PVA&#8211;PAM&#8211;DMSO GPE, a flexible Zn&#8211;air battery with high-rate capability has been achieved, which demonstrates a high open-circuit potential of 1.51 V. This battery displays exceptional performance with excellent durability, adaptability, and adjustment capacity across a broad temperature range.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of High-Entropy Perovskite Hydroxides as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17122963</link>
      <description>Sangwoo Chae, Akihito Shio, Takayoshi Kishida, Kosuke Furutono, Yuki Kojima, Gasidit Panomsuwan, Takahiro Ishizaki, Materials. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399731602

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolutionc reaction (OER) are important chemical reactions for a rechargeable lithium&#8211;oxygen battery (LOB). Recently, high-entropy alloys and oxides have attracted much attention because they showed good electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and/or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we aimed to synthesize and characterize CoSn(OH)6 and two types of high-entropy perovskite hydroxides, that is, (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Mg0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMMSOH) and (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMNSOH). TEM observation and XRD measurements revealed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH had cubic crystals with sides of approximately 150&#8211;200 nm and crystal structures similar to those of perovskite-type CSOH. LSV measurement results showed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH showed bifunctional catalytic functions for the ORR and OER. CCFMNSOH showed better catalytic performance than CCFMMSOH.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Metal Impurities on NiOOH Electrocatalytic Activity in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202400223</link>
      <description>No&#235; I. Watson, M.B.T. Keegan, Bart Van den Bosch, Ning Yan, Gadi Rothenberg, ChemElectroChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399740209

                Abstract The energy transition and the implementation of new electrochemical technologies will result in an increased reliance on critical raw materials for electrodes. Their large&#8208;scale application will ultimately mean working with lower grade materials. Here we study the influence of metal impurities on nickel foam electrocatalysts. We do this by electrodepositing known amounts of first&#8208;row transition metals (Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) on nickel foam and studying their performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model reaction. The electrodes&#8217; performance is studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel analysis, stepwise chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Combining these results with microscopy analysis, we show that even small amounts of transition&#8208;metal impurities have profound effects on the catalytic performance of nickel electrodes. The changes affect the OER onset potential (the energy that the system requires to convert OH &#8211; to O 2 ) and the Tafel slope of each electrode (the electrode's initial activity in the OER onset region). Our results highlight the implications of such impurities on electrode design and future large&#8208;scale application.</description>

      <title>Effect of pH on the Selectivity of &#947;&#8208;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrocatalysts towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction in the Presence of Chloride Ions in Alkaline Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202400220</link>
      <description>Matthew D. Finn, B. J. Weathers, Bethany M. Hudak, Olga A. Baturina, ChemElectroChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399740275

                Abstract In this manuscript, we explore the effect of pH on the selectivity of a hydrothermally synthesized nanostructured &#947;&#8208;MnO 2 electrocatalyst in the alkaline environment. Selectivity of electrodeposited &#947;&#8208;MnO 2 toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M NaCl at pH 12 has been demonstrated by Fujimura et al (Mat. Sci. Eng., A267 (1999) 254&#8211;259). Herein, we extend the pH region from pH 8.2 to pH 13 and demonstrate by thin&#8208;film rotating disk electrode (RDE) method that the catalyst is selective toward the OER at current densities up to ca 15 mA/cm 2 in the entire range of pH, if buffer is utilized to mitigate the effect of local pH. In synthetic seawater, at pH 8.2, the catalyst is not selective toward the OER. The analysis of the OER Tafel slopes at low current densities (&lt;3 mA/cm 2 ) shows that the slopes were not affected by pH in 0.5 M NaCl solutions, which suggests the same OER mechanism. At the same time, reaction rate decreased with decrease in pH. Nafion ionomer in the catalyst layer may adversely affect the catalyst's performance at pH &#8804;12 by limiting diffusion of OH &#8722; ions through the Nafion film. Catalyst layers need to be carefully designed to avoid negative effects of Nafion.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study of oxygen evolution reaction using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin-film electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0203381</link>

                The development of water electrolysis catalysts that accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial challenge. Ni-based oxides are promising OER catalysts; however, quantitative studies of Ni-based oxides remain unexplored. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the OER activity of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as a thin-film electrode catalyst. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin film fabricated using a sputtering method exhibited a current density of 6.6 and &#8764;2.6 mAcm&#8722;2 for geometric and estimated areas, respectively, at 1.78 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Ni3+ in the as-grown and post-OER LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin films. These results suggest that Ni3+ plays a key role in the OER of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4.</description>

      <title>Phosphorous Vacancy and Built&#8208;In Electric Field Effect of Co&#8208;Doped MoP@MXene Heterostructures to Tune Catalytic Activity for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202400304</link>
      <description>Jiacheng Zhang, Xinying Wang, Feixiang Du, Wu Jian, Shengfu Xiao, Yunfeng Zhou, Hao Wu, Zhuhang Shao, Weitong Cai, Yunyong Li, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399753123

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective, durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial but remains challenging due to slow hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics in water electrolysis. Herein, a combined engineering strategy of phosphorous vacancy (V p ) and spontaneous built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) is proposed to design novel highly&#8208;conductive Co&#8208;doped MoP@MXene heterostructures with phosphorous vacancy (V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene). Wherein, Co doping regulates the surface electronic structure and charge re&#8208;distribution of MoP, V p induces more defects and active sites, while BIEF accelerates the interfacial charge transfer rate between V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP and MXene. Therefore, the synergistic integration of V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP/MXene efficiently decreases activation energy and kinetic barrier, thus promoting its intrinsically catalytic activity and structural stability. Consequently, the V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene catalyst displays low overpotentials of 102.3/196.5 and 265.0/320.0 mV at 10/50 mA cm &#8722;2 for HER and OER, respectively. Notably, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzers with the V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene bifunctional catalysts to achieve 10/50 mA cm &#8722;2 , only need low&#8208;cell voltages of 1.57/1.64 V in alkaline media. Besides, experimental and theoretical results confirm that the hetero&#8208;structure effectively reduces hydrogen adsorption free energy and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step energy barrier of OER intermediates, thereby greatly boosting its intrinsically catalytic activity. This work verifies an effective strategy to fabricate efficient non&#8208;precious bifunctional electro&#8208;catalysts for water splitting via combination engineering of phosphorous vacancy, cation doping, and BIEF.</description>

      <title>Oxygen vacancy-enhanced Ni3FeN/NF nanoparticle catalysts for efficient and stable electrolytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2024.144607</link>
      <description>Xianghao Meng, Xin Zhao, Yulin Min, Yiting Peng, Qiaoxia Li, Wei Cai, Electrochimica acta. 497(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399753345

                The highly effective and economical electrocatalysts hold great importance in the context of water electrolysis. In this work, a nanosheet catalyst (Ni3FeN/NF) composed of nanoparticles for comprehensive water splitting was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal technique followed by a subsequent nitridation process. This catalyst is endowed with an abundance of oxygen vacancies, thereby conferring a richer array of active sites. Therefore, the catalyst demonstrates a markedly low overpotential for the OER of 271 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and an equally low overpotential for the HER of 35 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Serving as a dual-function electrode, this electrocatalyst is employed in overall water splitting in alkaline environments, demonstrating impressive efficiency of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.45 V. In-situ Raman spectroscopy was employed to elucidate the active phase and dynamic surface structure of the Ni3FeN/NF catalyst by conducting measurements at intervals of 0.1 V. At open circuit voltage (OCV), Ni3FeN/NF exhibited pronounced peaks at 532 and 702 cm&#8722;1. Notably, at potentials exceeding 1.40 V, distinct peaks were observed at 473 and 551 cm&#8722;1. The manifestation of these dual peaks indicates that &#947;-Ni(Fe)OOH serves as the predominant active species in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism for Ni3FeN/NF.</description>

                The Ni-based coordination compounds, during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), self-reconstruct to produce NiOOH, which are the real active sites. Thus, encouraging the self-reconstruction of pre-catalysts to generate more NiOOH species...</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution by polymerised porphyrins &#8211; An investigation on the role of conformation on electropolymerisation and on catalytic activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.139044</link>
      <description>G. Umesh, P. Bhavana, Journal of molecular structure. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399757157

                An investigation on the effectiveness of oxygen evolution with different porphyrin as electrode modifying agents (electrocatalyst) is carried out in the present work. The intention of the work was to correlate the conformation of the porphyrins with their extent of electropolymerisation and in turn, its effect on oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Of the three meso-arylporphyrin studied, cobalt derivative of 2-thienylporphyrin is found to be the best in electropolymerisation and in activity for OER. The stability of this modified electrode as catalyst is higher compared to the other two cases where the extent of electropolymerisation is less as evidenced from UV visible spectral details and SEM images. Also it showed good Faradaic efficiency. This study throws light on the role of electropolymerisation in improving the activity of complexes in employing them as functional materials</description>

      <title>Thermally Labile Organic-Soluble Heterometal Diorganophosphate-Derived Efficient Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Heterometal phosphates are burgeoning electrocatalysts and cathode materials in energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we demonstrate a novel and clean synthetic route for substoichiometric lithium-deficient metastable Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 (Li-Co-P-HEX) and metaphosphate P212121-LiCo(PO3)3 (Li-Co-P-BT), starting from the same starting material [LiCo(dtbp)3] (dtbp = di-tert-butyl phosphate) through a thermolytic single-source precursor approach. The heterometal organophosphate [LiCo(dtbp)3] decomposed into different phases of inorganic heterometal phosphates by employing a solution and solid-state thermal treatment. The solution-processed Li-deficient orthophosphate exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at an overpotential of 294 mV, outperforming other reported lithium&#8211;cobalt phosphates for water oxidation. The enhanced performance of the Cmcm-Li0.65(7)Co1.16(2)PO4 as an electrocatalyst elucidates the synergistic effect generated by the structure, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Electrochemical Transformations on a Metal-Oxide Surface during Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05931</link>

                Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamic structural evolution of oxygen vacancies enriched SrFe12O19 for efficient reverse water gas shift reaction</title>

                The Reverse Water-Gas Shift (rWGS) reaction is recognized as a potentially promising pathway to serve the dual purpose, possible shifting of CO2 from a linear economy to a circular and positive economic impact in the current industrial process. This study is engaged to develop a series of oxygen vacancies enriched M&#8722;type strontium hexaferrite (SrFe12O19) catalysts via doping of transition metals like Cu, Zn, Co, and Ni for the rWGS reaction. Cu-doped SrFe12O19 exhibited 100 % CO selectivity and a CO production rate of 2850 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat-1, at a comparatively lower temperature (500 &#176;C), outpacing the performance of almost all non-precious metal-based catalytic systems. Moreover, the catalyst was active without the requirement of the H2 pre-reduction procedure and displayed remarkable stability tested up to 200 h without any significant deactivation, making it more industrially relevant. The characterization of as-prepared catalysts indicates the enrichment of oxygen vacancies and reducibility after the involvement of the dopant in the SrFe12O19 system. The formation of various iron species (Fe3O4, Fe3C, and Fe5C2) was revealed by the in-situ studies and post-reaction characterizations of the catalyst system, and their relative amounts were significantly affected by the nature of doping elements, which subsequently influenced the CO selectivity. The dynamic structural evolution and surface-adsorbed species were identified using in-situ Raman and DRIFTS studies. Finally, the structure&#8211;activity relationship was rationalized through not only several ex-situ/in-situ characterization techniques but also an in-detailed Density functional theory (DFT) study.</description>

      <title>A Review on Highly Efficient Ru-Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is seen as the most compatible hydrogen production technology with renewable energy generation. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the scarcity of acid-resistant, high-activity, and low-cost catalysts have seriously hindered the overall efficiency and manufacturing costs of PEMWE. Recently, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials have gradually attracted attention due to their suitable binding strength toward oxygen intermediates and lowest price in the noble metal family. Herein, the great achievements and progress of Ru-based acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively reviewed, which started with a general description of reaction mechanisms and in situ characterization techniques to understand the structure&#8211;activity relationships. Subsequently, some typical strategies to enhance the activity and stability of Ru-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. Insights from synthesis methods, advanced characterizations, intermediate evolution, and theoretical calculations are provided, together with our viewpoints on the daunting challenges and future endeavors of Ru-based OER electrocatalysts for their practical employment.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Electro-oxidation Mechanism of 5-Aminotetrazole on Nickel-Based Oxides and Synthesizing 5,5&#8242;-Azotetrazolate Salts</title>

                With the gradual expansion of the application of organic electromechanical synthesis in the field of energetic materials, it is necessary to explore deeply the mechanisms behind the organic electromechanical oxidation of energetic materials in order to develop efficient electrocatalysts. Electrochemical synthesis of 5,5&#8242;-azotetrazolate (ZT) salts is not only environmentally friendly and efficient but also can replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER) combined with hydrogen production, significantly reducing the battery voltage of overall water splitting (OWS) and achieving low energy consumption hydrogen production. Here, we prepared the Co-modified nickel-based oxide electrodes (Ni3&#8211;xCoO4/carbon cloth (CC), x = 1, 2) as a medium to reveal the oxidative coupling mechanism of 5-aminotetrazole (5-AT). Experimental and theoretical calculations verified that Ni-catalyzed oxidative coupling of 5-AT is a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, including electron transfer of electrocatalytic intermediates (Ni2+&#8211;O + OH&#8211; = Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) + e&#8211;) and spontaneous dehydrogenation process (Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;O + X&#8226;). The Ni3+&#8211;O(OH) is an extremely fast nonreducing electron transfer center that serves as a chemical oxidant to directly abstract hydrogen atoms from the 5-AT. Simultaneously, the synergistic effect of Co doping on the electric cloud around Ni causes the upshift of the d-band centers, which is conducive to the easier adsorption of OH*, forming the generation of active intermediate Ni3+&#8211;O(OH). Thus, Ni2CoO4/CC has higher Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield for the oxidation reaction of 5-AT, with a yield of approximately 72.3% after electrolysis at 1.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).</description>

                Exploiting highly active bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts for reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with CoFe alloys and Fe2N (denoted as CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs) has been successfully constructed. The introduction of Fe2N can not only regulate the electronic structure of the FeCo alloy but also provide sufficient metal-Nx catalytic sites. Besides, the strong synergistic effect among CoFe alloy, Fe2N, and N-CNTs endows CoFe/Fe2N@N-CNTs with prominent bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance toward ORR and OER (&#916;E = 0.669 V), superior to that of the FeCo alloy@N-CNTs without Fe2N and commercial precious metal-based catalyst. Importantly, the assembled aqueous Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB) possesses a high open-circuit voltage (1.60 V), high peak power density (173 mW cm&#8211;2), and prominent good charge&#8211;discharge stability (1000 h), surpassing commercial precious metal catalysts.</description>

      <title>pH Effects on Electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production and Flooding in Gas-Diffusion Electrodes for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c02325</link>

                Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) is a crucial process for on-site and on-demand H2O2 production. Evaluating the impact of the medium's pH is essential for achieving selective H2O2 production at higher current density through continuous O2 supply to gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) in membrane electrolyzers. We investigated the effect of electrolyte pH on both H2O2 production and the flooding behavior of GDEs loaded with a cobalt single-atom catalyst in a typical H-type cell. The electrocatalyst was prepared by heating cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin loaded on Ketjen Black (CoTPP/KB) at 750 &#176;C. Remarkably, the cobalt single-atom catalyst exhibited high current density when the top of the hydrophobic gas-diffusion layer was exposed to the gas phase, facilitating efficient O2 diffusion within the GDE. Potential&#8211;time curves at &#8722;40 mA cm&#8211;2 showed stable potentials and Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;80%) over 5 h across a pH range from 1 to 10, with the H2O2 concentration reaching approximately 100 mmol L&#8211;1 at pH 1.0. In contrast, the potential at pH 13 decreased abruptly in 3 h due to the flooding of GDE. Long-term tests demonstrated stable electrocatalytic H2O2 production only in the acidic electrolytes for 24 h, attributed to reduced flooding with decreasing pH. These findings underscore the impact of electrolyte pH on GDE performance during H2O2 production via the 2e&#8211; ORR, with acidity favoring the mitigation of undesirable flooding behavior.</description>

                Abstract The inefficiency of electrocatalysts for water splitting in neutral media stems from a comprehensive impact of poor intrinsic activity, a limited number of active sites, and inadequate mass transport. Herein, hierarchical ultrathin NiCo 2 Se 4 nanosheets are synthesized by the selenization of NiCo 2 O 4 porous nanoneedles. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that the intrinsic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity primarily originate from the NiCo 2 Se 4 , whereas the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is related to the NiCoOOH due to the structural reconstruction. The abundant Se and O vacancies introduced by atomically thin nanostructure modulate the electronic structure of NiCo 2 Se 4 and NiCoOOH, thereby improving the intrinsic HER and OER activities, respectively. COMSOL simulation demonstrate the edges of extended nanosheets from the main body significantly promote the charge aggregation, boosting the reduction and oxidation current during HER/OER process. This charge aggregation effect notably exceeds the tip effect for the nanoneedle, highlighting the unique advantage of the hierarchical nanosheet structure. Benefiting from abundant vacancies and unique nanostructure, the hierarchical ultrathin nanosheet simultaneously improve the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrocatalyst. The optimized samples display an overpotential of 92 mV for HER and 214 mV for OER at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , significantly surpassing the performance of currently reported HER/OER catalysts in neutral media.</description>

                Abstract The development of advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional performance at high current densities is pivotal for reducing electric energy consumption in industrial water splitting for hydrogen production. Herein, a flexible one&#8208;step electrodeposition approach is developed to synthesize superhydrophilic 3D flower&#8208;like clusters of Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P nanosheets grown in situ on nickel foam (NF). Introducing Cu into Co&#8211;P causes strong electron interactions, forming an electronic configuration favorable for the adsorption and desorption of intermediates, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity. The as&#8208;deposited Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P/NF display notable bifunctional catalytic activity with low overpotentials of 259 and 65 mV for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Superwetting 3D flower&#8208;like nanostructures are conducive to the penetration of electrolytes and the rapid release of bubbles, enabling the efficient utilization of active sites and the timely release of bubble stress under high current densities. An assembled Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;P/NF(+, &#8722;) electrolyzer achieves an impressive voltage of 1.85 V at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 for water splitting and appreciable stability for over 220 h under simulated industrial conditions. This work offers an attractive strategy for regulating superaerophobic Co&#8211;P electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting, which can contribute to practical applications.</description>

                Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of porous crystalline materials, synthesized by combining organic linkers and secondary building blocks. Their remarkable designs and flexibility facilitate functional linkers and engineering synergies between the metal nodes, making them appropriate platforms for an extensive variety of applications. The high surface area, controllable porosity, and good stability make them promising materials. The oxygen evolution reaction is the important half-cell reaction that plays a key role in energy conversion and storage devices such as water electrolyzers, regenerative fuel cells, and rechargeable metal-air batteries. The main obstacle in the OER is the sluggish kinetics, the four-electron transfer process requires high overpotential for OER. The development of sophisticated electrocatalysts with high activity and stability based on non-noble metal elements remains a great challenge</description>

                Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have obtained widespread attention as next-generation energy storage systems due to their extremely high energy density. However, the high charge overpotential, attributed to the insulating property of Li2O2, significantly limits the energy efficiency and triggers solvent degradation. The high electrochemical activities of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) on the cathode are crucial for alleviating the high charging polarizations and enhancing the lifetime of Li&#8211;O2 batteries, which are also top challenges of state-of-art research. In this review, the scientific challenges and the proposed solutions in the development of cathode catalysts have been summarized. The recent research advancements on the nanoengineering of cathode catalysts for Li&#8211;O2 batteries have been comprehensively discussed, and the perspectives on the structure optimization are presented. Meanwhile, we have elucidated the structure&#8211;performance relationship between the electronic state and performance of the cathode catalysts at the nanoscale level. This review intends to provide guidelines for the design and construction of cathode catalysts in advanced Li&#8211;O2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Revealing Structural Evolution of Nickel Phosphide-Iron Oxide Core&#8211;Shell Nanocatalysts in Alkaline Medium for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Metal phosphide-containing materials have emerged as a potential candidate of nonprecious metal-based catalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While it is known that metal phosphide undergoes structural evolution, considerable debate persists regarding the effects of dynamics on the surface activation and morphological stability of the catalysts. In this study, we synthesize NiPx-FeOx core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts with an amorphous NiPx core designed for enhanced OER activity. Using ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we elucidate the local structural changes as a function of the cyclic voltammetry cycles. Our studies suggest that the presence of corner-sharing octahedra in the FeOx shell improves structural rigidity through interlayer cross-linking, thereby inhibiting the diffusion of OH&#8211;/H2O. Thus, the FeOx shell preserves the amorphous NiPx core from rapid oxidation to Ni3(PO4)2 and Ni(OH)2. On the other hand, the incorporation of Ni from the core into the FeOx shell facilitates absorption of hydroxide ions for OER. As a result, Ni/Fe(OH)x at the surface oxidizes to the active &#947;-(oxy)hydroxide phase under the applied potentials, promoting OER. This intriguing synergistic behavior holds significance as such a synthetic route involving the FeOx shell can be extended to other systems, enabling manipulation of surface adsorption and diffusion of hydroxide ions. These findings also demonstrate that nanomaterials with core&#8211;shell morphologies can be tuned to leverage the strength of each metallic component for improved electrochemical activities.</description>

      <title>NiMo&#8322;S&#8324;-VS&#8322; heterostructure on nickel Foam: A promising electrocatalyst for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118436</link>

                Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is a slow process; therefore, improved kinetics require catalytic active centers and higher charge transfer capacities. In the present study, a novel heterostructure made of nickel molybdenum sulfide and vanadium disulfide supported on nickel foam (NiMo2S4-VS2/NF) substrate is fabricated using a single-step hydrothermal process. The structural, morphological, elemental, and textural properties of the fabricated materials are confirmed via various analytical techniques. Furthermore, at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, the observed overpotentials was approximately 318 mV corresponding to an OER in 1 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte. It also shows a lower Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec with large turnover frequency of 2.56 s&#8722;1. The resulting NiMo2S4-VS2/NF showed enhanced charge transfer properties and frequent integrated active sites. Hence the remarkable activity of this catalyst is significantly influenced by the synergistic effect of these combined features and resulted in an efficient overall water splitting. This was ascribed to NiMo2S4 which increases OER at the anode by providing active sites for oxidizing water molecules. In NiMo2S4, Mo and S elements aid to maintain active sites and accelerate reaction kinetics, while Ni sites operate as electrocatalytic efforts for water oxidation. In general, VS2 promotes hydrogen atom recombination into molecular hydrogen while also encouraging HER at the cathode via hydrogen atom adsorption. In general, NiMo2S4-VS2/NF is a suitable option for water splitting applications due to the close proximity of these two components within the structure of the catalyst, which enables charge transfer and surface reactions and also allow for effective OER. This unique approach for designing the catalyst and engineering the heterointerface is a promising strategy to develop novel and efficient OER catalysts.</description>

                Forced by the problems of severe energy crisis, it is urgent to explore high efficiency sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, particularly for electrolytic water devices and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The efficiency of these two devices is mainly dominated by the half-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is the key for the development of water splitting and rechargeable ZABs. The antiperovskites as a promising family of electrocatalyst with structure flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic properties. Defining the enhancement mechanism toward HER, OER, and ORR is an urgent problem for the application of antiperovskite in the electrocatalysis field. This review brief introduces the fundamentals of HER/OER/ORR and summarizes the recent progress of antiperovskite materials in electrocatalysis field, including the research on structural regulation strategies of catalytic properties and catalytic mechanism. Based on ex situ/in situ characterized of electrocatalytic mechanism, the future challenges of antiperovskite in electrocatalytic mechanism and intrinsic modulation were prospected. The basic frontier issues are aimed in the field of HER/OER/ORR to provide theoretical guidance for the development of efficient and economical multifunctional electrocatalysts for ZAB and water splitting.</description>

                Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), especially those containing nickel (Ni), are increasingly recognized for their potential in photo(-/)electrocatalytic water oxidation due to the abundant availability of Ni, their corrosion resistance, and their minimal toxicity. This review provides a comprehensive examination of Ni-based LDHs in electrocatalytic (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water oxidation processes. The review delves into the operational principles, highlighting similarities and distinctions as well as the benefits and limitations associated with each method of water oxidation. It includes a detailed discussion on the synthesis of monolayer, ultrathin, and bulk Ni-based LDHs, focusing on the merits and drawbacks inherent to each synthesis approach. Regarding the EC oxygen evolution reaction (OER), strategies to improve catalytic performance and insights into the structural evolution of Ni-based LDHs during the electrocatalytic process are summarized. Furthermore, the review extensively covers the advancements in Ni-based LDHs for PEC OER, including an analysis of semiconductors paired with Ni-based LDHs to form photoanodes, with a focus on their enhanced activity, stability, and underlying mechanisms facilitated by LDHs. The review concludes by addressing the challenges and prospects in the development of innovative Ni-based LDH catalysts for practical applications. The comprehensive insights provided in this paper will not only stimulate further research but also engage the scientific community, thus driving the field of photo(-/)electrocatalytic water oxidation forward.</description>

                Electrochemical water-splitting is widely acknowledged as a renewable strategy for hydrogen production, but it is primarily constrained by the sluggish reaction kinetics of the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In our study, we employ a fast room-temperature corrosion engineering strategy for the construction of a sulfur-doped Ni-Fe layered dihydroxide catalyst (S-NiFe LDH). With the assistance of a sulfur source, microsphere morphology with an ultra-thin lamellar surface cross-arrangement can be rapidly grown on the surface of an iron foam substrate, ensuring a substantial electrochemical interface. The composition of Ni species in the catalysts can be regulated by simply adjusting the amount of Ni2+ and reaction time. Functioning as an OER catalyst, the S-NiFe LDH demonstrates high activity and reaction kinetics, featuring a minimal overpotential of 120.0 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 39.5 mV dec&#8722;1 and a notable electrical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of 31.3 mF cm&#8722;2. The remarkable electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to its distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structure and sulfur dopants, which effectively regulate the electrochemical interface and electronic structure of NiFe LDH. This work provides valuable insights for expeditious materials design.</description>

                Abstract Water electrolysis has become an attractive hydrogen production method. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck of water splitting as its four&#8208;electron transfer procedure presents sluggish reaction kinetics. Designing composite catalysts with high performance for efficient OER still remains a huge challenge. Here, the P&#8208;doped cobalt oxide/NiFe layered double hydroxides (P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs) composite catalysts with amorphous/crystalline interfaces are successfully prepared for OER by hydrothermal&#8208;electrodeposition combined method. The results of electrochemical characterizations, operando Raman spectra, and DFT theoretical calculations have demonstrated the electrons in the P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs heterointerfaces are easily transferred from Ni 2+ to Co 3+ because that the amorphous configuration of P&#8208;CoO X can well induce Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Co orbital coupling. The electron transfer of Ni 2+ to the surrounding Fe 3+ and Co 3+ will lead to the unoccupied e g orbitals of Ni 3+ that can promote water dissociation and accelerate * OOH migration to improve OER catalytic performance. The optimized P&#8208;CoO X /NiFe LDHs exhibit superior catalytic performance for OER with a very low overpotential of 265 mV at 300 mA cm &#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability of 500 h with almost no attenuation at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work will provide a new method to design high&#8208;performance NiFe LDHs&#8208;based catalysts for OER.</description>

                Developing low&#8208;cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of vital significance for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we fabricate a heterostructure NiS/Ni(OH)x electrocatalyst (Ni&#8208;S&#8208;n) with regenerative oxygen vacancies via electro&#8208;deposition on nickel foam (NF) followed by a facile NaBH4 reduction. The resulting Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst with appropriate amount of oxygen vacancies (Ovs) exhibits extraordinary activity for alkaline OER with overpotential of 142 mV and 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. This catalyst also shows remarkable durability with 40 h. After the stability test, the excellent OER performance is well recovered by regenerating the surface oxygen vacancies (Ovs) significantly with additional NaBH4 reduction. The Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst still displays good activity even after repeating it three times (180 h). The surface oxygen vacancies act as vital active sites for OER. A mechanism of Ovs species transformation and regeneration based on the Ni&#8208;S&#8208;5 catalyst is proposed, which provides a new direction for exploring ultrastable and efficient OER electrocatalysts with renewable active species.</description>

                Abstract Circumventing the conventional two-electron oxygen reduction pathway remains a great problem in enhancing the efficiency of H 2 O 2 photosynthesis. A promising approach to achieve outstanding photocatalytic activity involves the utilization of redox intermediates. Here, we engineer a polyimide aerogel photocatalyst with photoreductive carbonyl groups for non-sacrificial H 2 O 2 production. Under photoexcitation, carbonyl groups on the photocatalyst surface are reduced, forming an anion radical intermediate. The produced intermediate is oxidized by O 2 to produce H 2 O 2 and subsequently restores the carbonyl group. The high catalytic efficiency is ascribed to a photocatalytic redox cycle mediated by the radical anion, which not only promotes oxygen adsorption but also lowers the energy barrier of O 2 reduction reaction for H 2 O 2 generation. An apparent quantum yield of 14.28% at 420 &#177; 10 nm with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.92% is achieved. Moreover, we demonstrate that a mere 0.5 m 2 self-supported polyimide aerogel exposed to natural sunlight for 6 h yields significant H 2 O 2 production of 34.3 mmol m &#8722;2 .</description>

                Abstract Renewable energy&#8208;driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero&#8208;emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir&#8208;based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure&#8208;performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core&#8208;shell, single&#8208;atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

                In this paper, a series of LaMnO3+&#948; (LMOs) were successfully prepared by adjusting the sintering temperature using the sol-gel method with ABO3-type LMO oxides as the object of study. The results showed that with the increase of sintering temperature, the Oads, oxygen vacancies, and Mn4+ content in the system gradually decreased, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was subsequently weakened. Although the suitable Mn3+/Mn4+ valence ratio (2.15:1) of the LMO700 sample created a strong ferromagnetic double-exchange effect, the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in LMO700 disturbed this effect and weakened its macro magnetism. This paper serves to contribute to the design and development of new magnetic perovskite electrocatalysts.</description>

                Co&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their low price and excellent catalytic performance. Herein, strategies of ion leaching and surface reconstruction to form more catalytic active sites are proposed, and accordingly improving the intrinsic activity of OER catalyst. First, the Co&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)/Ni precursors are synthesized on Ni foam by hydrothermal method. Then, the second hydrothermal reaction is carried out in sodium metavanadate solution, and a highly active V&#8208;doped Co&#8208;MOFs/Ni OER catalyst with particle coating is obtained. The results show that V&#8208;doped Co&#8208;MOFs/Ni in 1 m KOH solution shows excellent performance, that is, low overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , Tafel slope of 56 mV dec &#8722;1 , small charge transfer impedance, large electrochemically active area of 1.71 mF cm &#8722;2 , and good stability. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;atomic emission spectrometry measurements confirm that the V ions play a dominant role in leaching, while the Co ions negligibly contribute to the leaching. This work paves an alternative approach for advancing the synthesis of high&#8208;efficiency nonprecious OER catalysts by such a facile green method.</description>

                High-entropy oxides are a new type of material with significant application potential. However, the lack of a universal HEO preparation method severely limits the property study and application of HEOs. Herein, we report a universal approach of spray pyrolysis for the preparation of various HEOs and study the electrocatalytic performance of HEOs toward the oxygen evolution reaction.

      <title>The Effect of Surface Oxygen Coverage on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction over a CoFeNiCr High-Entropy Alloy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14121058</link>

                Developing cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy applications. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) made from earth-abundant transition metals, thanks to their remarkable stability and electrocatalytic performance, provide a promising alternative to expensive electrocatalysts typically derived from noble metals. While pristine HEA surfaces have been theoretically investigated, and the effect of oxygen coverage on conventional metal electrocatalysts has been examined, the impact of surface oxygen coverage on the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reconstruct the free energy diagram of OER intermediates on CoFeNiCr HEA surfaces with varying oxygen coverages, evaluating their impact on the rate-limiting step and theoretical overpotential. Our findings reveal that increased oxygen coverage weakens the adsorption of HO* and O*, but not HOO*. As a result, the theoretical overpotential for the OER decreases with higher oxygen coverage, and the rate-limiting step shifts from the third oxidation step (HOO* formation) at low coverage to the first oxidation step (HO* formation) at higher coverage.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Highly Active GaN:ZnO Photocatalysts Applicable to Z-Scheme Overall Water Splitting Systems</title>

                The Z-scheme system, integrating an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP) with a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), is an ideal strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), in which the development of an efficient OEP remains a challenge. Herein, the GaN:ZnO photocatalyst was synthesized by an ammonium halide-based process to perform a recorded apparent quantum yield of 30% at 420 nm for oxygen evolution from water. It made the GaN:ZnO a remarkable OEP for the construction of three distinct Z-scheme OWS systems, including an unbiased-photoelectrochemical sheet, direct collision, and redox-ion-mediated electron shuttle. The features and parameters of each Z-scheme system were discussed in relation to water splitting, and the most efficient one was established by employing [Fe(CN)6]3&#8211;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8211; as an electron shuttle and SrTiO3:Rh as an HEP. This work not only provides a methodology for synthesizing an efficient GaN:ZnO photocatalyst but also highlights its great potential as an OEP applicable to constructing various Z-scheme OWS systems.</description>

                In response to the growing demand for clean, green, and sustainable energy sources, the development of cost-effective and durable high-activity overall water splitting electrocatalysts is urgently needed. In this study, the heterogeneous structure formed by the combination of FeCoNiP and FeNi-LDH was homogeneously dispersed onto CuO nanowires generated by in-situ oxidation of copper foam as a substrate using an electrodeposition method. This multilevel structure exhibits excellent bifunctional properties as an electrode material in alkaline solutions, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) only 206 mV and 147 mV overpotentials are needed to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm</description>

      <description>Deepak Ranjan Mishra, Asish Dasmohapatra, Pravati Panda, Priyanka Chandra, CRC Press eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399749233

                This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the burgeoning field of MXene-based electrocatalysts, with a specific focus on their pivotal role in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and empirical evidence, we offer a comprehensive overview of the evolution of both pristine MXenes and hybrid MXenes. Commencing with a succinct synthesis overview, we unravel the intricate relationship between electrocatalytic behavior and essential attributes of MXenes, including their M, X, and T composition, as well as vacancies and morphologies. Additionally, we delve into various strategies aimed at augmenting MXene electrocatalysts, which encompass atom substitution, functionalization, defect engineering, and morphology manipulation. Noteworthy in our discussion is the spotlight on the construction of heterojunctions between MXenes and a diverse array of nanostructures, including metal nanoparticles, oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, and phosphides. This emphasis underscores the significance of synergistic interactions in advancing the performance and versatility of MXene-based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Protective Carbon Shells for Improved Stability of Alkaline Water Oxidation Electrocatalysts</title>

                In recent years, carbon shells have garnered attention as possible protective layers that can be applied to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts to prevent corrosion under alkaline conditions. However, thermodynamic considerations and experimental results indicate that these carbon shells are subject to corrosion themselves, limiting their applicability as protective coatings against oxidation. Herein, the thermodynamics of carbon corrosion are presented with spectrometric, spectroscopic, crystallographic, microscopy, and electrochemical measurements, emphasizing the inevitable degradation of carbon under alkaline OER conditions. Recent work focused on suppressing this carbon corrosion is then discussed alongside future directions for carbon shells in water oxidation research.</description>

                Synthesis of high-entropy oxide (HEO) nanocrystals has focused on increasing the temperature in the entropy term (T(&#916;S)) to overcome the enthalpy term. However, these high temperatures lead to large, polydisperse nanocrystals. In this work, we leverage the low solubility product (Ksp) of metal oxides and optimize the Lewis-acid-catalyzed esterification reaction for equal rate production of the cation monomers to synthesize HEO nanocrystals at low temperatures, producing the smallest (&lt;4 nm) and most monodisperse (&lt;15% size dispersity) HEOs to date. We apply these HEO nanocrystals as electrocatalysts, exhibiting promising activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, with an overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA/cm2.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction is the bottleneck to energy-efficient water-based electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), precious metals have generally been necessary for the stable catalysis of this reaction. In this work, we report that delamination of cobalt tungstate enables high activity and durability through the stabilization of oxide and water-hydroxide networks of the lattice defects in acid. The resulting catalysts achieve lower overpotentials, a current density of 1.8 amperes per square centimeter at 2 volts, and stable operation up to 1 ampere per square centimeter in a PEMWE system at industrial conditions (80&#176;C) at 1.77 volts; a threefold improvement in activity; and stable operation at 1 ampere per square centimeter over the course of 600 hours.</description>

                We studied the influence of the surface and crystal lattice about both H2-oxidation reaction and electronic properties of CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The oxygen evolution phenomena in CeO2 NPs were observed in reducing (hydrogen or vacuum) atmosphere. In the catalytic hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR) of CeO2, nonstoichiometric CeO2 produces active oxygen species which react with H2 to form H2O. The CeO2 NPs showed the main TPR temperature of the lattice oxygen at around 700 &#176;C (slow reaction). A low temperature peak appeared at around 500 &#176;C, which is originated from the surface of CeO2 (fast reaction). The active oxygen formation was characterized by different activation energies which were newly determined as 77&#177;18 kJmol-1 (on surface) and 131&#177;16 kJmol-1 (in lattice) for NPs, respectively. Regarding with the electric current response of CeO2 NP, we found the relatively fast peak-out peak and then the gradual increase at 300 &#176;C under the low oxygen pressure of 5&#215;10-3 Pa (vacuum). These were both related to the fast and slow release of oxygen on the surface and then in the lattice of CeO2 NPs. The comparative TPR and electric current observations revealed the common reduction behavior on surface and in bulk region of CeO2 NPs.</description>

      <description>Youqi Chu, Yuanying Mu, Lingfeng Zou, Fan Wu, Lin Yang, Yitian Feng, Lin Zeng, ChemElectroChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399808202

                Abstract LiNi x Co y Al z O 2 (NCA) and LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 (NCM) have become extensively utilized as cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage applications that necessitate consistent power output over prolonged periods and under varying environmental conditions. A crucial structural degradation issue leading to cycling&#8208;induced deterioration, rapid loss of cell capacity/voltage, and the onset of undesirable thermal runaway events involves the decay of cathode materials enriched in nickel. This contribution offers a comprehensive evaluation of cutting&#8208;edge strategies in engineering and material design to enhance the structural stability of cathode materials and reduce detrimental oxygen evolution reactions. It also provides the most recent discoveries regarding oxygen release phenomena and associated mechanisms contributing to structural breakdown in high&#8208;nickel cathodes. The primary source of oxygen depletion and the ensuing structural deterioration caused are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the kinetic mechanisms responsible for oxygen loss are scrutinized, and measures to mitigate resulting electrochemical degradation are elaborated.

                Comprehensive Summary The electrochemical processes of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a crucial role in various energy storage and conversion systems. However, the inherently slow kinetics of reversible oxygen reactions present an urgent demand for the development of efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. Recently, metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) derivatives have attracted extensive attention in electrocatalysis research due to their unique porous structure, abundant active sites, and tunable structural properties. Especially, the optimization of the electronic structure of active sites in MOF derivatives has been proven as an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity. In this review, we provide an overview of the electronic structure optimization strategies for active sites in MOF derivatives as advanced catalysts in various O&#8212;O bond activation reactions, including the construction of synergistic effects between multiple sites, the development of heterogeneous interfaces, the utilization of metal support interactions, and the precise modulation of organic ligands surrounding catalytic active sites at the atomic level. Furthermore, this review offers theoretical insights into the oxygen activation and catalytic mechanisms of MOF derivatives, as well as the identification of active sites. Finally, the potential challenges and prospects of MOF derivatives in electrocatalysis are discussed. This review contributes to the understanding and advancement of efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in energy systems. Key Scientists</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Leaching of Ni Dopants in IrRu Alloy Electrocatalyst Boosts Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract The commercialization of water&#8208;splitting technology strongly relies on the stable and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER&#8208;OER). In this work, the nickel dopants in IrRu alloyed electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting activity are investigated. The incorporation of nickel dopants induces more oxygen atoms coordinating with Ir/Ru facilitating the formation of *OOH species via nucleophilic attack by H 2 O. Additionally, a fast surface reconstruction is achieved due to the electrochemical dissolution of Ni dopants; as a result, more oxygen species are incorporated, evidenced by in situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, the mass activity for Ni@IrRu is enhanced by threefold than commercial IrO 2 in acidic OER catalysis. Moreover, the nickel dopants balance the hydrogen binding strength; as a result, only 609 mV overpotential is demanded to reach 1 A cm &#8722;2 in acidic HER catalysis. The polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) test indicates only 1.87 V is required to attain 2 A cm &#8722;2 , 160 mV lower than Pt/C&#8208;IrO 2 revealing its potential application in PEMWE.</description>

                Abstract Homogeneous microstructure in lead alloy matrix plays an important role in improving its mechanical and electrochemical properties. In this work, different stirring speed provided during the melt casting of the alloy are tended to obtain lead alloys with different microstructure. The results show that proper stirring speed is beneficial for improving the overall homogeneity of the alloy, however, as the stirring speed is too high, plenty of second phase impurities and defects produced in the lead matrix, which possesses negative effect on the mechanical and electrochemical properties. The most uniform composition and homogeneous microstructure was obtained when the stirring speed is 100 r/min, which is conducive to the decrease of oxygen evolution potential of 30 mV and charge transfer resistance of 22.77%, and the increase of the corrosion resistance of 1.49%, and promote the generation of the uniform and dense PbO2 protective layer.</description>

                Abstract To address the rising demand for H_{2} for fuel cells, hydrogen is produced through water splitting (electrochemically/photoelectrochemically).Although perovskite-structured materials show promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their effectiveness in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a challenge. Consequently, there's a growing demand for bifunctional catalysts exhibiting high electroactivity across a broad pH range. One potential candidate for exploration as a negative electrode in batteries and fuel cells is LaFeO_{3}. With co-substitution of Sr and Ti, La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}O_{3} (LSFT) is formed and explored as an air electrode. In this study, we systematically assess LSFT as a bifunctional catalyst across a broad pH spectrum of electrolytic solutions. LSFT displays increased current densities in both the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) domains, alongside improved stability, notably in neutral conditions. Our investigation incorporates Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to determine surface binding energies and construct a Pourbaix diagram. The results underscore the robustness of LSFT as a perovskite-based bifunctional catalyst, achieving a cycle stability exceeding 600 cycles and a chronopotentiometric stability of 1500 hours with a stable potential of \sim2 V at the current density of 150 mA/cm&#178; in the neutral environment.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress and Challenges in Hybrid Water Electrolysis through Economic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00676</link>

                Water electrolysis is a sustainable method of hydrogen production with low levels of CO2 emissions. However, the problem of high economic costs must be resolved. Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg&#8211;1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.</description>

      <title>Effect of cell sintering temperature on the performance of non-noble metal loaded cerium oxide SOEC anodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2783/1/012050</link>

                Abstract Introducing methane oxidation reaction into the anode of the high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) can reduce the power consumption for water electrolysis. Compared to the traditional conditions of methane oxidation, the methane oxidation catalyst sintered at the SOEC anode, which is closely related to the cell sintering process. This study uses non-noble metals as active sites for methane oxidation, zirconia, and samarium oxides doped ceria as catalyst support and oxygen ion conductors. The effects of anode sintering temperature on the electrochemical performance of SOEC assisted by methane oxidation were investigated. The results indicate that the high-temperature sintering process promotes the performance of the SOEC anode with Ni as the active site, while high temperature harms the performance of the Co-loaded anode. The sintering temperature exhibits a poor effect on the Fe-loaded anode. The Ni exhibits good enhancement of methane oxidation on reducing the electrolysis voltage of SOEC, while Co only exhibits methane oxidation assistance at low-temperature sintering. Differently, Fe has almost no obvious methane oxidation assistance for SOEC, which mainly represents good oxygen evolution performance.</description>

                Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) supported single transition metal (TM) atom (TM1/POM) as an efficient soluble redox mediator for Li&#8211;O2 batteries is comprehensively investigated by first-principles calculations. Among the pristine POM and four kinds of TM1/POM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), Co1/POM not only maintains good structural and thermodynamic stability in oxidized and reduced states but also exhibits promising electro(chemical) catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li&#8211;O2 batteries with the lowest Gibbs free energy barriers. Further investigations demonstrate that the moderate binding strength of Li2-xO2 (x = 0, 1, and 2) intermediates on Co1/POM guarantees favorable Li2O2 formation and decomposition. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the introduced Co single atom as an electron transfer bridge can not only efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of POM but also regulate the bonding/antibonding states around the Fermi level of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox. The solvent effect on the OER catalytic performance and the electronic properties of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox with and without dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are also investigated.</description>

                The development of redox bifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance, low cost, and long lifetimes is essential for achieving clean energy goals. This study proposed an atom capture strategy for anchoring dual single atoms (DSAs) in a zinc&#8211;zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn&#8211;ZIF), followed by calcination under an N2 atmosphere to synthesize ruthenium&#8211;platinum DSAs supported on a nitrogen-doped carbon substrate (RuPt DSAs-NC). Theoretical calculations showed that the degree of Ru 5dxz &#8722; *O 2px orbital hybridization was high when *O was adsorbed at the Ru site, indicating enhanced covalent hybridization of metal sites and oxygen ligands, which benefited the adsorption of intermediate species. The presence of the RuPtN6 active center optimized the absorption&#8211;desorption behavior of intermediates, improving the electrocatalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuPt DSAs-NC exhibited a 0.87 V high half-wave potential and a 268 mV low overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline environment. Furthermore, rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) achieved a peak power density of 171 mW cm&#8722;2. The RuPt DSAs-NC demonstrated long-term cycling for up to 500 h with superior round-trip efficiency. This study provided an effective structural design strategy to construct DSAs active sites for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in High&#8208;Performance Direct Seawater Electrolysis for &#8220;Green&#8221; Hydrogen</title>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting through the electrolyzer is the most promising strategy for hydrogen production. Recently, water electrolysis is mainly based on high&#8208;purity freshwater, which not only consumes a large number of freshwater resources but also improves the overall cost due to the extra water purification system. Hence, direct electrolysis of seawater is more desirable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. As is known, the dominant rate&#8208;determining step of overall water splitting is the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves four&#8208;electron transfer and owns a much larger overpotential than cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction. The large challenge for the design of OER catalysts in the seawater media is the competition reaction between OER and chloride oxidation reaction, which greatly influences energy efficiency. Hence, except for the activity and stability, selectivity is another key point for seawater splitting. Herein, after a brief introduction of two half reactions for water splitting, the latest metal hydr(oxide) electrocatalysts with different crystalline structures are summarized according to the previous reports. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of three common water electrolyzers are compared. Finally, the perspectives of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production are outlined for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying and tuning coordinated water molecules for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation</title>

                Abstract Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated tripodal benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes (CCs), Ni-tPBA0~3, with three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites (OCSs) can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. Specifically, nickel centers with mono-coordinated water undergo the intermolecular oxygen coupling while those with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism (IOM) with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized IOM process appears with the synergy of potential OCSs, enabling fast generation of &#8211;Ni&#8211;(OH)x intermediate and synchronizing the re-coordination of water molecules with the deprotonation of active &#8211;OH for enhanced kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and long-term stability of 150 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 was achieved, superior to most single transition metal-based molecular electrocatalysts. This study underscores the potential of crafting the coordinated water molecules for efficient electrocatalysis applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on the Te/Po doped SrTiO3 (100) surface for photocatalytic overall water splitting to produce hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104645</link>

                The (100) surface of SrTiO3 is inefficient for solar photocatalytic performance because its wide bandgap restricts the response to visible light. The effects of the different surface termination and the doped atoms are investigated to manipulate the solar photocatalytic behavior of the surface. The results reveal that the band edges for the Ti/O-terminated (100) surface of SrTiO3 (SS-I) can straddle the redox potentials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but this is not true for the Sr/O-terminated one (SS-II). However, we successfully make the band edges of SS-II meet the HER and OER conditions by the doped Te and Po atoms (Te-SS-II and Po-SS-II), after trying the doped elements of the IIIA-VIA group. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency are 14.50 %, 9.89 %, and 12.75 % for SS-I, Te-SS-II, and Po-SS-II, respectively. The Gibbs free energies are calculated for each HER and OER. The result of -0.34 eV for the HER on SS-I indicates that this reaction can spontaneously proceed. Therefore, these surfaces are promisingly used for photocatalytic water splitting. The present findings provide helpful guidance to manipulate the photocatalytic water splitting on the (100) surfaces of SrTiO3 by choosing the terminal atoms or doped atoms on the surface.</description>

      <title>Al-O bridged NiFeO /BiVO4 photoanode for exceptional photoelectrochemical water splitting</title>

                Developing BiVO4 photoanode with efficient carrier transfer and fast water oxidation kinetics is the permanent pursuit to achieve the state-of-art solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The capacity to increase the PEC activity of BiVO4 by loading oxygen evolution co-catalysts (OECs) has been proven, however it suffers from sluggish charge carriers dynamics brought on by the complicated interface between BiVO4 and OECs as well as poor long-term durability. Herein, we connected OECs (NiFeOx) and photoanode with a Al-O bridge for bettering the PEC performance of BiVO4. The Al-O bridge served as a channel to extract hole from BiVO4 to NiFeOx, thus boosting charge carriers&#8242; separation and preventing BiVO4 from photo-corrosion. The Al-O bridging photoanode (NiFeOx/Al2O3/BiVO4) demonstrated a high photocurrent density of 5.87 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE and long-term photostability in comparison to NiFeOx/BiVO4 photoanode. This study proposes a unique technique to boost charge carriers&#8242; separation between BiVO4 and OECs for high-efficiency solar-driven PEC water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids is considered a sustainable method to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil. In this study, we assess the effect of monovalent alkali cations (of the acetates) on the performance of Pt electrodes in acid decarboxylation and the competing OER, using various electrochemical methods. We reveal a strong cation dependence generally following the trend Li + &lt;Na + &lt;K + ~Cs + within a large pH range. Using rotating ring disc electrode measurements, we highlight the strong contribution of the oxygen evolution reaction particularly for electrolytes containing Li + and Na + which decreases the selectivity for Kolbe oxidation. In addition, the faradaic efficiency (FE) towards methanol ranges between 16 % (for Li + ) and 29 % (for Cs + ) at high solution pH (9 or 12). The observed trends are generally explained by a cation&#8208;dependent interfacial pH and surface coverage of acetate, both lowest for Li. This is evident from differences in charge transfer resistance determined by impedance measurements and local pH measurements. Additionally, enhanced dissolution of Pt by Li + is also proposed. This work highlights that K + and Cs + cations favor FE for electrochemical Kolbe oxidation, at relatively low current densities.</description>

                The treasure hunting of effective and efficient materials for the renewable hydrogen production through the water splitting process has escalated due to the pressing demand for the clean and sustainable energy sources. In this context, the layered two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenides have become attractive options owing to their special structural and electrical characteristics. In this investigation, the 2D layered copper sulfide (CuS) and copper sulfoselenide (CuSSe) as the electrocatalysts have been carried out for the water splitting applications. The synthesis of CuS and CuSSe nanosheets was achieved by an easy and scalable solvothermal technique, permitting mastery in the fabrication of high-quality 2D layers. The successful formation of 2D layered structure was characterized by using several methods, including the X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further, the electrochemical studies of the CuS and CuSSe were conducted to investigate the water splitting performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The laminar 2D nanostructured ternary CuSSe electrocatalyst exhibited a smaller overpotential of &#8722;270 mV with a Tafel value of 153 mV/dec with three-fold enhancement in response rate compared to the binary sample. The results provided the crucial insights for advancing the development of efficient and sustainable materials, which could be played a key role in enabling the clean hydrogen generation and contribute significantly to the ongoing efforts to establish a hydrogen-based energy system.</description>

                IrO2 is the benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, the high cost and low earth abundance hinder its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, surface&#8208;segregated IrCo nanoparticles on CoO nanosheets with a strong electronic interaction are synthesized through the ion exchange&#8208;pyrolysis method. The resulting IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures, containing an ultra&#8208;low Ir content of 4.73 wt %, demonstrate exceptional performance in the acidic OER. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and remarkable stability, with noticeable activity decay observed only after 140 hours of continuous operation. These results surpass most reported Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Specifically, the mass activity at the overpotential of 300 mV for the IrCo&#8208;CoO catalyst reaches 124.52 mA mgIr&#8208;1, which is 20 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, we constructed a home&#8208;made overall water splitting cell utilizing IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures as both anode and cathode electrodes, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.51 V. Our findings present a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficient catalysts with significantly reduced noble metals loading.</description>

                The reduced phosphomolybdate {P4Mo6X31}n- (X = O or OH) ({P4Mo6}) is an important member of polyoxometalates (POMs) with fully reduced Mo atoms, multiple oxygen coordinate sites, excellent optical response and electrochemical properties which have attracted the extensive interests of researchers. In the past few decades, the development of {P4Mo6}-based POMs has been relatively slow compared with the classical polyoxometalates and most studies mainly focus on the synthesis of novel structures, and some property studies in fluorescent properties, photocatalytic degradation of organic dye and electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Recently, {P4Mo6}-based POMs have received increasing interest due to their unique structure advantages and potential applications in photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, electrochemical sensors, and proton conduction. This review summarizes the development process of {P4Mo6}-based POMs in nearly ten years, mainly involving the structures, synthesis, and applications in diverse fields as well as nanocomposites with {P4Mo6}-based POMs as precursors and their applications. However, there are still some challenges such as improving the scalability of {P4Mo6}-based POMs and intensively studying the relationship between structures and performances. Future research will explore more potential applications in energy storage and conversion such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and battery materials. This review will be helpful for researchers to gain a rapid understanding of this area and value for the future development of {P4Mo6}-based POMs.</description>

      <title>Engineering Durable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers through Suppressed Electrochemical Corrosion of a NiFe&#8211;Graphitic Carbon Shell Anode Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02696</link>
      <description>Young Sang Park, Gwan Hyun Choi, Jiyoon Jung, Cheol&#8208;Hee Ahn, Seung Sang Hwang, Myeong Gyun Nam, Pil J. Yoo, Albert S. Lee, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399812294

                Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                The in situ confinement of nickel (Ni)&#8208;iron (Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer&#8208;derived micro&#8208;/mesoporous silicon carboxynitride (Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N)&#8208;based support is investigated to stimulate superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in an alkaline media. Firstly, we consider a commercial polysilazane (PSZ) and Ni and Fe salts to be mixed together in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in order to prepare a series of Ni&#8208;Fe:organosilicon coordination complexes. The latter are then heat&#8208;treated at 500 &#176;C in flowing argon to form the title compounds. By considering a Ni:Fe ratio of 1.5, face centred cubic (fcc) NixFey alloy NPs with a size of 15&#8208;30 nm are in situ generated in a micro&#8208;/mesoporous Si&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8208;N&#8208;based support displaying a specific surface area (SSA) as high as 237 m2&#8901;g&#8208;1. Hence, NPs are renderedaccessible to promote electrocatalytic water oxidation. An OER overpotential as low as 315 mV at 10 mA&#8901;cm&#8208;2 is measured. This high catalytic performance (considering that the metal mass loading is as low as 0.24 mg cm&#8722;2) is rather stable as observed after an activation step; thus, validating our synthesis approach and opening further investigations. This is clearly attributed to both the strong NP&#8208;matrix interaction and the confinement effect of the matrix as highlighted through post mortem microscopy observations.</description>

      <title>Sulfidation of Iron - Based Nanomaterial as Catalyst for Water Splitting Using Hydrothermal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.59188/jcs.v3i5.728</link>

                Consumption of fossil fuels causes greenhouse effect and global warming, hence the need for renewable energy sources that are environmentally friendly. Hydrogen is one of the abundant elements on earth. Hydrogen refers to a clean and renewable energy source, hydrogen can be a good choice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One way to produce hydrogen is by electrochemical water splitting. This study aims to determine the characterization of iron-based nanomaterials (iron sulfide - iron hydroxide) as a water splitting catalyst in general. Iron sulfide synthesis was carried out using hydrothermal sulfidation method for 6 hours at 80 oC with nickel foam as substrate. Synthesis of iron sulfide varying the concentration of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (0.0125 M, 0.025 M, 0.05 M and 0.1 M) produced brownish yellow to blackish grey colored samples. Characterization results using XRD showed that iron sulfide peaks were detected at higher concentrations of sodium sulfide nonahydrate. Based on the results of analyzing iron hydroxide using SEM, it is known that the sample is in the form of nano walls and on iron sulfide, it is known that the sample is in the form of nanoscale particles. Based on electrochemical measurement results, iron hydroxide can be a good catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with commercial Pt/C. The overpotential of iron hydroxide is smaller than Pt/C, which is only 15 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm2 and iron sulfide can be a good catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with electrocatalytic measurement results close to commercial RuO2. This is indicated by the small overpotential (260 mV at current densisty 10 mA/cm2 and small tafel slope (51 mV/dec).</description>

      <title>Study of the Suitability of Corncob Biochar as Electrocatalyst for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060209</link>

                There has been a recent increasing interest in Zn&#8211;air batteries as an alternative to Li-ion batteries. Zn&#8211;air batteries possess some significant advantages; however, there are still problems to solve, especially related to the tuning of the properties of the air&#8211;cathode which should carry an inexpensive but efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reaction electrocatalyst. Biochar can be an alternative, since it is a material of low cost, it exhibits electric conductivity, and it can be used as support for transition metal ions. Although there is a significant number of publications on biochars, there is a lack of data about biochar from raw biomass rich in hemicellulose, and biochar with a small number of heteroatoms, in order to report the pristine activity of the carbon phase. In this work, activated biochar has been made by using corncobs. The biomass was first dried and minced into small pieces and pyrolyzed. Then, it was mixed with KOH and pyrolyzed for a second time. The final product was characterized by various techniques and its electroactivity as a cathode was determined. Physicochemical characterization revealed that the biochar had a hierarchical pore structure, moderate surface area of 92 m2 g&#8722;1, carbon phase with a relatively low sp2/sp3 ratio close to one, and a limited amount of N and S, but a high number of oxygen groups. The graphitization was not complete while the biochar had an ordered structure and contained significant O species. This biochar was used as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in Zn&#8211;air batteries where it demonstrated a satisfactory performance. More specifically, it reached an open-circuit voltage of about 1.4 V, which was stable over a period of several hours, with a short-circuit current density of 142 mA cm&#8722;2 and a maximum power density of 55 mW cm&#8722;2. Charge&#8211;discharge cycling of the battery was achieved between 1.2 and 2.1 V for a constant current of 10 mA. These data show that corncob biochar demonstrated good performance as an electrocatalyst in Zn&#8211;air batteries, despite its low specific surface and low sp2/sp3 ratio, owing to its rich oxygen sites, thus showing that electrocatalysis is a complex phenomenon and can be served by biochars of various origins.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Ions Synergistic Bilayer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Pillared MXene Directing In Situ Ordered Embedding Growth of Highly Efficient NiFe Alloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202408303</link>

                Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi&#8208;directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano&#8208;hybrid material (NiFe/MX&#8208;HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX&#8208;HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene&#8208;based heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Electrochemical Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural on a Thin-Film Ni Anode</title>

                The electrochemical oxidation of alcohols is being explored as a favorable substitute for the oxygen evolution reaction owing to its capability to generate high-value products and lower overpotentials. Herein, we present a systematic investigation into the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a model biomass platform chemical, on a thin-film nickel catalyst, aiming to investigate the underlying reaction mechanism and shed light on the role of the catalyst's microenvironment and phase on activity and product selectivity. Utilizing a combined experimental and computational approach, we demonstrate that NiOOH is the active phase for HMF oxidation. Additionally, we find a substantial impact of the electrochemical environment, particularly the electrolyte pH, on the reaction. Under highly alkaline conditions (pH = 13), higher activity for HMF oxidation is observed, accompanied by an increased selectivity toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) production. Conversely, a less alkaline environment (pH = 11) results in diminished HMF oxidation activity and a higher preference for the partial oxidation product 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF). Mechanistic insights from DFT studies reveal that geminal diols that are present under highly alkaline conditions undergo hydride transfer via HMFCA, while a shift to an alkoxide route occurs at a lower pH, favoring the DFF pathway. Hydride transfer energetics are also strongly affected by the surface Ni oxidation state. This integrated approach, bridging experimental and computational insights, provides a general framework for investigating the electrochemical oxidation of aldehydes and alcohols, thereby advancing rational design strategies in electrocatalysts for alcohol electro-oxidation reactions.</description>

      <title>Innovative Insights into Water-Oxidation Mechanism: Investigating Birnessite&#8217;s Reaction with Cerium(IV) Ammonium Nitrate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c01461</link>

                Developing Mn-based water-oxidation reaction (WOR) catalysts is key for renewable energy storage, utilizing Mn's abundance, cost-effectiveness, and natural role. Cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) has been widely utilized as a sacrificial oxidant in the exploration of WOR catalysts. In this study, advanced techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), to delve into the WOR facilitated by CAN and birnessite were employed. XANES analysis has demonstrated that the average oxidation states (AOSs) of Mn in birnessite, a birnessite/CAN mixture, and in the birnessite/CAN mixture postwater addition are 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, respectively. In situ Raman spectroscopy performed in the presence of birnessite and CAN revealed a distinct peak at 784 cm&#8211;1, which is attributed to Mn(IV)&#9552;O. A shift of this peak to 769 cm&#8211;1 in H218O confirms its association with Mn(IV)&#9552;O. No change in this peak was observed in D2O, further supporting the notion that it is linked to Mn(IV)&#9552;O rather than Mn&#8211;OH (D). Furthermore, EPR spectroscopy shows the presence of Mn(IV). It is suggested that the WOR mechanism initiates with the oxidation of birnessite by CAN, which enhances the concentration of Mn(IV) sites in the birnessite structure. Under acidic conditions, birnessite, enriched in Mn(IV), facilitates oxygen evolution and subsequently transitions into a form with reduced Mn(IV) levels. This process highlights the critical function of the Mn (hydr)oxide structure, similar to its role in the water-oxidizing complex of Photosystem II, where it serves as charge storage for oxidizing equivalents from CAN, paving the way for a four-electron reaction that drives the WOR.</description>

                Oxygenic photosynthesis is responsible for nearly all biomass production on Earth, and may have been a prerequisite for the evolution of multicellular life. Life has evolved to perform photosynthesis under a wide range of illumination conditions, but with a common basic architecture of a light-harvesting antenna system coupled to a photochemical reaction centre. Using a general thermodynamic model of energy capture and diffusion in the antennae, coupled with a genetic algorithm to model their evolution, we reproduce qualitatively the antenna structures of multiple types of oxygenic photoautotrophs, including pigment composition, the linear absorption profile and the macrostructural topology, suggesting that the same simple physical principles underlie the development of distinct light-harvesting structures in various photosynthetic organisms. We finally apply our model to extra-solar light-environments and comment on the relative viability of both oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis on exoplanets orbiting other types of stars.</description>

                Abstract This chapter examines how networks of cooperating and competing species can reach a flexible stability, simultaneously remaining stable while retaining the ability to evolve in many directions. Cooperation among species alone cannot explain this, because such cooperation can only evolve if it makes the participating species, acting as a unit, better overall competitors in the larger ecosystem. We explore how these continually shifting cooperative and competitive interactions can result in a flexible, rather than an ossified, stable state. Remarkable new adaptations are free to appear, along with avenues for other members of the ecosystems to adapt to them. Such ecosystem flexibility explains the history of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. This system, on which almost all of Earth&#8217;s life now depends, began its evolution as types of more-limited anoxygenic photosynthesis in two bacterial lineages. Gene transfers brought these photosynthetic mechanisms together in a third bacterial lineage. There, they evolved cooperative interactions that allowed them to use carbon dioxide and water to generate chemical energy and release gaseous oxygen as a &#8220;waste&#8221; product. This did not result in the immediate death of all anaerobic organisms that were sensitive to oxygen, however. We explore why, in spite of the overwhelming advantage of oxygenic photosynthesis, it took two billion years for oxygenic photosynthetic organisms to fully take over the planet. This was because ecosystems still had many routes by which their species could adapt to this new selective factor, slowing its advance and increasing life&#8217;s complexity and flexibility at the same time.</description>

      <title>Structure and Reactivity of Active Oxygen Species on Silver Surfaces for Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01566</link>

                The epoxidation of ethylene stands as one of the most important industrial catalytic reactions, and silver-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity. Oxygen is activated on the surface of silver during the reaction and exerts a substantial impact on product selectivity. Notably, the oxygen species residing in the topmost atomic layers profoundly influence the reactivity of a catalyst. However, their characterization under in situ reaction conditions remains a huge challenge, and specific structures have not been identified yet. In this study, we employ in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to determine the oxygen species formed at the topmost atomic layers of a silver foil and to assign them a structure. Three different groups of oxygen species activated on silver are identified: (i) surface lattice oxygen and two oxygen species originating from associatively adsorbed dioxygen and (ii) top and (iii) subsurface oxygen. Transient in situ photoelectron spectroscopy experiments are carried out to reveal the dynamic evolution and thus reactivity of the different oxygen species under ethylene epoxidation reaction environments. The top oxygen atom from the adsorbed associated dioxygen is the most active. Meanwhile, a frequency-selective data analysis method, developed to process time-resolved data, provides insights into the evolving trends of peak intensities for different oxygen species. The versatility of this method suggests its potential application in future time-resolved characterization studies.</description>

                Rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes affects the performance of a semiconductor device and limits the efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production. The use of an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers is a feasible approach to achieve high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Therefore, we synthesized a three-dimensional S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4) and investigated its activity in photocatalytic water splitting. An analysis of the band structure (XPS, UPS, and Mott&#8211;Schottky) indicated effective interfacial charge transfer in an S-scheme nanoscale heterojunction composed of two n-type semiconductors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirmed that the light-induced charge transfer followed the S-scheme mechanism. Based on the capture test (EPR) of &#8226;OH free radicals, it can be seen that the enhanced activity is attributed to the S-scheme carrier migration mechanism in heterojunction, which promotes the rapid adsorption of H+ by the abundant amino sites in g-C3N4, thus effectively generating H2. The 2D/2D LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4 heterojunction has a good interface and produces a built-in electric field, improving the separation of e&#8211; and h+ while increasing the oxygen vacancy. The synergistic effect of the heterostructure and oxygen vacancy makes the photocatalyst significantly better than LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3 and g-C3N4 in visible light. The hydrogen evolution rate of the composite catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) was 34.50 mmol&#183;h&#8211;1&#183;g&#8211;1, which was 40.6 times and 9.2 times higher than that of the catalysts (LaNiO3 and g-C3N4), respectively. After 25 h of cyclic testing, the catalyst (LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3/g-C3N4-70 wt %) composite material still exhibited excellent hydrogen evolution performance and photostability. It was confirmed that the synergistic effect between abundant active sites, enriched oxygen vacancies, and 2D/2D heterojunctions improved the photoinduced carrier separation and the light absorption efficiency of visible light. This study opens up new possibilities for the logical design of efficient photodecomposition using 2D/2D heterojunctions combined with oxygen vacancies.</description>

                Prebiotic pre-Darwinian reactions continued throughout biochemical or Darwinian evolution. Early chemical processes could have occurred on Earth between 4.5 and 3.6 billion years ago when cellular life was about to come into being. Pre-Darwinian evolution assumes the development of hereditary elements but does not regard them as self-organizing processes. The presence of biochemical self-organization after the pre-Darwinian evolution did not justify distinguishing between different types of evolution. From the many possible solutions, evolution selected from among those stable reactions that led to catalytic networks, and under gradually changing external conditions produced a reproducible, yet constantly evolving and adaptable, living system. Major abiotic factors included sunlight, precipitation, air, minerals, soil and the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere. Abiotic sources of chemicals contributed to the formation of prebiotic RNA, the development of genetic RNA, the RNA World and the initial life forms on Earth and the transition of genRNA to the DNA Empire, and eventually to the multitude of life forms today. The transition from the RNA World to the DNA Empire generated new processes such as oxygenic photosynthesis and the hierarchical arrangement of processes involved in the transfer of genetic information. The objective of this work is to unite earlier work dealing with the formose, the origin and synthesis of ribose and RNA reactions that were published as a series of independent reactions. These reactions are now regarded as the first metabolic pathway.</description>

      <title>Restructuring of Palladium Nanoparticles during Oxidation by Molecular Oxygen</title>

                An interplay between Pd and PdO and their spatial distribution inside the particles are relevant for numerous catalytic reactions. Using in situ time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) supported by theoretical simulations, a mechanistic picture of the structural evolution of 2.3 nm palladium nanoparticles upon their exposure to molecular oxygen is provided. XAS analysis revealed the restructuring of the fcc-like palladium surface into the 4-coordinated structure of palladium oxide upon absorption of oxygen from the gas phase and formation of core@shell Pd@PdO structures. The reconstruction starts from the low-coordinated sites at the edges of palladium nanoparticles. Formation of the PdO shell does not affect the average Pd&#8210;Pd coordination numbers, since the decrease of the size of the metallic core is compensated by a more spherical shape of the oxidized nanoparticles due to a weaker interaction with the support. The metallic core is preserved below 200 &#176;C even after continuous exposure to oxygen, with its size decreasing insignificantly upon increasing the temperature, while above 200 &#176;C, bulk oxidation proceeds. The Pd&#8210;Pd distances in the metallic phase progressively decrease upon increasing the fraction of the Pd oxide due to the alignment of the cell parameters of the two phases.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is commonly regarded as a sustainable and clean method to generate hydrogen and oxygen, which is deemed to be efficient for the utilization of renewable energy. Electrocatalysts are essential components to enhance electrochemical efficiency and optimize product yield. Hollow micro/nanostructures possess large specific surface areas, multiple voids, and tunable chemical compositions, making them suitable for use as direct catalysts or as supports for electrochemical reactions. This review summarizes recent advancements in structural and functional designs of micro/nanostructured hollow materials as electrocatalysts for an enhanced water-splitting process. We emphasize ideas and strategies to create various hollow electrocatalysts for oxygen/hydrogen evolution processes. Subsequently, a comprehensive summary of recent studies on hollow borides, carbides, oxides, phosphides, selenides, sulfides, alloys, MXenes, and various heterostructured electrocatalysts containing hollow hosts is provided. Furthermore, we highlight the current challenges and perspectives of hollow micro/nanostructures for electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Seawater oxygen isotopes as a tool for monitoring future meltwater from the Antarctic ice-sheet</title>

                Abstract To reduce uncertainties in future sea level projections, it is necessary to closely monitor the evolution of the Antarctic ice-sheet. Here, we show that seawater oxygen isotopes are an effective tool to monitor ice-sheet freshwater discharge and its contributions to sea level rise. Using the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model with imposed estimates of future meltwater fluxes, we find that the anthropogenic ice-sheet signal in water isotopes emerges above natural variability decades earlier than salinity-based estimates. The superiority of seawater isotopes over salinity in detecting the ice-sheet melting can be attributed to the higher signal-to-noise ratio of the former and the fact that future sea ice changes only contribute little to seawater isotopes but a lot to salinity. We conclude that in particular in the Ross Sea sector, continuous seawater oxygen isotope measurements could serve as an early warning system for rapid anthropogenic Antarctic ice-sheet mass loss.</description>

      <title>Fast Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation by Singlet Oxygen-Engaged Sequential Excitation Energy and Electron-Transfer Process</title>

                Sequential excitation energy and electron transfer (ET) are ubiquitous pathways for converting solar energy to chemical energy in photosynthesis. Mimicking this unique process for chemical synthesis is promising yet still a big challenge. Herein, taking photosynthesis as an inspiration, we demonstrate an interesting pathway for oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important and valuable commodity chemical. The proposed route was verified on a biomimetic photocatalyst, i.e., an aluminum porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheet (Al&#8211;TCPP). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the dioxygen molecule is first converted to a highly active singlet oxygen intermediate through an excitation energy transfer (EET) and then reduced to H2O2 via the photogenerated electrons with a reduced barrier over Al&#8211;TCPP. Consequently, Al&#8211;TCPP shows a 32 times higher H2O2 evolution rate than that of the pristine TCPP counterpart, wherein excitation energy transfer mainly exists. This study presents a paradigm to mimic the photosynthetic sequential excitation energy and electron-transfer process for improved synthesis of valuable commodity chemicals.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Plasma Oxidation of Ag Nanofilms: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>

                Plasma oxidation of metals has been studied extensively to fabricate nanoporous oxides with the merits of room temperature treatment and facile control of the oxidation rate. Plasma oxidation of Ag, motivated by studies on atomic oxygen corrosion of Ag, is one of the most studied systems. However, several important questions remain unaddressed and even overlooked traditionally: the critical role played by atomic O in promoting oxidation, evolution of microstructures during plasma exposure, and a sound framework for quantitative oxidation kinetic analyses. In this paper, the O2 plasma oxidation behavior of Ag films deposited on Si substrates was systematically studied both experimentally and theoretically. The effects of plasma pressure and power on the microstructural evolution and oxidation kinetics of Ag films of various thicknesses were investigated using comprehensive characterization, as well as numerical analysis of plasma chemistry for deriving atomic O concentration. The findings here provide a full picture and deep mechanistic insights into the morphology and microstructure evolution of Ag films and the growth of dense or porous Ag2O and AgO oxide layers by plasma oxidation, revealing the intricate interplay between atomic O, vacancy creation, Ag ion diffusion, Kirkendall effect, formation of pores, and interfacial void coalescence. The methodology developed here can be easily transferred to help understand the plasma oxidation behavior of other metals.</description>

                Abstract Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li 2 O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which could show fast Li + diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and non&#8208;uniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li 2 O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, we successfully prepared CoO x embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoO x ) as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18 O isotope labeling, we aimed to elucidate the role of CoO x during SEI evolution that CoO x contributes significantly to Li 2 O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li 2 O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li + migration kinetics, and therefore the CNF&#8208;CoO x @Li anode could exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

      <title>Stable isotope revealed hydroclimate transition and topography growth in the Northern Tibetan Plateau at ~ 10 Ma</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112341</link>

                The Middle to Late Miocene uplift of the northern Tibetan Plateau had been revealed in a large amount of studies, however, its effects on hydrological and climatic evolution in Asia remains unclear due to the lack of well dated direct hydrological records in this region. Here, we report a carbonate oxygen isotope record (&#948;18Oc) from the western Qaidam Basin, and compare it with the &#948;18Oc records of five different basins in the Northern Tibetan Plateau. These data reconstruct the hydroclimatic evolution in this region and show a divergence of &#948;18Oc variation pattern in different basins at &#8764;11.5&#8211;8.5 Ma, which is different with a consistent evolution pattern of them before and after this time interval. This divergence is characterized by a significant decrease of &#948;18Oc in the windward locations while an increase in the leeward locations. This &#948;18Oc divergence was decoupling with the concurrent stable global climate, but consistent with the contemporaneous uplift of the northern Tibetan plateau. This suggests a possible link between &#948;18Oc divergence and topographic growth, which is further supported by a &#8764; 1000 m paleoelevation increase revealed by our &#948;18Oc paleoelevation reconstruction. We suggest that the topography growth of the northern Tibetan Plateau especially the surrounding mountains would have facilitated water vapor transport to the windward regions, resulting in isotopic depletion in the water vapor masses. Whilst, a blocking of water vapor masses would induce aridity and increased evaporation in the leeward slopes, thus enriching heavy isotopes in precipitation there. This study corroborates the extensive uplift of the Northern Tibetan Plateau during &#8764;11.5&#8211;8.5 Ma from an isotopic perspective. A comparison of the obtained &#948;18Oc records with modern ones further suggests an establishment of modern hydroclimatic patterns in northern Tibetan Plateau at &#8764;8.5 Ma.</description>

      <title>Oxygen and sulfur stable isotope ratios of Late Devonian vertebrates trace the relative salinity of their aquatic environments</title>

                Late Devonian aquatic environments hosted the fin-to-limb transition in vertebrates. Upper Devonian (ca. 365&#8722;360 Ma) strata in Pennsylvania, USA, preserve a diversity of fishes and tetrapods in coastal marine to fluvial depositional environments, making this region ideal for investigating the ecology and evolution of Late Devonian vertebrates. A key unresolved issue has been reconstructing the specific aquatic habitats that hosted various vertebrates during this period. Specifically, the salinity of environments spanning fresh to shallow marine water is difficult to discern from sedimentological and paleontological analyses alone. Here, we analyze rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) as well as stable oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (&#948;18O, &#948;34S) in fossil vertebrate bioapatite from late Famennian (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma) strata of the Catskill and Lock Haven formations in the Appalachian Basin, USA, to determine the relative salinity of their aquatic environments. These results confirm the ecological euryhalinity of several taxa (Bothriolepis sp., tristichopterids, and Holoptychius sp.). Our results are the first demonstrating that some early tetrapod species occupied unequivocally freshwater habitats by late Famennian time (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma). Our study shows that integrating sedimentological and paleontological data with combined oxygen and sulfur isotope analysis allows precise tracing of the relative salinity of vertebrate habitats deep in the past.</description>

                This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide iceline within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO iceline is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5-1 times their protosolar ratios. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.</description>

                Abstract. The study of isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen in fossilized air trapped in ice core bubbles provides information on variations in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes and productivity in the past. However, to refine these interpretations, it is necessary to better quantify fractionation of oxygen in the biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. We set up a system of closed biological chambers in which we studied the evolution of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 due to biological processes. To easily replicate experiments, we developed a multiplexing system which we describe here. We compared measurements of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 using two different measurement techniques: optical spectrometry (Optical-Feedback Cavity- Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy, i.e. OF-CEAS technique), which enables higher temporal resolution and continuous data collection and isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with a flanged air recovery system, thus validating the data analysis conducted through the OF-CEAS technique. As a first application, we investigated isotopic discrimination during respiration and photosynthesis. We conducted a 5-day experiment using maize (Zea mays L.) as model species. The 18O discrimination value for maize during dark plant respiration was determined as - 17.8 &#177; 0.9 &#8240; by IRMS and - 16.1 &#177; 1.1 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. We also found a value attributed to the isotopic discrimination of terrestrial photosynthesis equal to + 3.2 &#177; 2.6 &#8240; by IRMS and + 6.7 &#177; 3.8 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. These findings were consistent with a previous study by Paul et al. (2023).</description>

                We present here initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau. During our monitoring period, XZ Tau exhibited several episodes of brightness variations in timescales of months at optical wavelengths in contrast to the mid-infrared wavelengths. The color evolution of XZ Tau during this period suggests that the brightness variations are driven by changes in accretion from the disc. The mid-infrared light curve shows an overall decline in brightness by &#8764; 0.5 and 0.7 magnitude respectively in WISE W1 (3.4 &#956;m) and W2 (4.6 &#956;m) bands. The emission profile of the hydrogen recombination lines along with that of Ca II IRT lines points towards magnetospheric accretion of XZ Tau. We have detected P Cygni profile in H&#946; indicating of out-flowing winds from regions close to accretion. Forbidden transitions of oxygen are also detected, likely indicating jets originating around the central pre-main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Detached eddy simulation of the interaction between acoustics and flame dynamics during the transition before and after longitudinal thermoacoustic instability in a multi-element liquid rocket engine</title>

                In this study, we present the first numerical evidence of multiple bifurcation processes occurring in a multi-element model liquid rocket engine before and after the longitudinal thermoacoustic instability regime, as we vary the oxidizer inlet temperature within the range of 400&#8211;1400 K. To accurately capture the non-premixed turbulent combustion process, a comprehensive three-dimensional compressible detached eddy algorithm was employed, incorporating a two-step methane/oxygen chemical reaction kinetic mechanism based on OpenFOAM. After validating the numerical framework and achieving grid independence, we focus on (1) investigating the transition routes of system dynamics and (2) analyzing the spatiotemporal evolution of multiple jet combustion flow fields during the multi-bifurcation process. Our results indicate that the system dynamics undergoes two successive bifurcating processes. During the first bifurcation (400 K &#8804; T &#8804; 800 K), the system dynamics transitions into a full period-1 oscillation through intermittency. In the second bifurcation (1200 K &#8804; T &#8804; 1400 K), the system shifts from a limit cycle state back to a combustion noise state. The complex coupling mechanism between injectors is further elucidated through frequency spectrum results of radial velocity and temperature near the initial shear layer in the wakes of different injectors, especially the symmetry-breaking response between different injector jets. The analysis of snapshots and flame index also reveals the spatiotemporal evolution of combustion flow fields, specifically highlighting vortex dynamics, heat release, and combustion modes that potentially contribute to thermoacoustic instability.</description>

      <title>Yeast adapts to diverse ecological niches driven by genomics and metabolic reprogramming</title>

                The widely used model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is ubiquitously present in a variety of natural and human-associated habitats. Despite extensive studies of this organism, the metabolic mechanisms driving its adaptation to varying niches remain elusive. We here leveraged the genome sequences of 1,807 S. cerevisiae strains for creating a high-quality pan-genome, which facilitates the comprehensive characterization of the genetic diversity among species. Utilizing the pan-genome to infer strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (ssGEMs), enables quantitative predictions of physiological phenotypes and examining the metabolic disparities among all the S. cerevisiae strains. We further performed integrative analyses of fluxomic and transcriptomics, as well as constrained 907 ssGEMs by transcriptome data, which revealed the significant transcriptional regulation in the metabolism of certain amino acids at the population level. Additionally, comparing all 907 refined ssGEMs showed that S. cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches had undergone reductive evolution at both the genomic and metabolic network levels, as opposed to wild isolates. Finally, multidimensional integrative analyses of the pan-genome, transcriptome, and metabolic fluxome revealed marked metabolic differences among S. cerevisiae strains originating from distinct oxygen-limited niches, such as human gut and cheese environments, and identified convergent metabolic evolution, such as downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Collectively, our study develops large-scale strain-specific genome-scale models at the population level, presenting unprecedented opportunities for understanding yeast adaptive evolutionary mechanisms and yeast physiology research.</description>

                Temperature is the most important abiotic factor and has a direct influence on the physiology of the organism, affecting nearly all other parameters of the living environment of organisms. Ectothermic organisms are highly endangered in the current crisis climate, as they are unable to use metabolic heat to maintain body temperature. Reptiles are ectothermic vertebrates that are also susceptible to temperature fluctuations. Metabolism, muscle and nervous system function and reproduction are closely linked to reptile body temperature. To study the effects of temperature on oxidative stress, it is necessary to describe the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and how organisms can prevent oxidative stress. This article describes the oxidation-antioxidation processes and the oxidative stress caused by thermal effects in reptiles. In the metabolic processes of aerobic organisms, ROS are continuously generated as by-products of oxidation-reduction reactions and are not primarily harmful. Furthermore, ROS are essential for many physiological functions, e.g., for energy production and for processes in the immune system. The potential toxicity of reactive oxygen radicals under physiological conditions is prevented by the antioxidant defence system. Oxidativestress occurs when the balance between oxidation and antioxidation systems is disturbed by excessive amounts of ROS or by the depletion of antioxidants. It is known that the metabolic rate of reptiles correlates with environmental temperature, making them physiologically more sensitive to temperature fluctuations compared to mammals. However, it must be considered that ectothermic organisms have evolved many thermal adaptations through physiological and behavioural measures to mitigate the resulting oxidative stress. However, further research in the fields of ecology, biogeography and evolution is needed to determine the exact effects of temperature on oxidative stress and the resulting changes in life characteristics in wild populations.</description>

      <title>Stability and Redox Mechanisms of Ni-Rich NMC Cathodes: Insights from First-Principles Many-Body Calculations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c00928</link>

                Ni-rich LiNiaMnbCocO2 (NMC) cathodes undergo a series of degradation reactions, a prominent one being oxygen loss from the surface of the NMC particles; this process is more pronounced as Ni content is increased and at high voltages. Our first-principles study examines the redox behavior of transition metals (TMs) and O in Ni-rich NMC cathodes as a function of (de)lithiation. We use ab initio multiple scattering, density-functional theory (DFT)-based core-loss spectroscopy, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to give a many-body treatment of both dynamic and static correlations. Despite Ni, Mn, and Co K-edges calculated using ab initio multiple scattering based on Green's functions showing an excellent match with experimentally obtained X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES), we demonstrate that the ionic model of ascribing shifts in the XANES spectra to changes in metal oxidation states is inappropriate. We show that in these cases, which are characterized by strong covalency between the TM and oxygen, DMFT calculations based on Wannier projections are to date to the best of our knowledge the most accurate as well as computationally accessible method to calculate charges and hence assign oxidation states accurately. Due to the corresponding charge transfer from O p to Ni d, a ligand hole forms on O in Ni-rich regions. The individual Ni charge remains fairly constant throughout the charging/discharging process, particularly in Ni-rich environments in the material. In contrast, O has dual redox behavior, showing greater involvement in redox in Ni-rich regions while showing negligible redox involvement in Ni-poor regions. The Ni&#8211;O covalent system starts participating in redox around a state of delithiation of &#8764;17%, which represents, in our system, the beginning of the charge. Contrary to previous DFT calculations, we show that Co oxidation does not occur at the very end of charge but rather starts at an earlier state of delithiation of &#8764;67%. The dual behavior of O in terms of participation in the redox process helps explain the overall higher relative stability of lower Ni content NMCs compared to Ni-rich NMCs or LiNiO2 in terms of O loss and evolution of singlet oxygen.</description>

                Abstract We use variable temperature and magnetic field total x-ray scattering to study the crystal structure in the strongly correlated Pr 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3 perovskite, which is a paramagnetic insulator (PMI) at room temperature, becomes a ferromagnetic metal (FMM) at 272 K and, upon further decreasing the temperature, turns into an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI) at 105 K. We find that a model featuring a monoclinic symmetry captures the structure and its temperature and field evolution well, eliminating the need to evoke a phase segregation scenario as done in prior studies. It appears that coupled deviations in Mn-oxygen bonding distances and angles from their values in an undistorted perovskite lattice, i.e., coupled local lattice distortions, drive the phase transitions in Pr 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3 , endowing it with unique physical properties. Local structural distortions thus emerge as an important degree of freedom in strongly correlated systems, in particular perovskite manganates, and, therefore, they should be fully accounted for when their fascinating physics is considered.</description>

                Metal oxide has been considered as promising support to regulate the active microenvironment of noble metals to promote the catalytic performance, but they suffer from unsatisfactory electrical resistance and poor stability. Herein, ultrafast quasi-solid microwave (60 s) is employed to achieve phosphorous-doped black TiO2 supported Ru (Ru/P-TiO2) with d-band center modulation to optimize the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-synthesized Ru/P-TiO2 exhibits extraordinary HER activities in alkaline fresehwater/seawater electrolytes with overpotential of 43 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 coupled with satisfactory stability. Experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculation clarify that the achieved Ru/P-TiO2 owns optimal d-band center for H* adsorption. Moreover, the phosphorous doping enhanced the electronic interactions between Ru and oxygen vacancy-enriched TiO2 to optimize the reaction kinetics and enhance the stability. This work provides promising strategy to modulate the metal oxide matrix for designing novel catalysts on energy conversion and storage applications.</description>

                New N,O-hybrid ligands with methylene fragment between coordinating nitrogen and oxygen donor centers namely, dialkyl(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxides and dialkyl(quinoline-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxides were synthesized. During complexation with MnCl2 pyridyl-containing dialkylphosphine oxides act as chelating N,O-bidentate ligands, while quinoline-containing dialkylphosphine oxide acts as O-monodentate ligand. All compounds were structurally characterized by mass-spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, the monocrystal and powder X-ray analyses. The photoluminescence, electrochemical properties and cytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds were studied. It was found that obtained ligands and their manganese(II) complexes exhibit green&#8211;blue and blue-violet luminescence. High catalytic activity of manganese(II) complex with diisopropyl(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)phosphine oxide in HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) was found. Manganese(II) complexes based on pyridyl-containing phosphine oxides demonstrate high cytotoxic activity towards HuTu80 cancer cell line.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation II. Chemical abundances of carbon,
  nitrogen, and oxygen for 181 planet-host FGK dwarf stars</title>

                One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.</description>

                We present a study of three highly non-radial solar wind events in which the azimuthal solar wind flow angle exceeds 6&#176; for one day or more. None of the events are associated with coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions observed at 1 AU. For all events, the solar wind outflows at 1 AU exhibit low velocity and density. Based on the significant increase in the oxygen charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ at 1 AU for all of the events, we have traced them back to the Sun and found that their source regions originated in active region and coronal hole (AR-CH) pairs mainly located at the central meridian. Furthermore, examining the dynamical evolutions in their source regions using both the Extreme ultra-violet Imaging Telescope and the Michelson Doppler Imager, we found that the changes taking place in AR-CH boundaries eventually disturbed the stable CH configurations, resulting in a reduction of the CH area and finally its disappearance, leaving only with the AR. Our study provides a possible explanation for discussing the origin of the prolonged and highly non-radial solar wind flows.</description>

      <title>Coupled modeling of thermal-fluid-solid and chemo-mechanical behaviors in thermal barrier coatings under flowing gas environment</title>

                This study proposes a modeling approach to simulate the thermo-chemo-mechanical responses of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) exposed to flowing high-temperature gas. A thermal-fluid-solid analysis was performed to simulate temperature fields of the coatings under flowing gas environment, while finite element analysis was carried out to study the oxidation and stress evolutions of the coatings using a developed chemo-mechanical constitutive model. Thermal loads from thermal-fluid-solid analysis were imposed on the finite element model, by which the factors associated with flowing gas were incorporated into the thermo-chemo-mechanical modeling. The study systematically investigated the effects of flowing gas and coolant on the chemo-mechanical responses of the coatings. The results revealed that the enhanced gas factors (temperature, velocity, angle of attack, and pressure) and coolant temperatures accelerate oxidation and induce higher residual stresses, while higher coolant velocity mitigates both oxidation and stresses. The volume fraction of oxygen in the gas was found to have a negligible influence. Dimensional analysis and multiple regression were performed to derive mathematical expressions for assessing out-of-plane stress and oxidation dynamics. Design maps were proposed to guide the durable design of the coatings.</description>

We present a version of the mixing length theory that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally driven and compositionally driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally driven convection in a thermally stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, at the onset of crystallization, the composition flux is large enough to drive fast overturning convection for a short time (&#8764;10 Myr). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation</title>

                Hydrogenation is the process by which the universe's smallest and most abundant element, Hydrogen, passivates recombination active defects. Some form of hydrogenation is used in almost every solar cell ever made and in all record silicon cells. This chapter reviews the evolution of hydrogenation techniques and their pivotal role in solar cell technology. The fundamental properties of hydrogen are considered before a discussion of typical hydrogenation methods including forming gas anneals, "alneal" and hydrogen containing dielectrics with thermal activation. Such methods can provide very effective passivation of silicon surfaces and most grain boundaries. In more recent years, techniques to control the charge state of hydrogen have enabled greatly enhanced passivation of bulk defects such as boron-oxygen complexes. Known as "advanced hydrogenation", these processes optimise the temperature and Fermi level within the silicon via carrier injection to convert the hydrogen into more mobile and reactive charge states. Several commercial tools and processes exist to apply advanced hydrogenation processes to finished cells. Finally, the chapter discusses the potential negative effects of hydrogen where hydrogen itself interacts with the silicon lattice, other impurities, or defects to create new recombination active defects.</description>

      <title>Properties evolution and damage mechanism of SiC/SiC composites after thermal shock at 1300&#176;C</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.06.263</link>

                SiC/SiC composites in aerospace applications are exposed to a variety of thermal conditions, in particular, thermal stress due to rapid heating and cooling. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate and evaluate the resistance of SiC/SiC composites to repeated temperature cycling. This paper investigates the evolution of properties and damage mechanisms of 2D and 2.5D SiC/SiC composites after different thermal shock cycles at 1300&#176;C. It was found that SiC/SiC composites exhibit a temporary weight increase at the beginning of the thermal shock cycle. Subsequently, the weight decreases and stabilizes as the number of thermal shocks increases. After 10-30 thermal shocks at 1300&#176;C, the density of SiC/SiC composites decreases while the porosity increases. The fracture behavior of SiC/SiC composites remains the same as that of the initial composites, with 2D SiC/SiC composites exhibiting pseudo-tough fracture and 2.5D SiC/SiC composites exhibiting brittle fracture. The residual strength of the SiC/SiC composites decreased slightly while the residual modulus remained stable. This is related to the reaction of the SiC, and BN with water and oxygen at high-temperature. The thermal shock damage of SiC/SiC composites is anisotropic and is influenced by the structure of the fiber preforms. This is due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of the components within the composites and the structural properties of the fiber preforms.</description>

      <title>Spin Energy Contributions of the Kinetic Energy Density in the Stabilization of the Metal&#8211;Ligand Interactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c03334</link>
      <description>Pablo Carpio&#8208;Mart&#237;nez, David Ram&#237;rez-Palma, Fernando Cort&#233;s&#8208;Guzm&#225;n, &#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A/&#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A.. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399889771

                The kinetic energy (KE) density plays an essential role in the stabilization mechanism of covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bondings; however, its role in metal&#8211;ligand bindings remains unclear. In a recent work, the energetic contributions of the spin densities &#945; and &#946; were studied to explain the geometrical characteristics of a series of metal&#8211;ligand complexes. Notably, the KE density was found to modulate/stabilize the spin components of the intra-atomic nucleus&#8211;electron interactions within the metal in the complex. Here, we investigate the topographic properties of the spin components of the KE density for a family of high-spin hexa-aquo complexes ([M(H2O)6]2+) to shed light on the stabilization of the metal&#8211;ligand interaction. We compute the Lagrangian, G(r), and Hamiltonian, K(r), KE densities and analyze the evolution of its spin components in the formation of two metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes. We study K&#945;/&#946;(r) along the metal&#8211;oxygen (M&#8211;O) internuclear axis as a function of the metal. Our results indicate that K(r) is a more distance-sensitive quantity compared to G(r) as it displays topographic features at larger M&#8211;O distances. Furthermore, K(r) allows one to identify the predominant interaction mechanism in the complexes.</description>

                In the development of advanced energy saving technologies in the metallurgical industry, a comprehensive approach to managing energy flows is crucial. This article presents an in-depth analysis of the steelmaking and metallurgical industry in China and Russia, focusing on the evolution and current shortcomings of energy saving methods in metallurgical processes. The authors thoroughly analyze various technological processes, including sintering, coking, pellet production, iron production in blast furnaces, steel production in oxygen converters and electric arc furnaces, as well as steel rolling, identifying significant potential for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions. The main outcome of the research is the development of structural models of technological processes based on the concept of energy saving &#8220;temperature matching, cascade utilization, and global linkage&#8221;, covering key stages of steelmaking. These models provide detailed descriptions of the role and interrelation of each process within the complete metallurgical cycle and combine into a comprehensive structural model of steelmaking technological process. The model includes not only specific operations and characteristics of each stage but also explains how these processes interact and depend on each other, forming an integrated and interconnected system of metallurgical production. This model encompasses comprehensive temperature-pressure and production links, providing a theoretical basis for the development of mathematical models of energy saving and the design of corresponding computer applications. The structural model of steelmaking technological process is important for understanding and optimizing the entire process of metallurgical production, contributing to its energy and ecological efficiency.</description>

                Abstract Doping is considered a promising material engineering strategy in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), provided the role of the active site is rightly identified. This work concerns the doping of group VIB metal in Ag 3 PO 4 to enhance the active site density, accompanied by d&#8208;p orbital mixing at the active site/N 2 interface. Doping induces compressive strain in the Ag 3 PO 4 lattice and inherently accompanies vacancy generation, the latter is quantified with positron annihilation lifetime studies (PALS). This eventually alters the metal d&#8208;electronic states relative to Fermi level and manipulate the active sites for NRR resulting into side&#8208;on N 2 adsorption at the interface. The charge density deployment reveals Mo as the most efficient dopant, attaining a minimum NRR overpotential, as confirmed by the detailed kinetic study with the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique. In fact, the Pt ring of RRDE fails to detect N 2 H 4 , which is formed as a stable intermediate on the electrode surface, as identified from in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectroscopy. This advocates the complete conversion of N 2 to NH 3 on Mo/Ag 3 PO 4 &#8208;10 and the so&#8208;formed oxygen vacancies formed during doping act as proton scavengers suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction resulting into a Faradaic efficiency of 54.8% for NRR.</description>

      <title>Formation mechanism and control of a kind of pit-shaped defect in Cf53 rolled products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153273</link>
      <description>Kaimin Wang, Haiyan Tang, Huajun Wang, Xingyu Jia, Jiaquan Zhang, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399771554

                Aiming at the frequent issue of pit-shaped surface defects in S-bearing and Al-killed steel products and the related poor castability due to submerged entry nozzle (SEN) clogging, the melting and casting process of a popular auto steel Cf53 has been studied based on in-situ investigation and experimental analysis. To clarify the generation of the pit-shaped defects, the local surface chemistry, evolution of steel inclusions throughout the melting process, SEN clogging substances, and the internal relationship among them were systematically analyzed. The results show that this type of defect in the Cf53 rolled products is caused by the large-sized composite inclusions rich in CaS, which originate from the molten steel during the refining process, gradually accumulate on the inner wall of the SEN during casting, and finally lead to SEN clogging. The loose structure of clogging inclusions makes them prone to fall off into the mold and get trapped by solidifying steel shell. The formation mechanism of the inclusions was studied through FactSage software calculation. The results show that the increase in total sulfur and total calcium content, and the decrease in total oxygen content and temperature in steel will lead to CaS inclusion formation, which agrees reasonably well with experimental results. An optimized refining process to reduce calcium addition into molten steel is proposed accordingly, which achieves a remarkably alleviation in casting SEN clogging and an elimination of the pit-shaped defects on the final rolled products as well.</description>

                Abstract The advancement of renewable energy is intricately relied on the development of diverse sustainable electrochemical devices. Persuing exceptionally efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative, as it promises to significantly streamline the electrode fabrication process, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of these devices. Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalysts of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported intermetallic PtZn catalyst (PtZn&#8208;IMC@NC) are reported, which performs highly attractively toward the electrocatalysis of glycerol oxidation reactions (GOR), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Its effectiveness are demonstrated as electrocatalysts for both the anode and cathode in a hybrid acid/alkali direct glycerol fuel cell (AA&#8208;DGFC) and a hybrid acid/alkali glycerol&#8208;hydrogen electrolyzer (AA&#8208;GHEC). The AA&#8208;DGFC can release an impressive peak power density of 286.8 mW cm &#8722;2 , while the AA&#8208;GHEC achieves a noteworthy current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at a significantly low applied voltage of 0.47 V. Such intermetallic PtZn&#8208;based trifunctional electrocatalyst empowers them to establish a self&#8208;powered integrated electrochemical device with the AA&#8208;DGFC driving the AA&#8208;GHEC. This setup exemplifies efficient valorization of glycerol into formate in both cells and hydrogen production in electrolyzer device. This study sparks innovation across diverse applications of multifunctional electrocatalysts and infuses renewed momentum into the realm of advanced energy devices.</description>

                Facile mass transport channel and accessible active sites is crucial for binder-free air electrode catalysts in rechargeable flexible zinc-air battery (ZAB). Herein, a ZnS/NH3 dual-assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to prepare N/S-doped hierarchical porous bamboo carbon cloth (HP-NS-BCC) as binder-free air electrode catalyst for ZAB. BCC fabric with abundant micropores is firstly used as flexible carbon support to facilitate the heteroatom-doping and construct the hierarchical porous structure. ZnS nanospheres and NH3 activization together facilitate the electronic modulation of carbon matrix by N/S-doping and optimize the macro/meso/micropores structure of carbon fibers. Benefiting from the highly-exposed N/S-induced sites with enhanced intrinsic activity, the optimized mass transport of biocarbon fibers, as well as the ultra-large specific surface area of 2436.1 m2 g-1, the resultant HP-NS-BCC catalyst exhibits improved kinetics for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. When applied to rechargeable aqueous ZABs, it achieves a high open-circuit voltage of 1.516 V and a significant peak power density of 249.1 mW cm&#8722;2. As binder-free air electrode catalyst, the flexible ZAB also displays stable cycling over 500 cycles with a minimal voltage gap of 0.42 V, showcasing promising applications in flexible electronic devices.</description>

                Visible light-driven photocatalytic water splitting has been considered one of the most promising sustainable approaches toward solar fuel production. As a substitute for metal oxide semiconductors, 2D graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) have been suffered a major challenge owing to its moderate bandgap (&#8764;2.8 eV) and the synergistic effect of using spinel metal ferrites with a narrow bandgap (&#8764;1.7 eV&#8211;1.9 eV) as a cocatalyst is promising to enhance solar energy conversion efficiency and stability. The as-synthesized gCN/copper ferrite (CFO) nanocomposites exhibit 10-fold augmentation in the photocurrent density (&#8764;5 &#956;A cm&#8722;2) compared with pure gCN. Remarkably, the gCN/CFO nanocomposites also exhibit 24 times increment in the rate of photocatalytic H2 evolution (&#8764;488 &#956;mol g&#8722;1) in contrast with pure gCN (&#8764;20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The amalgamation of gCN with metal ferrites has resulted in the development of direct Z-scheme heterojunction at the interface, facilitating the spatial separation of electrons and holes and boosting photocatalytic performance. Oxygen vacancies enhance the photocatalytic efficacy of the nanocomposites, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Moreover, the as-synthesized composites are highly stable in structure and morphology under light irradiation without considerable reduction in the catalytic performance over several cycles. Therefore, this work presents a facile approach using metal ferrites as co-catalysts to develop graphitic carbon-nitride-based photocatalysts for solar light-assisted green fuel generation.</description>

                Abstract Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ), with an ultrawide bandgap corresponding to the deep ultraviolet (DUV) range, has attracted significant attention in optical filter&#8208;free photodetectors. In practical terms, DUV photodetectors employed in extreme conditions, for example, flame detection and space exploration, face the challenges of performance degradation caused by high/low&#8208;temperature transformation. Here, DUV photodetectors are tailored with high durability and stability by one&#8208;step&#8208;grown &#946;&#8208;Ga 2 O 3 films via pulsed laser deposition. A high&#8208;oxygen&#8208;pressure scheme effectively addresses the issue of film&#8208;free deposition at specifically high temperatures, facilitating the formation of polycrystalline high&#8208;resistivity &#946;&#8208;Ga 2 O 3 films. As a result, the devices exhibit outstanding performance, including a low dark current (4.4 pA @30 V), high photoresponsivity (147.36 A W &#8722;1 ), and fast response time (3.1/22.6 ms). Additionally, the photoresponse performance shows minimal degradation at high temperatures up to 300 &#176;C and even improves at low temperatures down to &#8722;100 &#176;C, ranking it among the most robust DUV photodetectors. The mechanism of photoresponse, involving the exciton formation, bandgap evolution, carrier&#8208;phonon scatter, etc., is also elucidated in a wide temperature range. This work provides an efficient solution for developing robust Ga 2 O 3 DUV photodetectors with excellent performance for extreme&#8208;condition applications.</description>

                The supra-molecular structure of a liquid is strongly connected to its dynamics, which in turn control macroscopic properties such as viscosity. Consequently, detailed knowledge about how this structure changes with temperature is essential to understand the thermal evolution of the dynamics ranging from the liquid to the glass. Here, we combine infrared spectroscopy (IR) measurements of the hydrogen (H) bond stretching vibration of water with molecular dynamics simulations and employ a quantitative analysis to extract the inter-molecular H-bond length in a wide temperature range of the liquid. The extracted expansivity of this H-bond differs strongly from that of the average nearest neighbor distance of oxygen atoms obtained through a common conversion of mass density. However, both properties can be connected through a simple model based on a random loose packing of spheres with a variable coordination number, which demonstrates the relevance of supra-molecular arrangement. Furthermore, the exclusion of the expansivity of the inter-molecular H-bonds reveals that the most compact molecular arrangement is formed in the range of &#8764;316-331K (i.e., above the density maximum) close to the temperature of several pressure-related anomalies, which indicates a characteristic point in the supra-molecular arrangement. These results confirm our earlier approach to deduce inter-molecular H-bond lengths via IR in polyalcohols [Gabriel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 154, 024503 (2021)] quantitatively and open a new alley to investigate the role of inter-molecular expansion as a precursor of molecular fluctuations on a bond-specific level.</description>

                Plasma assisted combustion has been demonstrated to extend ignition limits and flame speeds in a variety of combustion environments. Its implementation addresses challenges such as stringent emission and efficiency requirements for power generation and propulsion, and flame holding and ignition in harsh flow environments during supersonic combustion. Plasma assisted combustion leverages the interaction of electric fields with ionized gases, to produce more reactive species, induce turbulence, or locally heat the flow. Timescales associated with plasma generation and high speed flows are short, often on the order of a few microseconds. This makes any experimental investigation of related phenomena inherently difficult. Additionally these short timescales limit the available time for intermolecular energy exchange. This can temporarily produce thermodynamic non-equilibrium, which may in turn affect the flow field and chemical reactions. In this dissertation, pulsed microwave plasmas are investigated in a variety of contexts: microwave plasmas are used to deposit electric field energy into sodium seeded detonation waves; the non-equilibrium created in microwave induced flame plasmas is investigated using high-speed laser diagnostics; and the interaction between laser induced ionization and the microwave field is leveraged for an improvement in molecular tagging velocimetry. The investigation of microwave detonation plasmas focuses on the role of ionization on microwave energy absorption. Alkali metals with low ionization energy thresholds are shown to increase free electron populations by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which increases the microwave energy absorption by a factor of 5 compared to unseeded detonations. The experimental results are shown to agree well with derived models for microwave absorption in high density, weakly ionized plasmas. The vibrational excitation and relaxation of oxygen and nitrogen in microwave flame plasmas with varying gas compositions are interrogated with several diagnostic techniques, including ultra-fast laser diagnostics and electric field measurements. Electron impact dissociation of oxygen and electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules are shown to significantly impact the evolution of the vibrational temperatures of either species. Long lived trace ionization from femtosecond laser pulses is shown to interact with pulsed microwave fields. This lays the foundation for a novel molecular tagging velocimetry technique: laser ionization tagging and emission re-excitation (LaITER). Emissions from LaITER can be measured by fast gated cameras to determine the displacement of tagged molecules and measure velocities. LaITER is demonstrated to improve signal levels, (up to 1000x) and signal lifetimes (up to ~10ms) in flows with varying gas compositions, at ambient and flame temperatures.</description>

      <title>Fast, Efficient Tailoring Growth of Nanocrystalline Diamond Films by Fine-Tuning of Gas-Phase Composition Using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17122976</link>
      <description>Chi Tang, A.J.S. Fernandes, Margarida Fac&#227;o, Alexandre F. Carvalho, Weixia Chen, Haijun Hou, F.M. Costa, Materials. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399778914

                Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films are attractive for many applications due to their smooth surfaces while holding the properties of diamond. However, their growth rate is generally low using common Ar/CH4 with or without H2 chemistry and strongly dependent on the overall growth conditions using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). In this work, incorporating a small amount of N2 and O2 additives into CH4/H2 chemistry offered a much higher growth rate of NCD films, which is promising for some applications. Several novel series of experiments were designed and conducted to tailor the growth features of NCD films by fine-tuning of the gas-phase compositions with different amounts of nitrogen and oxygen addition into CH4/H2 gas mixtures. The influence of growth parameters, such as the absolute amount and their relative ratios of O2 and N2 additives; substrate temperature, which was adjusted by two ways and inferred by simulation; and microwave power on NCD formation, was investigated. Short and long deposition runs were carried out to study surface structural evolution with time under identical growth conditions. The morphology, crystalline and optical quality, orientation, and texture of the NCD samples were characterized and analyzed. A variety of NCD films of high average growth rates ranging from 2.1 &#956;m/h up to 6.7 &#956;m/h were successfully achieved by slightly adjusting the O2/CH4 amounts from 6.25% to 18.75%, while that of N2 was kept constant. The results clearly show that the beneficial use of fine-tuning of gas-phase compositions offers a simple and effective way to tailor the growth characteristics and physical properties of NCD films for optimizing the growth conditions to envisage some specific applications.</description>

                The growing interest in hybrid (aqueous&#8211;organic) electrolytes for electrochemical energy storage is due to their wide stability window, improved safety, and ease of assembly that does not require a moisture-free atmosphere. When it comes to applications in electrochemical capacitors, hybrid electrolytes are expected to fill the gap between high-voltage organic systems and their high discharge rate aqueous counterparts. This article discusses the potential applicability of aqueous&#8211;organic electrolytes utilizing water/N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solvent mixture, and sodium perchlorate as a source of charge carriers. The hydrogen bond formation between H2O and DMAc (mole fraction xDMAc = 0.16) is shown to regulate the original water and cation solvation structure, thus reducing the electrochemical activity of the primary aqueous solution both in the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reactions region. As a result, an electrochemical stability window of 3.0 V can be achieved on titanium electrodes while providing reasonable ionic conductivity of 39 mS cm&#8722;1 along with the electrolyte&#8217;s flame retardant and anti-freezing properties. Based on the diagnostic electrochemical studies, the operation conditions for carbon/carbon capacitors have been carefully optimized to adjust the potential ranges of the individual electrodes to the electrochemical stability region. The system with the appropriate electrode mass ratio (m+/m&#8722; = 1.51) was characterized by a wide operating voltage of 2.0 V, gravimetric energy of 13.2 Wh kg&#8722;1, and practically a 100% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This translates to a significant rise in the maximum energy of 76% when compared to the aqueous counterpart. Additionally, reasonable charge&#8211;discharge rates and anti-freeze properties of the developed electrolyte enable application in a broad temperature range down to &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is demonstrated as well.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Paleosedimentary Environment and Lithofacies: Implications for Shale Oil Enrichment in the Lianggaoshan Formation, Northeastern Sichuan Basin, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c01542</link>

                The sedimentary environment is paramount in dictating depositional processes, ecological settings, and hydrodynamic conditions, all of which are pivotal to the aggregation of organic-rich sediments. A synergistic interplay is observed among the paleosedimentary environment, lithofacies, and enrichment of shale oil. Utilizing an analysis of elemental geochemistry and organic geochemical parameters&#9472;such as total organic carbon (TOC) content&#9472;this study endeavors to identify the predominant factors that govern the enrichment of organic matter (OM). It reconstructs the evolutionary trajectory of the paleosedimentary environment and introduces a dynamic model for shale oil enrichment within the Jurassic Lianggaoshan Formation of the Sichuan Basin. The results indicate that the Lianggaoshan Formation shale can be categorized into five lithological types, including high TOC felsic-rich shale (A), moderate TOC felsic-rich shale (B), moderate TOC felsic-rich mudstone (C), low TOC felsic-rich shale (D), and low TOC felsic-rich mudstone (E), and high TOC felsic-rich shale has the highest TOC and oil content. The shales of the Lianggaoshan Formation were deposited in an environment characterized by abundant terrestrial input, humid climate, freshwater conditions, reduced oxygen levels, and thriving primary productivity. OM enrichment is mainly controlled by the combination of a humid paleoclimate, high primary productivity, and other factors. The paleoenvironment deposited by lithofacies A coincides with the paleoenvironment conducive to OM enrichment, which makes lithofacies A become the dominant lithofacies for shale oil enrichment. Additionally, the sedimentary environment evolution characteristics and shale oil enrichment model of the Lianggaoshan Formation were established based on geochemical parameters. The paleosedimentary environment of the Lianggaoshan Formation from bottom to top is more and more unfavorable. The No.1 submember of the Lianggaoshan Formation is the most potential shale submember for shale oil exploration due to the paleosedimentary environment that promoted the deposition of lithofacies A and OM enrichment.</description>

                Abstract Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4 and 2.4 &#956; m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected the presence of H 2 O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.70   &#8722; 0.93   + 1.27    , consistent with the stellar value, and a supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O   =    0.80   &#8722; 0.11   + 0.07    . We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within 1 &#963; but favored a slightly more substellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio (       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.74   &#8722; 0.17   + 0.23    and C/O   =    0.59   &#8722; 0.14   + 0.13    ). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ( V sys ) and Keplerian ( K p ) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted V sys for H 2 O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H 2 O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Disease Course of COVID-19 and Seasonal Coronavirus Infections in Children</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000004423</link>

None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399854439

                To the Editors: We have read with great interest the article by Bayhan et al1 entitled "Is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Now More Like the Seasonal Coronaviruses Following Its Evolution?" Although SARS-CoV-2 is considered endemic in many parts of the world, the extent to which COVID-19 shares clinical findings with seasonal coronaviruses (sCoVs) is not yet fully understood. This article stated that sCoV infections have a higher lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) risk than COVID-19 and COVID-19 has a milder course than sCoV infections in children. However, the study period was different for each group, particularly patients infected with sCoVs were included in postpandemic period. Herein, we shared our data about pediatric patients due to SARS-CoV-2 during pandemic period between April 2020 and December 2021 versus sCoV. Therefore, our data provide more clear opportunity to understand the actual nature of disease courses of the mentioned infections within the same environment. This retrospective-cohort study was conducted in Ihsan Dogramaci Children Hospital, Turkey. Specimens were analyzed by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction and patients were divided into 3 groups: outpatients and inpatients with sCoV infection and inpatients with COVID-19 (Table 1). Of all 427, the age of inpatients infected with sCoV (2 years) and SARS-CoV-2 (10 years) was different (P &lt; 0.001). Most of the patients (69.2%) had underlying disease in the inpatient sCoV group; 56.9% of them had LRTI, 3.1% had myocarditis and 6.2% presented with sepsis. Similarly, 69.3% of patients with COVID-19 had LRTI, 4% had myocarditis and 8% had sepsis. The leukocyte count was higher in sCoV inpatients (9.6 &#215; 103/&#956;L) than in COVID-19 inpatients (6.1 &#215; 103/&#956;L) (P = 0.003). The absolute lymphocyte count was 0.9 &#215; 10&#179;/uL in COVID-19 group and 2.8 &#215; 10&#179;/uL in inpatients with sCoV infection (P &lt; 0.001). Respiratory support rate was significantly lower in inpatients infected with sCoV (26.2%) than COVID-19 group (66.7%) (P &lt; 0.001). The length of hospital stays, pediatric intensive care unit admission and infection-related mortality rates were similar in both groups. COVID-19 presented with higher disease severity and increased risk of death compared with sCoV-infected adults, but there are few studies in children.1&#8211;3 In the light of the studies, the disease course of COVID-19 looks similar to sCoV infection1,2; however, it should be kept in mind that the need for respiratory support is more common in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the pandemic period. This is an indirect indicator of how appropriate the measures taken are to avoid increasing the burden on hospitals during the pandemic. This slightly severe disease course of the patients with COVID-19 might be attributed to the lower leukocyte and absolute lymphocyte count, but it is still not known why COVID-19 affects older children compared with sCoV.

      <title>eLife assessment: The trunk replaces the longer mandible as the main feeding organ in elephant evolution</title>

                Full text Figures and data Peer review Side by side Abstract eLife assessment eLife digest Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods Appendix 1 Data availability References Article and author information Metrics Abstract The long-trunked elephantids underwent a significant evolutionary stage characterized by an exceptionally elongated mandible. The initial elongation and subsequent regression of the long mandible, along with its co-evolution with the trunk, present an intriguing issue that remains incompletely understood. Through comparative functional and eco-morphological investigations, as well as feeding preference analysis, we reconstructed the feeding behavior of major groups of longirostrine elephantiforms. In the Platybelodon clade, the rapid evolutionary changes observed in the narial region, strongly correlated with mandible and tusk characteristics, suggest a crucial evolutionary transition where feeding function shifted from the mandible to the trunk, allowing proboscideans to expand their niches to more open regions. This functional shift further resulted in elephantids relying solely on their trunks for feeding. Our research provides insights into how unique environmental pressures shape the extreme evolution of organs, particularly in large mammals that developed various peculiar adaptations during the late Cenozoic global cooling trends. eLife assessment This study presents fundamental findings on the evolution of extremely elongated mandibular symphysis and tusks in longirostrine gomphotheres from the Early and Middle Miocene of northern China. The integration of multiple methods provides compelling results in the eco-morphology, behavioral ecology, and co-evolutionary biology of these taxa. In doing so, the authors elucidate the diversification of fossil proboscideans and their likely evolutionary responses to late Cenozoic global climatic changes. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.90908.3.sa0 Read the peer reviews About eLife assessments eLife digest The elephant's trunk is one of the most efficient food-gathering organs in the animal kingdom. From large branches to thin blades of grass, it can coil around and bring many types of vegetation to the animals' strong, short mandibles. This versatility allows elephants to thrive in a range of environments, including grasslands. Trunks are not the only spectacular feature to emerge in Proboscideans, the family of which elephants are the only surviving group. During the early and middle Miocene (between 23 to 11.6 million years ago), many of these species had dramatically elongated lower jaws; how and why this trait emerged then disappeared is poorly understood. The role that lengthened mandibles and trunks played during feeding also remains unclear. To address these questions, Li et al. focused on Platybelodon, Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium, which belong to three Proboscidean families that roamed Northern China between 17 and 15 million years ago. Each had elongated lower jaws, but with strikingly distinct lengths and morphologies. Chemical analyses on enamel samples helped determine which habitat the families occupied, while mathematical modelling revealed how their mandibles tackled different types of plants. Trunk shape was assessed via analyses of the nasal region. The results suggest that Choerolophodon had mandibles better suited for processing branches and a short, 'primitive' trunk. Gomphotherium sported a versatile jaw that could handle both grass and trees, as well as a rather 'elephant-like' trunk. The jaw of Platybelodon seemed well-adapted to cut grass, and remarkable bone structures point towards a long, strong and flexible trunk. While modern elephants fully depend on their trunks to eat, morphological constraints suggest that, in these species, the appendage only served to assist feeding (e.g., by pressing down on branches). All families shared an environment that included grasslands and forests, but analyses suggest that, for a period, Choerolophodon favored relatively closed habitats while Platybelodon spread into grasslands and Gomphotherium navigated both landscapes. This suggests that the evolution of long, strong and flexible trunks is tightly associated with grazing. About 14 million years ago, a global cooling event led to grasslands expanding worldwide. The fossil record shows the mandibles of Proboscideans starting to shorten after this period, including in the descendants of Gomphotherium that would give rise to modern elephants. The work by Li et al. sheds light onto these evolutionary processes, and the environmental pressures which helped shape the trunk. Introduction Proboscideans are known for their exceptionally elongated and versatile trunks (Shoshani, 1998). However, unlike modern elephants, proboscideans underwent a prolonged evolutionary phase characterized by the presence of greatly elongated mandibular symphysis and mandibular tusks. This elongation can be traced back to the Late Oligocene species Palaeomastodon and Phiomia, which are among the earliest elephantiforms (Andrews, 1906), and continued through to the Late Miocene Stegotetrabelodon, a stem elephantid (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). Extreme longirostriny, a feature observed in fossil and modern fishes, reptiles, and birds, was relatively rare among terrestrial mammals and its occurrence in large-bodied proboscideans is particularly intriguing. Particularly, during the Early and Middle Miocene (approximately 20&#8211;11 Ma), the morphology of mandibular symphysis and tusks exhibited remarkable diversity, with over 20 genera from six families (Deinotheriidae, Mammutidae, Stegodontidae, 'Gomphotheriidae', Amebelodontidae, and Choerolophodontidae) displaying variations (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). Why did proboscideans have evolved such a long mandible of so diversified morphology? How did fossil proboscideans use their strange mandibular symphysis and tusks, and what was the role of trunk in their feeding behavior? Finally, what was the environmental background for the co-evolution of their mandible and trunks, and why did proboscideans finally lose their long mandible? These important issuers on proboscideans evolution and adaptation remain poorly understood. Addressing these significant aspects of proboscidean evolution and adaptation requires comprehensive investigations into the functional and eco-morphology of longirostrine proboscideans. Results Mandible morphology of bunodont elephantiforms During the Early and Middle Miocene, bunodont elephantiforms, as the ancestral group of living elephants, flourished (Osborn, 1936; Gheerbrant and Tassy, 2009; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). Bunodont elephantiforms include Amebelodontidae, Choerolophodontidae, and 'Gomphotheriidae'; all possess a greatly elongated mandibular symphysis (Gheerbrant and Tassy, 2009; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). Our comprehensive phylogenetic reconstructions contained the majority of longirostrine elephantiform taxa at the species level and strongly supported this taxonomic scheme (Figure 1A; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 1, Figure 1&#8212;source data 1). The three families were characterized by their distinctive mandible and mandibular tusk morphology (Shoshani, 1996; Tassy, 1996). The paraphyletic 'Gomphotheriidae' have clubbed lower tusks (Figure 1B and K; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2B); their mandibular symphysis is relatively narrow. This morphology is rather unspecialized, and the extant elephants are derived from 'Gomphotheriidae' (Tassy, 1996; Cantalapiedra et al., 2021). The mandibular symphysis of Amebelodontidae is generally shovel-like and the mandibular tusks are usually flattened and wide. Platybelodon is the most specialized genus within this family; it possesses extremely flattened and widened mandibular tusks with a sharp distal cutting edge (Wang et al., 2013: Figure 1C, I, and J; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2A). Choerolophodontidae is unique because it completely lacks mandibular tusks and it has a long trough-like mandibular symphysis (Figure 1D, L, and M, Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2C&#8211;F). A very deep slit is present on each side of the distal alveolar crest (distal mandibular trough edge: Figure 1L), which is presumably for holding a keratinous cutting plate (Figure 1M), similar to the slits for holding large claws in felids and some burrowing mammals (e.g. anteaters). The anterior mandibular foramen of Choerolophodon is extremely large and tube-like (Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 2D), which indicates a very developed mental nerve and eponymous artery (Eales, 1926), for the nutrition of tissues (i.e. keratins) grown from symphyseal dermis. The three lineages exhibit different evolutionary states of food acquisition organs (PC1 scores from mandible and tusk characters; see Materials and methods: Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 4; Figure 1&#8212;figure supplement 5B). Different food acquisition organs morphology strongly indicate different methods of food acquisition among the three gomphothere families.

However, the relative abundances of these three families were very different and varied through time. We investigated fossil bunodont elephantiforms from four regions: Linxia Basin (LX), Tongxin region (TX), Junggar Basin (JG), and Tunggur region (TG) (Figure 2, Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 1, Figure 2&#8212;source data 1). We focused on different fossil assemblages in different ages. We evaluated the amounts of fossils of each elephantiform taxon from major fossil assemblages in the above regions from three museums (IVPP, HPM, and AMNH, for full names, please see the Materials and methods) and calculated their proportions among all bunodont elephantiforms fossils (Figure 2A; Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 2A). During ~19&#8211;17 Ma, the quantities of both Choerolophodon (Choerolophodontidae) and Protanancus (Amebelodontidae) were larger than those of Gomphotherium ('Gomphotheriidae') despite the high diversity of Gomphotherium in species level. During ~17&#8211;15 Ma (the Mid&#8211;Miocene Climate Optimum [MMCO]), the relative fossil abundances of the three gomphothere families were similar. However, within Amebelodontidae, Platybelodon appeared and rapidly replaced the primitive Protanancus. After ~14.5 Ma (i.e. the beginning of the Mid&#8211;Miocene Climate Transition [MMCT]) (Westerhold et al., 2020), Choerolophodon suddenly experienced regional extinction, and Gomphotherium also gradually declined. Within Amebelodontidae, Aphanobelodon, which is morphologically similar to Platybelodon, only occurred in one fossil assemblage, and the Platybelodon population greatly expanded. After ~13 Ma, Gomphotherium were regionally extinct, and Platybelodon became the only genus among bunodont elephantiforms.

Overall, the &#948;13C values indicate a relatively open environment that consisted of a diverse range of habitats (including grasslands, wooded grasslands, and forests) dominated by C3 plants in northern China from ~19 to 11.5 Ma (Figure 2B, Figure 2&#8212;figure supplement 1). In LX1 (Figure 2B; Figure 2&#8212;source data 2), at approximately ~18.5 Ma (see Supplementary file 1), both &#948;13C and &#948;13O values of Choerolophodon and Protanancus are similar and have a wide range of overlap, and those of Gomphotherium are in the middle of the range. This indicates that the niches of these three groups overlapped without obvious differentiation. In TX1,2 (~17.3 Ma) (Deng et al., 2019), during which Platybelodon first appeared, the &#948;13C values of Platybelodon are lower than those of Protanancus. The &#948;13C values of Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium, however, are all within the &#948;13C range of Amebelodontidae. In JG2 (~16 Ma), the &#948;13C value of Platybelodon shows a distinct positive shift, which indicates expansion into more open habitats (Figure 2B). However, Choerolophodon may have persisted in a relatively closed environment (Figure 2B). Moreover, the ecological niche of Gomphotherium appeared to be in between those of Platybelodon and Choerolophodon, and they potentially lived in the boundary area of open and closed habitats (Figure 2B). This isotopic niche pattern is also observed in JG3 (~14.3 Ma), with the rise of Platybelodon and decline of Choerolophodon and Gomphotherium. In TX3, LX4, and TG2,3 (after ~14 Ma), only Platybelodon were examined (as Gomphotherium specimens are too rare to sample); its ecological niche was similar to that previously occupied by Choerolophodon after the latter went extinct. Specialized feeding behaviors of three gomphothere families To reconstruct the feeding behaviors of the three gomphothere families, we performed finite element (FE) analyses on three models as representatives of each family: Choerolophodon, Gomphotherium, and Platybelodon (for model settings, see Figure 3&#8212;figure supplements 1&#8211;4; Supplementary files 1 and 2). We conducted two kinds of tests: the distal forces test and the twig-cutting test. In the distal forces test, after full muscle forces were exerted, a 5000 N vertical force is loaded on the distal end of each mandible (Figure 3A&#8211;C, Videos 1&#8211;3). The mandible strain energy curve (MSEC) of Platybelodon suddenly reaches a very high value, while the MSEC increases of Gomphotherium and Choerolophodon are far less than that of Platybelodon (Figure 3D). Then, keeping the magnitude of the external force unchanged, with change of the external force from vertical to horizontal direction, the MSEC of Platybelodon decreases even lower than that of Gomphotherium and was similar to that of Choerolophodon. This result indicates that the mechanical performance of the Platybelodon mandible is disadvantageous under distal vertical external forces, but greatly improved under horizontal external forces (Figure 3A&#8211;C, Videos 1&#8211;3).

In twig-cutting tests, a cylindrical twig model of orthotropic elastoplasticity was posed in three directions to the distal end of the mandibular tusks of Platybelodon and Gomphotherium, and to the keratinous cutting plate of Choerolophodon. The sum of the equivalent plastic strain (SEPS) from total twig elements was calculated (equivalent plastic strain represents the irreversible deformation of an element, and the sum from all twig elements can reflect the cutting effects) (Figure 3E), and the cutting videos are provided (Videos 4&#8211;9; Video 10; Video 11; Video 12; Video 13; Video 14; Video 15; Video 16; Video 17; Video 18 Video 19). When the twig was placed horizontally, the SEPS of the Choerolophodon model is the largest, which means that Choerolophodon has the highest twig-cutting efficiency, followed by Gomphotherium; while Platybelodon exhibits the much lower efficiency in cutting horizontal twigs than the other two models. When the twig was placed obliquely (45&#176; orientation), the Platybelodon model still shows the smallest SEPS value, although it was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the horizontal twig. Finally, when the twig itself was in a vertical direction, the growth direction of the keratinous cutting plate determines that Choerolophodon cannot cut in this condition. The SEPS of the Gomphotherium model also decreases and shows lower cutting efficiency. In contrast, the SEPS of the Platybelodon model increases another order of magnitude, which is substantially larger than that of any other taxa in any cutting state. These data strongly indicate that Platybelodon mandible is specialized for cutting vertically growing plants. However, the Choerolophodon mandible is specialized for cutting horizontally or obliquely growing plants, this explains the absence of mandibular tusks, but they are likely not able to feed on vertically growing plants. The cutting effect of the Gomphotherium mandible is relatively even for all directions. Video 4 Download asset This video cannot be played in place because your browser does support HTML5 video.
