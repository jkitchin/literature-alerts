      <title>Coordination and Architecture Regulation of Electrocatalysts for Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/accountsmr.3c00197</link>
      <description>Ming Shi, Di Bao, Jun&#8208;Min Yan, Haixia Zhong, Xinbo Zhang, Accounts of Materials Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390937271

                ConspectusWith the increasing concerns about the energy and environmental crisis, hydrogen, with the high energy density and cleanliness, has been widely regarded as one ideal energy carrier for adjusting the fossil fuel dependent energy system. In this context, extensive studies are focused on improving the efficiency of the sustainable hydrogen production, storage, and utilization coupled with the renewable energy. And it can be realized in electrolysis cells and fuel cell devices. Several electrochemical reactions are involved, such as water splitting (hydrogen/oxygen evolution: HER/OER) for hydrogen production, electroreduction of nitrogen/nitrate, and carbon dioxide to NH3 and HCOOH (NRR, NO3RR, CO2RR) for hydrogen storage, and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen utilization. However, the achieved efficiency of the hydrogen energy conversion is still unsatisfactory due to these intrinsically sluggish electrochemical reactions, which has spawned a revival of research interests in developing the electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability. Therefore, various strategies have been established to construct effective electrocatalysts, such as coordination or architecture structure regulation, which will determine the intrinsic activity and the efficiency of mass transport, respectively. Besides, combined with the progress of characterization techniques and theoretical studies, insightful understanding of the electrocatalytic sites and reaction mechanism are also investigated, guiding the rational design of future electrocatalysts.In this Account, we summarize our recent efforts in exploring electrocatalysts through the regulation of coordination and construction of porous architecture structures toward the highly efficient electrochemical hydrogen energy conversion. First, an overview of the hydrogen energy conversion process is presented to reveal the advantages and challenges of these reactions. Then, we introduced effective strategies to optimize the coordination and architecture structure to enhance the catalytic performance, such as tailoring the particle size, valence state, and crystal plane, defect engineering, substrate incorporation, structural reconstruction, etc. Additionally, it is also illustrated the insightful mechanism study on the improvement of the catalytic performance via the experimental characterization and theoretical calculations. Finally, a brief outlook is proposed to address the challenges to be overcome for improving the hydrogen conversion efficiency through developing rational catalysts.</description>

      <title>Data driven computational design of stable oxygen evolution catalysts by DFT and machine learning: Promising electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2023.12.048</link>
      <description>Hwanyeol Park, Yunseok Kim, Sang&#8208;Hoon Choi, Ho Jun Kim, Journal of Energy Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390937419

                The revolutionary development of machine learning (ML), data science, and analytics, coupled with its application in material science, stands as a significant milestone of the scientific community over the last decade. Investigating active, stable, and cost-efficient catalysts is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction owing to the significance in a range of electrochemical energy conversion processes. In this work, we have demonstrated an efficient approach of high-throughput screening to find stable transition metal oxides under acid condition for high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts through density functional theory (DFT) calculation and a machine learning algorithm. A methodology utilizing both the Materials Project database and DFT calculations was introduced to assess the acid stability under specific reaction conditions. Building upon this, OER catalytic activity of acid-stable materials was examined, highlighting potential OER catalysts that meet the required properties. We identified IrO2, Fe(SbO3)2, Co(SbO3)2, Ni(SbO3)2, FeSbO4, Fe(SbO3)4, MoWO6, TiSnO4, CoSbO4, and Ti(WO4)2 as promising catalysts, several of which have already been experimentally discovered for their robust OER performance, while others are novel for experimental exploration, thereby broadening the chemical scope for efficient OER electrocatalysts. Descriptors of the bond length of TM&#8211;O and the first ionization energy were used to unveil the OER activity origin. From the calculated results, guidance has been derived to effectively execute advanced high-throughput screenings for the discovery of catalysts with favorable properties. Furthermore, the intrinsic correlation between catalytic performance and various atomic and structural factors was elucidated using the ML algorithm. Through these approaches, we not only streamline the choice of the promising electrocatalysts but also offer insights for the design of varied catalyst models and the discovery of superior catalysts.</description>

      <title>Nife2o4 in Mose2 Exhibits Bifunctional Water Oxidation and Oxygen Reduction (Oer and Orr) Catalytic Reactions for Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4698366</link>
      <description>Merin Mary Sebastian, Ditty Dixon, T. Daniel Thangadurai, Alex Schechter, Nandakumar Kalarikkal, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390938954

                Abstract: Highly active bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts made of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) supported on MoSe2 nanosheets have been rigorously studied in our present work. The OER activity evaluation was conducted in an alkaline solution for all catalysts. The MoSe2@NiFe2O4 (1:1) catalyst, which had shown superior activity compared to other catalysts, delivered 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of 1.50 V vs. RHE, similar to the state-of-the-art commercial IrO2. The ORR activity of the MoSe2@NiFe2O4 electrocatalyst exhibited an ORR onset potential of 0.83 V vs. RHE. We report MoSe2@NiFe2O4 bifunctional catalyst for noticeable activity in ORR and OER, with a potential difference (&#916;E) of 0.84 V. In the accelerated test, after 5000 potential cycles, the MoSe2@NiFe2O4 (1:1) catalyst had about 86% retention of the ORR diffusion-limiting current density. The OER depicts a loss of around 70.6% after 2000 cycles, which is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art IrO2, deactivated after 2000 cycles. Harnessing the excellent bifunctionality of our catalyst in a Zn&#8211;air battery depicts 300 cycles with a loss of only 55 % in charging capacity and 5% in discharge capacity after 200 cycles at a current density of 20 mA cm-2. Considering the excellent bi-functional activity, the MoSe2@NiFe2O4 hetero-structured composite is an exceptional candidate for energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>Copper oxide nanofibers obtained by solution blow spinning as catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.01.213</link>

                In this work, we report copper oxide nanofibers (CuO &#8211; N) synthesized by Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and their comparison with a control sample based on a commercial powder (CuO &#8211; C). Both materials were characterized by various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and spectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman and X-ray photoelectron (XPS)) to confirm the purity, and microstructural and surface chemical properties. Subsequently, the performance of copper oxide catalysts in a 1.0 M KOH solution was investigated. Copper oxide with nanofiber morphology (CuO &#8211; N) exhibited a small overpotential of 385 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel coefficient of only 76 mV dec&#8722;1, i.e., fast kinetics for water splitting, a result that is modulated by oxygen vacancies (O2/O1 = 0.83). The oxygen vacancies are due to the presence of Cu1+ in the lattice. The analyses of the magnetization measurements at 5 K suggest a larger amount of Cu1+ in sample CuO &#8211; N. Therefore, this work sheds light on how to design low-cost nanofibrous catalysts based on abundant transition metals in the earth's crust by SBS, an economical and scalable technique, which is promising for energy applications.</description>

      <title>Review of acidic titanium-based oxygen evolution anode catalyst design: mechanistic, compositional design, and research status</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.173576</link>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key half-reaction in fields including water electrolysis, organic synthesis, and water treatment. With the development of the industry, research into highly active and stable oxygen evolution anodes in an acidic environment is essential. DSA is the dimensionally stable anode. Widespread attention has been paid to titanium-based DSAs in the field of acidic oxygen precipitation due to their low overpotential and high acid resistance. The titanium-based anode mainly consists of two parts: catalyst and titanium substrate, where the design of the catalyst is the key to the anode design. The factors affecting the catalytic activity and durability of the titanium-based DSA were heterogeneous and rarely reported. In this paper, the influence of catalytic mechanism and composition design on the catalytic activity and service life of anode is reviewed from the perspective of the catalyst. Then, the current situation related to anode preparation is summarized, and an improvement strategy to enhance the activity and stability of anode is proposed based on the failure mode of titanium-based DSA.</description>

      <title>Ce-doped multi-phase NiMo-based phosphorus/sulfide heterostructure for efficient photo-enhanced overall water splitting at high current densities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.110</link>
      <description>Pan Zhao, Aojie Yuan, Yangrui Zhang, Huan Liu, Juan Du, Long Chen, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 660(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390977054

                NiMo-based electrocatalysts are widely regarded as promising electrocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). However, to solve the problem of slow reaction kinetics and serious deactivation at high current density, the reasonable design of NiMo-based electrocatalysts is still a great challenge. In this work, NiMo-based phosphorus/sulfide heterostructure electrocatalysts with different Ce doping ratios (5%/10%/15%Ce-NiMo-PS@NF) have been designed using the combination of cation doping and heterostructure engineering. The doping of Ce not only changes the electronic environment of the heterostructure, accelerates the electron transport at the heterostructure interface, but also enhances the light absorption capacity of the heterostructure. The experimental results show that 10%Ce-NiMo-PS@NF has the best photo-enhanced electrocatalytic activity (hydrogen evolution reaction (HER): &#951;1000 = 250 mV, oxygen evolution reaction (OER): &#951;1000 = 242 mV, and OWS: E1000 = 1.864 V). In addition, its solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency in a photoelectric coupled water splitting system is as high as 18.68%. This study not only provides a new method for the synthesis of new heterostructure electrocatalysts, but also provides a reference for the rational use of light energy to enhance electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Constructing Asymmetrical Coordination Microenvironment with Phosphorus&#8208;Incorporated Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202314444</link>
      <description>Zhijun Li, Siqi Ji, Hongxue Liu, Xu Chen, Chengchao Guo, Xue Li, Haixin Sun, Shuo Dou, Shixuan Xin, J. Hugh Horton, Cheng He, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390978765

                Abstract Carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts have been recognized as inexpensive alternatives to afford excellent activity in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Nevertheless, precisely identifying the local active sites and tailoring the corresponding electronic properties to enhance the reaction kinetics remain challenging. Herein, a facile strategy to create a metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst comprised of a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix with phosphorus incorporation (NPC) is described. The as&#8208;prepared NPC&#8208;950 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior ORR activity under alkaline and acidic conditions with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.88 and 0.72 V, respectively, comparable to commercial Pt/C (0.85 and 0.76 V) and overwhelmingly superior to other N&#8208;doped carbon catalyst materials. In addition, a remarkable promotion of OER activity under alkaline conditions is observed. Notably, a zinc&#8211;air battery equipped with this NCP&#8208;950 electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional performance in peak power density, specific capacity, and long&#8208;term operation durability. Theoretical calculations uncover that the incorporation of phosphorus in NC material results in effective charge density redistribution, thus modulating the electronic properties of active sites to achieve optimum adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates. The work provides a deep understanding of active sites in heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon materials and highlights the importance of the electronic properties modulation in oxygen bifunctional electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>A Cluster-Type Self-Healing Catalyst for Stable Saline&#8211;Alkali Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14010081</link>
      <description>Haiming Wang, Sheng Chen, Catalysts. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390986406

                In electrocatalytic processes, traditional powder/film electrodes inevitably suffer from damage or deactivation, reducing their catalytic performance and stability. In contrast, self-healing electrocatalysts, through special structural design or composition methods, can automatically repair at the damaged sites, restoring their electrocatalytic activity. Here, guided by Pourbaix diagrams, foam metal was activated by a simple cyclic voltammetry method to synthesize metal clusters dispersion solution (MC/KOH). The metal clusters-modified hydroxylated Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide electrode (MC/NixFeyOOH) by a facile Ni-Fe metal&#8211;organic framework-reconstructed strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the mixture of MC/KOH and saline&#8211;alkali water (MC/KOH+SAW). Specifically, using a nickel clusters-modified hydroxylated Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide electrode (NC/NixFeyOOH) for OER, the NC/NixFeyOOH catalyst has an ultra-low overpotential of 149 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2, and durable stability of 100 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. By coupling this OER catalyst with an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, high activity and durability in overall SAW splitting is exhibited. What is more, benefiting from the excellent fluidity, flexibility, and enhanced catalytic activity effect of the liquid NC, we demonstrate a self-healing electrocatalysis system for OER operated in the flowing NC/(KOH+SAW). This strategy provides innovative solutions for the fields of sustainable energy and environmental protection.</description>

                Individuals experiencing poverty and possessing limited financial resources are particularly susceptible to impacts of climate change and rising costs associated with fossil fuels. In response to this pressing issue, researchers are actively investigating water oxidation as a sustainable solution to mitigate the challenges posed by climate changes and energy crisis. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which plays a pivotal role in water electrolysis, necessitates the utilization of highly stable and efficient electrode materials to overcome its intrinsic sluggish kinetics and enhance the overall efficiency of the electrochemical device. This investigation employed a reduction method to synthesize manganese oxide (MnO) nanoparticles, using manganese telluride (MnTe) as the base material, yielding a MnTe@MnO nanocomposite. This innovative composite was subsequently immobilized onto a nickel foam (NF) substrate. Remarkably, the MnTe@MnO nanocomposite exhibited exceptional OER performance in a 1.0 M alkaline solution, manifesting an impressively low overpotential of 208 mV at a benchmark current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This overpotential significantly surpassed that of the individual MnTe and MnO electrode materials, underscoring the synergistic advantages of the MnTe@MnO nanocomposite. Further analysis revealed a notably shallow Tafel slope of 39 mV dec-1, indicative of the enhanced reaction kinetics and electrocatalytic efficiency inherent to the MnTe@MnO nanocomposite. Moreover, the durability assessment over a span of 30 h demonstrated minimal current loss, emphasizing the substantial electrocatalytic active surface area of the fabricated nanocomposite.</description>

                The intelligent construction of non-noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of znic-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure-amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer-derived N, S, P co-doped carbon sphere (A-MnO2 /NSPC) is designed using a self-doped pyrolysis coupled with an in-situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A-MnO2 /NSPC-2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64 V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance.

                Hastening the progress of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries and hydrogen fuel cells necessitates the advancement of economically feasible, earth-abundant, inexpensive, and efficient electrocatalysts facilitating both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a recently reported family of nano (5A1/5)Co2O4 (A = combinations of transition metals, Mg, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) compositionally complex oxides (CCOs) [Wang et al., Chemistry of Materials, 2023, 35 (17), 7283&#8211;7291.] are studied as bifunctional OER and ORR electrocatalysts. Among the different low-temperature soft-templating samples, those subjected to 600 &#176;C postannealing heat treatment exhibit superior performance in alkaline media. One specific composition (Mn0.2Fe0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)Co2O4 exhibited an exceptional overpotential (260 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) for the OER, a favorable Tafel slope of 68 mV dec&#8211;1, excellent onset potential (0.9 V) for the ORR, and lower than 6% H2O2 yields over a potential range of 0.2 to 0.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, this catalyst displayed stability over a 22 h chronoamperometry measurement, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Considering the outstanding performance, the low cost and scalability of the synthesis method, and the demonstrated tunability through chemical substitutions and processing variables, CCO ACo2O4 spinel oxides are highly promising candidates for future sustainable electrocatalytic applications.</description>

                The development of an efficient, bifunctional, and affordable catalyst has emerged as a valuable approach in electrocatalysis because it can enhance the conductivity, charge transfer capability, and number of active sites of the catalyst. In this study, we synthesis flower-like morphologies of 1T-phase cobalt (Co)-doped molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) embedded on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) using a facile hydrothermal technique. Owing to this configuration, the optimal Co0.18/1T-Mo0.82S2@N-rGO catalyst exhibits remarkable activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction, with a low overpotential of 243 mV and a Tafel slope of 75 mV/dec at 10 mA/cm2. The catalyst also demonstrates excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 142 mV and a Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec to afford a current density of &#8722;10 mA/cm2 in basic media, which are comparable to platinum on carbon and iridium dioxide, along with excellent stability. To perform overall water splitting, assembled Co0.18/1T-Mo0.82S2@N-rGO (+//-) cell requires only 1.51 V to achieve 10 mA/cm2. This study illustrates the beneficial effect of Co doping on the synthesized flower-shaped MoS2, formation of the 1T phase, and the performance of N-rGO as a conductive network, which holds significant potential in the field of electrocatalysis.</description>

                Nitrogen-doped carbon-based materials exhibit promising prospect as the catalysts to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Incorporating transition metal oxides with the catalysts can endow them with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity to construct bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this work, a catalyst (named as 300NiFe-Mi-C) was prepared by a metal oxide-implanting strategy. The mixed metal salts of Ni and Fe were first heated to produce metal oxides, and then blended with 2-methylimidazole and carbon black, and subsequently pyrolyzed at a high temperature. In the pyrolysis, a part of metal oxides was reduced to metallic state to facilitate the doping of nitrogen atoms into carbon to form the ORR active sites while a part of metal oxides was retained to afford OER activity. Benefiting from the pre-implanting strategy of metal oxides, the resultant 300NiFe-Mi-C presents enhanced OER performance with 1.56 V of OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the 1.68 V of the controlled sample NiFe-Mi-C (without pre-implanting) and 1.70 V of RuO2. The 0.83 V of ORR half-wave potential of 300NiFe-Mi-C is also comparable to the 0.82 V of NiFe-Mi-C and 0.86 V of Pt/C, revealing satisfactory bifunctional catalytic activities. The rechargeable zinc-air battery equipped with 300NiFe-Mi-C can stably operate at ~1.25 V with 10 mA cm&#8722;2, being higher than ~1.21 V of Pt/C+RuO2. The battery also presents outstanding durability and rechargeability, demonstrating the bifunctional activities of 300NiFe-Mi-C can be realized in practical applications.</description>

                Electrocatalysts for water (H2O) splitting to give oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2) fuels are challenging to build, but mixing carbon materials with transition-metal-based compounds offers an intriguing and innovative method for the development of environment-friendly fuel. Hydrothermal synthesis is a cheap and effective catalyst based on a ZnAl2O4 nanocomposite anchored over reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and is presented here, along with characterization by microscopy and spectroscopy. As a possible oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst on nickel foam&#8217;s surface (NF), the electrochemical properties of this catalyst were also studied. The electrochemical studies showed that the ZnAl2O4 anchored on rGO sample exhibited high stability for the OER and an enhanced surface area, ionic conductivity, and active zones of the electrocatalyst was observed compared to that of the other investigated composites. It also exhibited an overpotential of 244 mV achieved at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and lowered solution resistance (Rs = 0.63 &#937;) and charge transfer resistance (Rct = 0.6 &#937;). This catalyst has a wide operating current range and, therefore, may function for long periods of time at both high and low current densities. High electrical conductivity, a larger surface area, and enriched active zones are responsible for enhancing the ZnAl2O4@rGO composite&#8217;s multifunctional qualities, as shown by the results. The electrocatalytic properties of ZnAl2O4@rGO composites were enhanced, and they exhibited a high cycling stability of 50 h even after the 5000th cycle due to the combined influence of these surface features. The present investigation has revealed that the ZnAl2O4@rGO nanocomposite demonstrates significant versatility, making it highly suitable for various fields related to sustainable and renewable energy. This suggests that it could be employed in developing an efficient and promising electrode for the OER, thereby paving the way for new possibilities.</description>

                Abstract Deuterated ammonia (ND3) treatment contributes significantly to the reliability of semiconductors in manufacturing. Current ND3 production suffers from high energy consumption, CO2 emissions and capital expenditure. In this study, we present an electrochemical approach using iron (Fe) single-atom catalysts supported by nitrogen-doped carbon in an electrolyzer, operating at A cm-2 current densities for ND3 production. Through systematic optimization of catalyst composition, electrode/electrolyzer architectures, anodic reactions, and operating conditions, the system achieved a ND3 selectivity exceeding 80% at 200 mA cm-2 and 60% at 600 mA cm-2, with a maximal production rate of 1.73 mmol h-1 cm-2 and stability over 100 hours (assessed at 200 mA cm-2). The full cell voltage is 3.2 V when combined with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode, and it decreases to 2.3 V when coupled with a hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) anode at 600 mA cm-2. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) results demonstrate a fivefold energy consumption reduction to 0.19 MJ molND3-1, threefold emission reduction to 16.13 g molND3-1, and threefold cost reduction to $6,000 from $27,000 kgND3-1, highlighting the potential for widespread commercialization and contributing to the more environmentally sustainable ND3 production.</description>

                Abstract Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been utilized to substitute the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to escalate the energy conversion efficiency in electrochemical hydrogen generation processes with denitrification of widespread urea in wastewater. This study reports breakthroughs in Ni&#8208;based UOR electrocatalysts, particularly with NiFe oxalate (O&#8208;NFF), derived from Ni 3 Fe alloy foam with prismatic nanostructures and elevated surface area. The O&#8208;NFF achieves cutting&#8208;edge performances, representing 500 mA cm &#8722;2 of current density at 1.47 V RHE and exceptionally low Tafel slope of 12.1 mV dec &#8722;1 (in 1 m KOH with 0.33 m urea). X&#8208;ray photoelectron/absorption spectroscopy (XPS/XAS) coupled with density functional theory calculations unveil that oxalate ligands induce charge deficient Ni center, promoting stable urea&#8208;O adsorption. Furthermore, Fe dopants enhance oxalate&#8208;O charge density and H&#8208;bond strength, facilitating C&#8208;N cleavage for N 2 and NO 2 &#8722; formation. The extraordinary UOR kinetics by the tandem effects of oxalate and Fe prevent Ni over&#8208;oxidation, corroborated by operando XAS, minimizing OER interference. It agrees with an adaptive reconstruction to Fe&#8208;doped &#946;&#8208;NiOOH on top surface in extended urea electrolysis with marginal loss in UOR kinetics. This findings shed light to bimetal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework as (pre)catalysts to improve industrial electrolytic H 2 production.</description>

                The emergence of non-precious metal-based robust and economic bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the rational design of commercial rechargeable Zn-air batteries (RZAB) with safe energy conversion and storage systems. Herein, a facile strategy to fabricate a cost-efficient, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst Fe3C/Fe decorated N doped carbon (FeC-700) with a unique structure has been developed by carbonization of a single source precursor, tetrabutylammonium tetrachloroferrate(III) complex. The ORR and OER activity revealed excellent performance (&#916;E = 0.77 V) of the FeC-700 electrocatalyst, comparable to commercial Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. The designed temperature-tuneable structure provided sufficiently accessible active sites for the continuous passage of electrons by shortening the mass transfer pathway, leading to extremely durable electrocatalysts with high ECSA and amazing charge transfer performance. Remarkably, the assembled Zn-air batteries with the FeC-700 catalyst as the bifunctional air electrode delivers gratifying charging-discharging ability with an impressive power density of 134 mW cm-2 with a long lifespan, demonstrating prodigious possibilities for practical application.</description>

                Pulsed and constant direct current electrodepositions were applied to synthesize PbO2-IrO2 nano-composites on Ti substrate. By compositing PbO2 with nano-sized IrO2 particles, a suitable anode was prepared for zinc electrowinning that decreases the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction overpotential (OER) while increasing the electrochemical active surface area and the electrocatalytic activity for OER. To provide PbO2-IrO2 nano-composites on Ti substrate with Sb2O3 interlayer, current density, temperature, and time of anodization are optimized using the one-at-the-time method. The optimal condition for the anode involves a DC time of 1 hour, incorporating 2 g L-1 of IrO2 nanoparticles, maintaining a current density of 50 mA/cm2 for the DC mode, and setting the pulse off-time (toff) to 770 ms. Based on the electrochemical evaluations in a simulated zinc electrowinning electrolyte, the effect of IrO2 nanoparticles on the catalytic activity of Ti/&#946;-PbO2 anode for OER was determined. Anodic polarization curves showed that the OER overpotential of PbO2-IrO2 micro-composite and PbO2-IrO2 nano-composites at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 decreased to 0.471 V, respectively, compared to 0.711 V for pure PbO2. The Nyquist plots in the OER zone confirm that the PbO2-IrO2 nano-composite anode exhibits the lowest Rct 2.79 &#937; compared to 6.0 &#937; and 9.46 &#937; for PbO2-IrO2 micro-composite and pure PbO2, which can be attributed to the presence of electro-catalytic IrO2 nanoparticles.</description>

                Designing novel rare earth-transition metal composites is frontier electrocatalyst research. However, rare earths modulating the electronic structure of the transition metal with the aim of inducing vacancy defects to enhance the electrochemical performance has rarely been reported. Herein, the mechanism of Ce-4f electron-modulation reservoir induced weakening of Fe-O bond to modulate the electronic structure in CeFevNi hydroxide to improve oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance has been systematically investigated. Theoretical calculations and characterization results demonstrate that the Ce-4f orbitals, working as an electron-modulation reservoir, play a crucial role in not only retaining or donating electrons, but also in modulating the electronic structure of the material. Furthermore, Ce-4f bands optimize the Fe lower Hubbard bands (LHB) and O-2p bands, resulting in the weakening of the Fe-O bond to form cationic vacancies for upshifting the d-band center of the active site Ni, which favors the reaction energy barrier of the oxygen intermediate for OER. The synthesized catalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 201 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and demonstrated a lifetime of more than 200 hours at 100 mA cm-2 under alkaline conditions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of the mechanism of rare earth-induced transition metal vacancy defects, which can provide a generalized guideline for the design and development of novel highly efficient catalysts.</description>

                Exploring cost-effective non-noble metal-based catalysts with high activity and stability is of great significance for energy conversion and storage involving oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we employed a laser irradiation technique to synthesis Fe doped CoO nanoparticles with ultrafine size (&#8776; 5.4 nm) and abundant oxygen vacancies (Fe-Ov-CoO). The ultrafine size of Fe-Ov-CoO nanoparticles provides more active sites to be exposed. Fe doping and oxygen vacancy promote the intrinsic activity and electron transfer rates of Fe-Ov-CoO, giving rise to high activity and stability catalyst for OER. Fe-Ov-CoO delivers a large current density of 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 548 mV, which is much better than commercial RuO2. Moreover, Fe-Ov-CoO presents a remarkable long-term stability with negligible degeneration at a high current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2 for 120 h. This work provides a new route to develop OER electrocatalyst with high activity and stability.</description>

                The development of efficient and durable high-current-density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large-scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, we have successfully driven the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu-mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu-BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial-grade current density. The optimal MCu0.10 -BNiMo demonstrated ultrahigh current density (&gt; 2 A cm-2 ) at a smaller overpotential in 1 M KOH (572 mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that MCu0.10 -BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects led to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10 -BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10 -BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell was also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm-2 at 2.12 V and 0.1 A cm-2 at 1.79 V, which is nearly five-fold that of the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. Our strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial-scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst. This article is protected by copyright.

                The exploration of high properties of electrocatalysts is imperative for the commercialization application of fuel cells. The catalytic activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts can be effectively enhanced by rationally designing their morphology and composition. Here, we synthesized self-assembled PtCo alloy nanofoams (ANs) catalysts with controllable surface composition and porous network. The experimental results show that prepared PtxCo1-ANs catalysts display excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Interestingly, the mass activities of Pt2Co1-ANs with optimized surface composition for ORR, MOR, and EOR are 6.41, 6.64, and 7.71-fold higher than commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Meantime, it also maintains high electrocatalytic durability in ORR, MOR, and EOR. Such results ascribe to the modified surface composition, optimized electronic structure, and porous interconnected nanofoam structure. These findings are insight of designing highly active and durable multifunctional electrocatalysts with controllable shapes and composition</description>

                Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstruct a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network beween the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8208;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100 mA cm&#8208;2 @ ~538 mV).</description>

      <title>Surface reconstruction of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ni0.2O3- perovskite nanofibers for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Perovskites have become promising alternatives to precious metal-catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the synthesis of several perovskite nanofibers, specifically La0.6Sr0.4CoxNi1-xO3-&#948; (LSCN), and investigate their electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in alkaline electrolytes. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Ni0.2O3-&#948; (LSCN-0.8) is selected and immersed in an aqueous NaBH4 solution for 1 h for surface reconstruction. The perovskite nanofibers' electrocatalytic OER activity and stability are rigorously evaluated using a standard three-electrode system. Results reveal that even a slight Co substitution for Ni content within the LSCN perovskite structure has a notable impact on electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, LSCN-0.8 exhibits an overpotential of 363 mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH. However, significant improvement is observed after the surface reconstruction process. The optimized LSCN-0.8 (now called LSCN-2) displays the lowest OER overpotential (320 mV) under the same conditions. Furthermore, the LSCN-2 nanostructure demonstrates exceptional electrode stability, as evidenced by only a slight decrease in electrocatalytic performance during 5000 cycles of linear sweep voltammetry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced catalytic activity of ZnWO4 by nickel-doping in oxygen evolution reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2024.108151</link>
      <description>Meng Li, Deijun Xiong, Jinxing Wang, Xiaoyang Dong, Peiyang Zhang, Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing. 173(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391197664

                The development of efficient and low-cost metal materials is indispensable in clean energy technology. Metal tungstates have previously been reported as catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). However, ZnWO4 alone does not exhibit significant catalytic activity for OER, it requires 330 mV to drive the reaction at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. To address this issue, a self-supporting electrode mixed with tungstate is synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Notably, the Ni-doped ZnWO4 self-supporting material demonstrates improved OER catalytic activity. Specifically, when comparing ZnWO4 to ZnNiWO4, it exhibits a reduced Tafel slope by 190 mV&#183;dec&#8722;1, resulting in an overpotential of only 110 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, with long-term stability for at least 20 h. Furthermore, the d-band center of ZnNiWO4 is modeled using Materials Studio and simulated through projected density of states (PDOS) calculations. These calculations reveal that the presence of Ni activates the metal ion as an OER active site with strong orbital overlap with the reaction intermediate. This adjustment in the electronic structure of the Ni&#8211;Zn metal active site during the oxygen evolution reaction alters the adsorption energy. Consequently, doping of Ni enhances the metal's ability to adsorb *OOH radical, shifting the d-band center of ZnNiWO4 further away from the Fermi level, and facilitates rapid oxygen release.</description>

                Hydrogen gas is a promising renewable energy storage medium when produced via water electrolysis, but this process is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we used a microkinetic model to investigate promoting the OER using programmable oxide catalysts (i.e., forced catalyst dynamics). We found that programmable catalysts could increase current density at a fixed overpotential (100X to 600X over static rates) or reduce the overpotential required to reach a fixed current density of 10 mA/cm^2 (45 &#8211; 140% reduction vs. static). In our kinetic parameterization, the key parameters controlling the quality of the catalytic ratchet were the O*-to-OOH* and O*-to-OH* activation barriers. Our findings indicate that programmable catalysts may be a viable strategy for accelerating the OER or enabling lower-overpotential operation, but a more accurate kinetic parameterization is required for precise predictions of performance, ratchet quality, and resulting energy efficiency.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water (H2O) splitting relies heavily on the rational formation of most effective, long-lasting catalysts that should be cheaper and earth abundant. Therefore, an effective electrocatalyst is the need of the hour that may effectively pursue both electrocatalytic OER and HER. This study paves the way for the straightforward preparation of conductive polymer tailored metal oxide nanocomposite Cu2O/CNTs by a facile hydrothermal approach to be employed as overall water splitting electrocatalyst. The techniques comprising SEM, XRD, EDX and the BET test were employed to characterize the synthesized Cu2O/CNTs electrocatalyst. The generated Cu2O/CNTs electrocatalysts exhibited a Tafel value of 39 mV/dec, an overpotential of 267 mV@10 mA/cm2, and stability of OER activity that lasted for at least 70 hours. The electrocatalytic results show that the combination of Cu2O and CNTs has a synergistic impact to reduce the overpotential value. In an effort to pinpoint the rate determining processes for OER, the voltage of OER is connected to the electrolyte pH and exhibits a non-proton concerted approach. The above designed nanocomposite is quite promising for modern hydrogen production systems due to their quick electron transfer mechanism, remarkable durability, and good activity for OER.</description>

                The electrically conductive Cobalt-benzene-1,3,5-tribenzoate metal&#8211;organic framework (Co-BTB) was easily synthesized using the hydrothermal synthesis process. The framework showed a low overpotential (only 170 mV to obtain 10 mA cm&#8722;2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surpassing the benchmark electrocatalyst IrO2 which showed an overpotential of 250 mV at the same obtained current density. Moreover, the Co-BTB possesses good kinetics with an estimated Tafel slope of only 46.5 mV dec&#8722;1. It provided a high density of catalytic centers with electrically conductive characteristics, as suggested by ECSA. The framework was identified as a promising MOF electrocatalyst for the OER due to its performance as well as its chemical and electrochemical robustness.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved 4-electron transfers is generally considered as the bottleneck for electrocatalytic water splitting. High-entropy oxides (HEO) show promising potential for OER due to their flexible structures and tunable compositions. Herein, we report a facile strategy to synthesize spinel-type (FeCoNiMnCr)3O4 HEO nanotubes (NTs) with unique hollow structures by combining electrospinning process and calcination treatment. The (FeCoNiMnCr)3O4 HEO NTs prepared at 400 &#176;C exhibit the low overpotential of 353 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and small Tafel slope of 55.6 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber-based architecture ensure the superior stability, as evidenced by the stable current density under continuous OER process for more than 60 h. Meanwhile, the hollow structure provides abundant exposed active sites, which could significantly improve the OER activity. This work provides new design of low-cost and high-efficient HEO with ensemble active sites for OER.</description>

                An efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are widely required in the realm of water electrolysis and rechargeable metal-air batteries. This work describes an easy and simple method for the synthesis of copper salen (Cu(Salen))-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanocomposite materials (Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs). It was used for OER in the basic medium (0.1 M KOH). The resulting nanocomposite, Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs, was studied using spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. For example, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), UV-visible spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The electrochemical characterization of prepared Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs nanocomposite based modified glassy carbon (GC) electrodes (GC/Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs) and their application towards OER were performed using an electrochemical method. The Tafel slope of nanocomposite material is 159.6 mv/dec in 0.1 M KOH solution, indicating that GC/Cu(Salen)/MWCNTs could be a promising and cost-effective electrode material for the OER. This study demonstrates a novel way for creating an active nanocomposite catalyst for OER in alkaline media.</description>

                Abstract Perovskite oxides exhibit bifunctional activity for both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), making them prime candidates for energy conversion in applications like fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Their intrinsic catalytic prowess, combined with low&#8208;cost, abundance, and diversity, positions them as compelling alternatives to noble metal and metal oxides catalysts. This review encapsulates the nuances of perovskite oxide structures and synthesis techniques, providing insight into pivotal active sites that underscore their bifunctional behavior. The focus centers on the breakthroughs surrounding lanthanum (La) and strontium (Sr)&#8208;based perovskite oxides, specifically their roles in zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). An introduction to the mechanisms of ORR and OER is provided. Moreover, the light is shed on strategies and determinants central to optimizing the bifunctional performance of La and Sr&#8208;based perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>NiCo2O4/MXene hybrid as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301250</link>

                For the advancement of energy conversion and storage technologies, bifunctional electrocatalysts are crucial for efficiently driving both the oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction reactions (ORR). Cobalt&#8208;based spinel oxides are a class of promising bifunctional electrocatalysts. However their low electrical conductivity and stability may hinder further improvement. A novel composite material composed of NiCo2O4(NCO) nanoparticles integrated with emerging two dimensional MXene nanosheets (NCO/MXene) was developed. The successful integration of NCO with MXene brings about a number of attractive structural features. This includes synergistic effects between NCO and MXene, highly accessible surface areas, complete exposure of numerous active sites, and excellent electronic conductivity, all of which collectively contribute to the desirability of composite material for OER and ORR. The synthesized NCO/MXene composite showed extraordinary OER electrocatalytic activity with a lower overpotential of 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, and a small Tafel slope of 64.63 mV/dec compared to NCO, MXene and NCO+MXene (physically mixed). Additionally, it displays a superior ORR limiting current density (&#8208;4 mA/cm2). In particular, it exhibited highest onset potential and half wave potential of 0.92 V and 0.72 V vs. RHE, respectively, for the ORR in alkaline media</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Optimization Method for the Oxygen Evolution and Reduction Reaction of the High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>

                In recent times, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have found application in heterogeneous catalysis, capitalizing on their vast chemical potential. Yet, this extensive chemical landscape presents significant challenges when attempting a comprehensive exploration of HEAs through traditional trial-and-error approaches. Therefore, the machine learning (ML) approach is offered to appearance into the catalytic activity (CA) of countless sensitive sites on HEA surfaces in the oxygen-lessening response (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). In this research, a Density Functional Theory (DFT) with a supervised ML model is assembled and founded on the gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm that predicted the O2 adsorption energies with a high overpotential of all surface sites on the two HEAs. Initially, the HEAs Co-Fe-Ga-Ni-Zn and Al-Cu-Pd-Pt offer a framework for adjusting the composition of disordered multi-metallic alloys to regulate the activity and selectivity of the reduction of oxygen to extremely reduced compounds. This attains generalizability, high accuracy and simplicity with the proposed technique. For fine-tuning such features, HEAs provide a huge compositional space. Consequently, the research reports the custom of the Bayesian optimization model based on HEA active compositions to suppress the formation of Oxygen (O2) and with strong O2 adsorption to favour the lessening of O2. The GBR approach is applied to build a highly accurate, easily generalizable, and effective ML model. The proposed work is analysed using Python software. The findings show that the separate charities of correlated metal atoms close to the responsive site are mixed to form the adsorption energy, which is clear from a thorough analysis of the data. It is suggested that a highly effective HEA catalyst composed of Co-Fe-Ga-Ni-Zn and Al-Cu-Pd-Pt be exploited, which is an effective method for further enhancing the ORR CA of potential HEA catalysts. An instruction manual for the logical design and synthesis of HEA catalysts' nanostructures is provided by the proposed research.</description>

                Exploring highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become a growing interest in recent years. Herein, an efficient pathway for designing MXene-based ORR/OER catalysts is proposed. It involves introducing non-noble metals into Vo (vacancy site), H1 and H2 (the hollow sites on top of C and the metal atom, respectively) sites on M2CO2 surfaces, named TM-VO/H1/H2-M2CO2 (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, M = V, Nb, Ta). Among these recombination catalysts, Co-H1-V2CO2 and Ni-H1-V2CO2 exhibit the most promising ORR catalytic activities, with low overpotential values of 0.35 and 0.37 V, respectively. Similarly, Fe-H1-V2CO2, Co-VO-Nb2CO2, and Ni-H2-Nb2CO2 possess low OER overpotential values of 0.29, 0.39, and 0.44 V, respectively, suggesting they have enormous potential as effective catalysts for OER. Notably, Co-H2-Ta2CO2 possesses the lowest potential gap value of 0.53 V, demonstrating it has an extraordinary bifunctional catalytic activity. The excellent catalytic performance of these recombination catalysts can be elucidated through an electronic structure analysis, which primarily relies on the electron-donating capacity and synergistic effects between transition metals and sub-metals. These results provide theoretical guidance for designing new ORR and OER catalysts using 2D MXene materials.</description>

                Ni-Fe-based catalysts are considered to be among the most active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, with Fe playing a crucial role. However, Fe leaching occurs during the reaction due to thermodynamic instability, which has resulted in conflicting reports within the literature regarding its role. To clarify this point, we propose a strategy consisting of modulating the electronic orbital occupancy to suppress the extensive loss of Fe atoms during the OER process. Theoretical calculations, in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and a series of characterization showed that the stable presence of Fe not only accelerates the electron transfer process but also optimizes the reaction barriers of the oxygen evolution intermediates, promoting the phase transition of Fe5Ni4S8 to highly active catalytic species. The modulated Fe5Ni4S8-based pre-catalysts exhibit improved OER activity and long-term durability. This study provides a novel perspective for understanding the role of Fe in the OER process.</description>

                Hollow structures with hierarchical architecture and multi-composition have attracted extensive interest because of their fascinating physicochemical properties as well as wide applications. to improve the efficiency of overall water splitting, highly active and stable electrocatalysts are highly desirable. A novel high-efficiency Hierarchical hollow nanosheet-based-nanosphere Co-NiMoO4-HNS electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution was arranged by doping Co on Ni-MoEG yolk/shelll nanosphere. Remarkably, the hierarchical hollow Co2-NiMoO4-HNS catalyst exhibits favorable catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a receivable overpotential of 270 mV achieving a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec&#8722;1. In expansion, as a electrocatalyst, Co2-NiMo4-HNS appeared to have great long-term steadiness in the electrolyte. This work may give broad hypothetical and specialized back for the plan of cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                Development of high-activity and low-cost electrocatalysts is significant to enhance the low-kinetic process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we utilized the self-assembly between melamine, phytic acid and cobalt ions to obtain two-dimensional Co-MPA. Subsequently, in situ phosphating of Co ions to obtain CoP/N-CNT was achieved by the pyrolytic of Co-MPA. The small size of CoP (~18 nm) and the N-doped carbon material endowed CoP/N-CNT with excellent OER electrocatalytic activity, which delivered an overpotential of 285 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the TOF value of CoP/N-CNT catalyst is 4.6 times higher than the incumbent commercial RuO2 catalyst (at the overpotential of 480 mV), providing it as a promising electrocatalyst for OER.</description>

                A thin&#8208;film materials library (ML) of the La&#8211;Co&#8211;Mn&#8211;O system is fabricated by hot reactive combinatorial cosputter deposition and screened for its electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. Within this ML, an area with superior catalytic activity is identified. In&#8208;depth characterization of this region reveals a unique columnar&#8208;grown microstructure showing a large catalytic surface and excellent stability during electrocatalytic measurements. A zoom&#8208;in into these structures shows that the columns are compositionally and structurally not homogeneous but are composed of a mixture of the perovskite phase LaCoMnO 3 and Co&#8211;Mn&#8211;O oxide. Nanoelectrochemistry using the particle on a nanoelectrode approach confirms the high activity as well as stability of the single columns.</description>

      <title>Surface Addition of Ag on Pbo2 to Enable Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Ph-Neutral Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4697150</link>

                Developing a catalyst with high pH-neutral performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable due to its mild corrosion, low pollution, and ability to maintain system efficiency while reducing operating costs. However, the current earth-abundant metal oxide electrocatalysts developed for OER have poor performance in neutral media. This study introduces a novel strategy for fabricating a PbO2+Ag composite electrode with significantly improved OER activity and stability in a pH-neutral environment. Our results suggest that incorporating Ag as a surface additive improves the efficiency of utilizing absorbed oxygenated species via the bridge-site-top-site pathway. This effect is particularly pronounced in pH-neutral solutions where the concentration of hydroxyl is significantly limited. Furthermore, the surface decoration of Ag resulted in enhanced electrocatalytic stability. The results not only establish a method for utilizing PbO2 in pH-neutral OER applications, but also propose a potential strategy for employing less noble catalysts in cost-effective electrochemical energy conversions.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in electrochemical conversion, which needs efficient and economical electrocatalyst to boost its kinetics for large-scale application. Herein, a bimetallic CoP/FeP2 heterostructure with a three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure (3DOM-CoP/FeP2) was synthesized as an OER catalyst to demonstrate a heterogeneous engineering induction strategy. By adjusting the electron distribution and producing a lot of active sites, the heterogeneous interface enhances catalytic performance. High specific surface area is provided by the 3DOM structure. Additionally, at the solid-gas-electrolyte threephase interface, the electrocatalytic reaction exhibits good mass transfer. In-situ Raman spectroscopy characterization revealed that FeOOH and CoOOH reconstructed from CoP/FeP2 were the true OER active sites. Consequently, the 3DOM-CoP/FeP2 demonstrates superior OER activity with a low overpotentials of 300/420 mV at 10/100 mA cm&#8211;2 and meritorious OER durability. It also reveals promising performance as the overall water splitting anode.&amp;#xD;</description>
