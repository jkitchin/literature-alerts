      <title>Interfacial Electronic Redistribution via Anionic Modulator for Superb and Highly Stable Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07364</link>
      <description>Jiawen Cui, Junzhi Li, Xu Zhao, Guichen Gao, Ming Ya, Haitong Tang, Mingrui Wang, Dongdong Li, Guangshe Li, Guangshe Li, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390543671

                Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

      <title>Reinforced electrochemical energy storage through controlled construction of hierarchical hollow &#946;-Ni(OH)2 microspheres enriched with oxygen vacancies induced by functionalized MWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159331</link>
      <description>Zhi-Jia Sun, J. Chen, Xiao&#8208;Man Cao, Hao Ge, Daliang Liu, Qiong Wu, Xi&#8208;Ming Song, Applied Surface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390636146

                As promising electrode materials, hollow-structured metallic oxides/hydroxides have attracted extensive attention for their significantly enhanced catalyst and electrochemical performances. In practice, however, it is still challenging to construct well-dispersed hollow structures using facile and versatile template-free methods. And, as a result of the weak conductivity of most metallic oxides/hydroxides, it is a particularly effective means to integrate metallic oxides/hydroxides with carbon-based conductive substrates or introduce oxygen vacancies for further promoting reaction kinetics and achieving boosted electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel composite material consisting of oxygen-rich vacancy &#946;-Ni(OH)2 coupled with oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (Ov-N&#946;/Cm) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal technique without the need for templates. The hierarchical hollow microsphere structure was achieved by utilizing oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an alternative to conventional surfactants or templates. The uniform distribution of multistage pores in the newly designed Ov-N&#946;/Cm composite facilitates the transportation of electrolyte ions, thereby endowing it with outstanding electrochemical performance. A straightforward technique for producing high-quality Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials is presented in this investigation, along with fresh perspectives on the formation mechanism of hollow-structured composites. Developing MWCNT-based hollow nanostructured composites with oxygen vacancies-enriched will offer an essential novel avenue to exploit excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Spray Pyrolysis Regulated FeCo Alloy Anchoring on Nitrogen&#8211;Doped Carbon Hollow Spheres Boost the Performance of Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202310318</link>
      <description>Hong-Rui Huang, Qianqian Liang, Huajun Guo, Zhixing Wang, Guochun Yan, Feixiang Wu, Jiexi Wang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390637300

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalysts are the key to promoting the commercial application of metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy anchoring on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon hollow sphere (Fe x Co 1&#8208;x /N&#8208;C) is intelligently designed by spray pyrolysis (SP). The zinc in the SP&#8208;derived metal oxides and metal&#8208;organic framework volatilize at high temperature to construct a hierarchical porous structure with abundant defects and fully exposes the FeCo nanoparticles which uniformly anchor on the carbon substrate. In this structure, the coexistence of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy and binary metal active sites (Fe&#8208;N x /Co&#8208;N x ) guarantees the Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 /N&#8208;C catalyst exhibiting an excellent half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 &#9552; 0.84 V) superior to 20% Pt/C for ORR and a suppressed overpotential (280 mV) than RuO 2 for OER. Assembled rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery (RZAB) demonstrates a promising specific capacity of 807.02 mAh g &#8722;1 , peak power density of 159.08 mW cm &#8722;2 and durability without electrolyte circulation (550 h). This work proposes the design concept of utilizing an oxide core to in situ consume the porous carbon shell for anchoring metal active sites and construct defects, which benefits from spray pyrolysis in achieving precise control of the alloy structure and mass preparation.</description>

      <title>Constructing delocalized electronic structures to motivate the oxygen reduction activity of zinc selenide for high-performance zinc-air battery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148598</link>
      <description>Lei Yang, Xiuyun Yao, Changliang Du, Zhanli Han, Mingwei Jin, Shichao Peng, Xiaoqing Ma, Youqi Zhu, Meishuai Zou, Chuanbao Cao, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390651045

                Rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) typically necessitates highly efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been demonstrated as a superior energy storage material due to its unique electronic structure for various energy-related applications but is still rarely developed in electrocatalysis field. Herein, the efficient interfacial engineering is reported to motivate and sufficiently boost the ORR performances of ZnSe to an unprecedented level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of robust Se-C interactions and N species regulation could efficiently modulate the local electronic structure of ZnSe and improve the interaction with oxygen-containing intermediate, thus producing lower reaction energy barrier of O2 &#8594; OOH* conversion. The optimized ZnSe@PNC catalyst manifests remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries with ZnSe@PNC cathodes show large peak power density (126 mW cm&#8722;2), high specific capacity (818 mAh/g) and long cycling life (200 h). This work provides more possibilities for the electrocatalytic applications of nonprecious metal selenide electrocatalyst for future energy storage.</description>

      <title>In-based coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons with abundant CoP nanoparticles in carbon nanotubes for water oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0185031</link>
      <description>X.-F. Wang, Yuanyuan Guo, Yanqiong Shen, Jinjie Qian, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390670646

                The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall electrocatalytic water splitting poses a significant challenge in hydrogen production. A series of transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising electrocatalysts, effectively modulating the charge distribution of surrounding atoms for OER. In this study, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (CoP-CNR-CNT) was successfully synthesized through the pyrolysis and phosphatization of a Co-doped In-based coordination polymer, specifically InOF-25. This process resulted in evenly dispersed CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons. The synthesized CoP-CNR-CNT demonstrated a competitive OER activity with a smaller overpotential (&#951;10) of 295.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a satisfactory long-term stability compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 (&#951;10 = 353.7 mV). The high OER activity and stability can be attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon network, the abundance of CoP particles, and the intricate nanostructure of nanoribbons/nanotubes. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design and facile preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts from inorganic-organic coordination polymers, with potential applications in various energy conversion and storage systems.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

      <title>Ruthenium-anchored aminated MWCNTs/polyaniline membrane electrode assembly for alkaline water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118027</link>

                Here, we present a ruthenium-anchored aminated multi-walled carbon nanotube-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting (Ru@AM-MWCNTs). The method involves functionalizing MWCNTs before stabilising the ruthenium active sites. The prepared Ru@AM-MWCNTs displayed a low overpotential of 67 mV for HER on a glassy carbon electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, to promote the OER activity, Ru@AM-MWCNTs is sintered at 300 &#176;C which reflected the OER at 283 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2. The MEA made up of free-standing polyaniline and Ru@AM-MWCNTs as cathode and T-Ru@AM-MWCNTs as anode on nickel foam, achieved 80 % faradic efficiency for water splitting. In a 1 M KOH, it maintained a current density of 0.51 Acm&#8722;2 for 30 h at an onset potential of 2 V, surpassing the Neosepta membrane's performance under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the produced oxygen is 98 % pure, demonstrating the MEA's excellent potential for green hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Leveraging phosphate group in Pd/PdO decorated nickel phosphate microflowers via pulsed laser for robust hydrogen production in hydrazine-assisted electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.029</link>
      <description>Hyeyeon Lee, Jayaraman Theerthagiri, M.L. Aruna Kumari, Ahreum Min, Cheol Joo Moon, V. Anbazhagan, Richard L. Brutchey, Myong Yong Choi, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390683852

                By driving the electrooxidation of small molecules instead of relying on sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), low-input voltage is obtained for overall water splitting (OWS) and hydrogen generation, requiring active electrocatalysts. Using single-step pulsed laser irradiation, strong metal-support interaction is achieved on Pd/PdO-decorated Ni3(PO4)2&#183;8H2O (NiPh) microflowers, yielding an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR). When Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 serves as both anode and cathode in the OWS electrolyzer (OER||HER), a cell voltage of 2.098 V achieves 10 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M KOH. When evaluated in the hydrazine-coupled electrolyzer (HzOR||HER), Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 exhibits remarkable stability with a low cell voltage of 0.538 V in 0.5 M-N2H4/1.0 M-KOH, which is approximately 1.56 V lower than that of the traditional water electrolyzers. In Pd/PdO-NiPh, the empty 4s and 5s orbitals of Ni2+ and Pd, respectively, serve as two absorption sites. These sites facilitate chemisorption on the electrocatalyst surface by forming a two-electron dipolar bond between the lone-pair electrons of NH2 groups in N2H4 and Ni2+ as well as Pd. A feasible strategy for utilizing Pd/PdO-NiPh catalysts in developing direct N2H4 fuel cells is investigated in this work, enabling the simultaneous production of robust energy-saving H2 fuel and electricity.</description>

      <description>Fusheng Wen, Le Pang, Tao Zhang, Xiaoli Huang, Changdi Li, Hailong Liu, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390683992

                Developing clean energy sources is vital amid the global energy crisis. Hydrogen, emerging as a sustainable energy vector via water electrolysis, mandates adept catalysts owing to the sluggish electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a three-step synthesis of Fe-doped NiS2 catalyst from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By encapsulating with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) armor derived from polypyrrole (PPy) through thermal annealing, a novel Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC catalyst is achieved for improving the OER performance. The Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC demonstrates outstanding prowess, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential as modest as 255 mV, accompanied with a Tafel slope of only 77 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, it maintains operational stability for over 40 h under demanding conditions of 50 mA cm&#8722;2, displaying an impressive durability compared to the pure NiS2 catalyst. This work combines Fe-doping in NiS2 and PPy-derived NC encapsulation, achieving a dual enhancement of activity and stability of the catalyst. And this strategy also offers a feasible pathway to simultaneously boost the activity and stability in OER electrocatalysts, significantly contributing to clean energy solutions and providing ideas for future research.</description>

                MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 spinel oxide was synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel technique, followed by heat treatment at various temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 &#176;C). The prepared materials were examined as anode electrocatalysts for water-splitting systems in alkaline environments. Solid-state characterization methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), were used to analyze the materials&#8217; crystallographic structure and surface characteristics. The intrinsic activity of the MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 was fine-tuned by altering the electronic structure by controlling the calcination temperature, and the highest activity was observed for the sample treated at 800 &#176;C. A shift in the valence state of surface cations under oxidative conditions in an alkaline solution during the oxygen evolution reaction was detected through ex situ XAS measurements. Moreover, the influence of the experimental conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of the material, including the pH of the electrolyte and the temperature, was demonstrated.</description>

                This study focuses on exploring alternative catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in renewable fuel production, emphasizing the potential of multi-metal oxides derived from Earth-abundant metals and perovskites. The research integrates traditional experiments with machine learning and theoretical investigations, utilizing descriptors like oxygen p-band center (Op) and metal d-band center (Md). Through high-throughput calculations and crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), the study screens a large compositional space of perovskites and predicts Op/Md for 149,952 perovskites, highlighting elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 as promising for OER active materials. Notably, an analysis of the elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 revealed higher proportions of Ca, Sr, and Ba on the A-site, and Mo, Ni, and Fe on the B-site. This descriptor-based machine learning approach demonstrates its power for predicting promising perovskite OER candidates.</description>

                Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis.</description>

                Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and robust performance for large-scale seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen holds immense significance. Herein, a highly active bifunctional electrode composed of amorphous cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (CoFeLDH) and crystalline nickel phosphide (Ni2P) (denoted as CoFeLDH@Ni2P), is employed to boost hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis. The strong interface coupling effectively modifies the electronic structure at active sites, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. Impressively, in situ Raman and post-stability analyses demonstrate a unique reconstruction behavior on the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode. Bimetal co-incorporated NiOOH (CoFe-NiOOH) and Ni(OH)2 species are formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while CoFeLDH@Ni2P can transform into Ni(OH)2 species during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Furthermore, the highly negatively charged surface selectively rejects Cl- ions by formed PO43-, endowing CoFeLDH@Ni2P with excellent tolerance and promising durability in saline electrolytes. Consequently, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 and 308 mV for OER to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Additionally, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P(+,-) electrolyzer requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH + Seasalt. This work presents an appealing strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with amorphous-crystalline interfaces, which reveals the source of the activity of transition-metal phosphating compounds in saline water electrolysis.</description>

                Developing dual-function electrocatalysts that improve oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and durability is strongly desirable but still challenging. Herein, ultrasmall Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into hollow hierarchically porous Fe, N-codoped carbon spheres (denoted as Co/Fe-NC) are prepared through one-step pyrolysis of trimetallic ZnCoFe-ZIFs composites. The hierarchically porous structure of Co/Fe-NC demonstrates that the micropores possess strong capability to O2 capture and contribute large specific surface area, the mesopores provide numerous channels for the electrolyte infiltration, and the hollow holes allow more available active sites when used as cathodes of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Consequently, the optimized Co/Fe-NC catalyst demonstrates satisfactory activities with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and onset potential (E0 = 1.04 V), higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (E0 = 0.90 V and E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR. Moreover, a rechargeable ZAB assembled by the Co/Fe-NC electrode displays a large specific capacity of 836.2 mA h g&#8211;1, a power density of 136 mW cm&#8211;2, and excellent durability (maintaining 99% of its initial activity after 1195 cycles). The outstanding catalytic activity of the Co/Fe-NC is attributed to its multicomponent active dopants (Co, Fe, and N), and hollow hierarchical porous nanostructure.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Abstract Despite their great promise as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries, the extensive use of lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O 2 ) batteries is constrained by the slow kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. To increase the overall performance of Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, it is essential to increase the efficiency of oxygen electrode reactions by constructing effective electrocatalysts. As a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, high entropy perovskite oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 )(Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Cr 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 (referred to as LS(MFCCN)O 3 ) is designed and investigated in this article. The introduction of dissimilar metals in LS(MFCCN)O 3 has the potential to cause lattice deformation, thereby enhancing electron transfer between transition metal ions and facilitating the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies. This feature is advantageous for the reversible production and breakdown of discharge product Li 2 O 2 . Consequently, the Li&#8208;O 2 battery utilizing LS(MFCCN)O 3 as a catalyst achieves an impressive discharge capacity of 17,078.2 mAh g &#8722;1 and exhibits an extended cycling life of 435 cycles. This study offers a useful method for adjusting the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides toward oxygen redox reactions in Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Modulation of Dual-Monodispersed Pt&#8211;Ni3S2 as Efficacious Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Concurrent H2 Evolution and Methanol Selective Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01282-4</link>

                Constructing the efficacious and applicable bi-functional electrocatalysts and establishing out the mechanisms of organic electro-oxidation by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical to the development of electrochemically-driven technologies for efficient hydrogen production and avoid CO2 emission. Herein, the hetero-nanocrystals between monodispersed Pt (~ 2 nm) and Ni3S2 (~ 9.6 nm) are constructed as active electrocatalysts through interfacial electronic modulation, which exhibit superior bi-functional activities for methanol selective oxidation and H2 generation. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the asymmetrical charge distribution at Pt-Ni3S2 could be modulated by the electronic interaction at the interface of dual-monodispersed heterojunctions, which thus promote the adsorption/desorption of the chemical intermediates at the interface. As a result, the selective conversion from CH3OH to formate is accomplished at very low potentials (1.45 V) to attain 100 mA cm-2 with high electronic utilization rate (~ 98%) and without CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the Pt-Ni3S2 can simultaneously exhibit a broad potential window with outstanding stability and large current densities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Further, the excellent bi-functional performance is also indicated in the coupled methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)//HER reactor by only requiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with good reusability.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting offers the potential for environmentally friendly hydrogen and oxygen gas generation. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analyses of four organic polymers where metalloporphyrins are the active center nodes. These materials were obtained from the polymerization reaction of poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA) with the respective amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, where M = Fe, 1; Co, 2; Ni, 3; Cu, 4. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images (SEM and TEM) show that these polymers exhibit a layer-type morphology, which is attributed to hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking between the metalloporphyrin nodes. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Among the materials studied, the cobalt-based polymer, 2, demonstrates a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions with overpotentials (&#951;10) of 337 mV and 435 mV, respectively. The Fe, 1, and Ni, 2, polymers are less active for HER with maximum current densities (jmax) of 12.6 and 19.1 mA cm-2 and &#951;10 678 mV, 644 mV. Polymer 2 achieves a jmax of 37.7 mA cm-2 for HER and 133 mA cm-2 for OER. The copper-based material, 4, on the other hand, shows selectivity towards HER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 436 mV and a maximum current density (j) of 45.5 mA cm-2. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance was tested in the overall water-splitting setup, where polymer 2 requires a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a novel approach to heterogenized molecular systems, providing materials with exceptional structural characteristics and enhanced electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

                Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown its effectiveness as a cathode material for in situ ROS generation. Here, we present an electrochemically modified GAC cathode using electrode polarity reversal (PR) approach for enhanced H2O2 decomposition via 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). The successful GAC modification using PR necessitates tuning of the operational parameters such as frequency, current, and time intervals between the PR cycles. This modification enhances the GAC hydrophilicity by increasing the density of surface oxygen functionalities. After optimization of the electrode polarity, using the 20 (No PR)-2 (PR) interval and 140 mA current intensity, the &#8226;OH concentration reaches 38.9 &#956;M compared to the control (No PR) (28.14 &#956;M). Subsequently, we evaluated the enhanced &#8226;OH generation for the removal of glyphosate, a persistent pesticide used as a model contaminant. The modified GAC using PR removed 67.6% of glyphosate compared to 40.6% by the unmodified GAC without PR, respectively. The findings from this study will advance the utilization of GAC for in situ ROS synthesis, which will have direct implications on increasing the effectiveness of electrochemical water treatment systems.</description>

                The controlled cation substitution is an effective strategy for optimizing the density of states and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxide catalysts for water splitting. However, achieving tailored mesoporosity while maintaining elemental homogeneity and phase purity remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming for complex multi-metal oxides. In this study, we utilized a one-step impregnation nanocasting method for synthesizing mesoporous Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-substituted cobalt spinel oxide (Mn0.1Fe0.1Ni0.3Co2.5O4, MFNCO) and demonstrate the benefits of low-temperature calcination within a semi-sealed container at 150&#8211;200 &#176;C. The comprehensive discussion of calcination temperature effects on porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and catalytic performance for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highlights the importance of humidity, which was modulated by a pre-drying step. The catalyst calcined at 170 &#176;C exhibited the lowest overpotential (335 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), highest current density (433 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and further displayed excellent stability over 22 h (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, we successfully adapted this method to utilize cheap, commercially available silica gel as a hard template, yielding comparable OER performance. Our results represent a significant advance in the cost-efficient large-scale preparation of complex multi-metal oxides for catalytic applications.</description>

                Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

                As promising electrode materials, hollow-structured metallic oxides/hydroxides have attracted extensive attention for their significantly enhanced catalyst and electrochemical performances. In practice, however, it is still challenging to construct well-dispersed hollow structures using facile and versatile template-free methods. And, as a result of the weak conductivity of most metallic oxides/hydroxides, it is a particularly effective means to integrate metallic oxides/hydroxides with carbon-based conductive substrates or introduce oxygen vacancies for further promoting reaction kinetics and achieving boosted electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel composite material consisting of oxygen-rich vacancy &#946;-Ni(OH)2 coupled with oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (Ov-N&#946;/Cm) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal technique without the need for templates. The hierarchical hollow microsphere structure was achieved by utilizing oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an alternative to conventional surfactants or templates. The uniform distribution of multistage pores in the newly designed Ov-N&#946;/Cm composite facilitates the transportation of electrolyte ions, thereby endowing it with outstanding electrochemical performance. A straightforward technique for producing high-quality Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials is presented in this investigation, along with fresh perspectives on the formation mechanism of hollow-structured composites. Developing MWCNT-based hollow nanostructured composites with oxygen vacancies-enriched will offer an essential novel avenue to exploit excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage systems.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalysts are the key to promoting the commercial application of metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy anchoring on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon hollow sphere (Fe x Co 1&#8208;x /N&#8208;C) is intelligently designed by spray pyrolysis (SP). The zinc in the SP&#8208;derived metal oxides and metal&#8208;organic framework volatilize at high temperature to construct a hierarchical porous structure with abundant defects and fully exposes the FeCo nanoparticles which uniformly anchor on the carbon substrate. In this structure, the coexistence of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy and binary metal active sites (Fe&#8208;N x /Co&#8208;N x ) guarantees the Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 /N&#8208;C catalyst exhibiting an excellent half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 &#9552; 0.84 V) superior to 20% Pt/C for ORR and a suppressed overpotential (280 mV) than RuO 2 for OER. Assembled rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery (RZAB) demonstrates a promising specific capacity of 807.02 mAh g &#8722;1 , peak power density of 159.08 mW cm &#8722;2 and durability without electrolyte circulation (550 h). This work proposes the design concept of utilizing an oxide core to in situ consume the porous carbon shell for anchoring metal active sites and construct defects, which benefits from spray pyrolysis in achieving precise control of the alloy structure and mass preparation.</description>

                Rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) typically necessitates highly efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been demonstrated as a superior energy storage material due to its unique electronic structure for various energy-related applications but is still rarely developed in electrocatalysis field. Herein, the efficient interfacial engineering is reported to motivate and sufficiently boost the ORR performances of ZnSe to an unprecedented level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of robust Se-C interactions and N species regulation could efficiently modulate the local electronic structure of ZnSe and improve the interaction with oxygen-containing intermediate, thus producing lower reaction energy barrier of O2 &#8594; OOH* conversion. The optimized ZnSe@PNC catalyst manifests remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries with ZnSe@PNC cathodes show large peak power density (126 mW cm&#8722;2), high specific capacity (818 mAh/g) and long cycling life (200 h). This work provides more possibilities for the electrocatalytic applications of nonprecious metal selenide electrocatalyst for future energy storage.</description>

                The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall electrocatalytic water splitting poses a significant challenge in hydrogen production. A series of transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising electrocatalysts, effectively modulating the charge distribution of surrounding atoms for OER. In this study, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (CoP-CNR-CNT) was successfully synthesized through the pyrolysis and phosphatization of a Co-doped In-based coordination polymer, specifically InOF-25. This process resulted in evenly dispersed CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons. The synthesized CoP-CNR-CNT demonstrated a competitive OER activity with a smaller overpotential (&#951;10) of 295.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a satisfactory long-term stability compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 (&#951;10 = 353.7 mV). The high OER activity and stability can be attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon network, the abundance of CoP particles, and the intricate nanostructure of nanoribbons/nanotubes. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design and facile preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts from inorganic-organic coordination polymers, with potential applications in various energy conversion and storage systems.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Here, we present a ruthenium-anchored aminated multi-walled carbon nanotube-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting (Ru@AM-MWCNTs). The method involves functionalizing MWCNTs before stabilising the ruthenium active sites. The prepared Ru@AM-MWCNTs displayed a low overpotential of 67 mV for HER on a glassy carbon electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, to promote the OER activity, Ru@AM-MWCNTs is sintered at 300 &#176;C which reflected the OER at 283 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2. The MEA made up of free-standing polyaniline and Ru@AM-MWCNTs as cathode and T-Ru@AM-MWCNTs as anode on nickel foam, achieved 80 % faradic efficiency for water splitting. In a 1 M KOH, it maintained a current density of 0.51 Acm&#8722;2 for 30 h at an onset potential of 2 V, surpassing the Neosepta membrane's performance under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the produced oxygen is 98 % pure, demonstrating the MEA's excellent potential for green hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Leveraging phosphate group in Pd/PdO decorated nickel phosphate microflowers via pulsed laser for robust hydrogen production in hydrazine-assisted electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.029</link>
      <description>Hyeyeon Lee, Jayaraman Theerthagiri, M.L. Aruna Kumari, Ahreum Min, Cheol Joo Moon, V. Anbazhagan, Richard L. Brutchey, Myong Yong Choi, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390683852

                By driving the electrooxidation of small molecules instead of relying on sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), low-input voltage is obtained for overall water splitting (OWS) and hydrogen generation, requiring active electrocatalysts. Using single-step pulsed laser irradiation, strong metal-support interaction is achieved on Pd/PdO-decorated Ni3(PO4)2&#183;8H2O (NiPh) microflowers, yielding an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR). When Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 serves as both anode and cathode in the OWS electrolyzer (OER||HER), a cell voltage of 2.098 V achieves 10 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M KOH. When evaluated in the hydrazine-coupled electrolyzer (HzOR||HER), Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 exhibits remarkable stability with a low cell voltage of 0.538 V in 0.5 M-N2H4/1.0 M-KOH, which is approximately 1.56 V lower than that of the traditional water electrolyzers. In Pd/PdO-NiPh, the empty 4s and 5s orbitals of Ni2+ and Pd, respectively, serve as two absorption sites. These sites facilitate chemisorption on the electrocatalyst surface by forming a two-electron dipolar bond between the lone-pair electrons of NH2 groups in N2H4 and Ni2+ as well as Pd. A feasible strategy for utilizing Pd/PdO-NiPh catalysts in developing direct N2H4 fuel cells is investigated in this work, enabling the simultaneous production of robust energy-saving H2 fuel and electricity.</description>

                Developing clean energy sources is vital amid the global energy crisis. Hydrogen, emerging as a sustainable energy vector via water electrolysis, mandates adept catalysts owing to the sluggish electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a three-step synthesis of Fe-doped NiS2 catalyst from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By encapsulating with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) armor derived from polypyrrole (PPy) through thermal annealing, a novel Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC catalyst is achieved for improving the OER performance. The Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC demonstrates outstanding prowess, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential as modest as 255 mV, accompanied with a Tafel slope of only 77 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, it maintains operational stability for over 40 h under demanding conditions of 50 mA cm&#8722;2, displaying an impressive durability compared to the pure NiS2 catalyst. This work combines Fe-doping in NiS2 and PPy-derived NC encapsulation, achieving a dual enhancement of activity and stability of the catalyst. And this strategy also offers a feasible pathway to simultaneously boost the activity and stability in OER electrocatalysts, significantly contributing to clean energy solutions and providing ideas for future research.</description>

                MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 spinel oxide was synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel technique, followed by heat treatment at various temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 &#176;C). The prepared materials were examined as anode electrocatalysts for water-splitting systems in alkaline environments. Solid-state characterization methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), were used to analyze the materials&#8217; crystallographic structure and surface characteristics. The intrinsic activity of the MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 was fine-tuned by altering the electronic structure by controlling the calcination temperature, and the highest activity was observed for the sample treated at 800 &#176;C. A shift in the valence state of surface cations under oxidative conditions in an alkaline solution during the oxygen evolution reaction was detected through ex situ XAS measurements. Moreover, the influence of the experimental conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of the material, including the pH of the electrolyte and the temperature, was demonstrated.</description>

                This study focuses on exploring alternative catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in renewable fuel production, emphasizing the potential of multi-metal oxides derived from Earth-abundant metals and perovskites. The research integrates traditional experiments with machine learning and theoretical investigations, utilizing descriptors like oxygen p-band center (Op) and metal d-band center (Md). Through high-throughput calculations and crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), the study screens a large compositional space of perovskites and predicts Op/Md for 149,952 perovskites, highlighting elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 as promising for OER active materials. Notably, an analysis of the elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 revealed higher proportions of Ca, Sr, and Ba on the A-site, and Mo, Ni, and Fe on the B-site. This descriptor-based machine learning approach demonstrates its power for predicting promising perovskite OER candidates.</description>

                Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis.</description>

                Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and robust performance for large-scale seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen holds immense significance. Herein, a highly active bifunctional electrode composed of amorphous cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (CoFeLDH) and crystalline nickel phosphide (Ni2P) (denoted as CoFeLDH@Ni2P), is employed to boost hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis. The strong interface coupling effectively modifies the electronic structure at active sites, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. Impressively, in situ Raman and post-stability analyses demonstrate a unique reconstruction behavior on the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode. Bimetal co-incorporated NiOOH (CoFe-NiOOH) and Ni(OH)2 species are formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while CoFeLDH@Ni2P can transform into Ni(OH)2 species during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Furthermore, the highly negatively charged surface selectively rejects Cl- ions by formed PO43-, endowing CoFeLDH@Ni2P with excellent tolerance and promising durability in saline electrolytes. Consequently, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 and 308 mV for OER to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Additionally, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P(+,-) electrolyzer requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH + Seasalt. This work presents an appealing strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with amorphous-crystalline interfaces, which reveals the source of the activity of transition-metal phosphating compounds in saline water electrolysis.</description>

                Developing dual-function electrocatalysts that improve oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and durability is strongly desirable but still challenging. Herein, ultrasmall Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into hollow hierarchically porous Fe, N-codoped carbon spheres (denoted as Co/Fe-NC) are prepared through one-step pyrolysis of trimetallic ZnCoFe-ZIFs composites. The hierarchically porous structure of Co/Fe-NC demonstrates that the micropores possess strong capability to O2 capture and contribute large specific surface area, the mesopores provide numerous channels for the electrolyte infiltration, and the hollow holes allow more available active sites when used as cathodes of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Consequently, the optimized Co/Fe-NC catalyst demonstrates satisfactory activities with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and onset potential (E0 = 1.04 V), higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (E0 = 0.90 V and E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR. Moreover, a rechargeable ZAB assembled by the Co/Fe-NC electrode displays a large specific capacity of 836.2 mA h g&#8211;1, a power density of 136 mW cm&#8211;2, and excellent durability (maintaining 99% of its initial activity after 1195 cycles). The outstanding catalytic activity of the Co/Fe-NC is attributed to its multicomponent active dopants (Co, Fe, and N), and hollow hierarchical porous nanostructure.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Abstract Despite their great promise as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries, the extensive use of lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O 2 ) batteries is constrained by the slow kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. To increase the overall performance of Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, it is essential to increase the efficiency of oxygen electrode reactions by constructing effective electrocatalysts. As a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, high entropy perovskite oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 )(Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Cr 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 (referred to as LS(MFCCN)O 3 ) is designed and investigated in this article. The introduction of dissimilar metals in LS(MFCCN)O 3 has the potential to cause lattice deformation, thereby enhancing electron transfer between transition metal ions and facilitating the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies. This feature is advantageous for the reversible production and breakdown of discharge product Li 2 O 2 . Consequently, the Li&#8208;O 2 battery utilizing LS(MFCCN)O 3 as a catalyst achieves an impressive discharge capacity of 17,078.2 mAh g &#8722;1 and exhibits an extended cycling life of 435 cycles. This study offers a useful method for adjusting the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides toward oxygen redox reactions in Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Modulation of Dual-Monodispersed Pt&#8211;Ni3S2 as Efficacious Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Concurrent H2 Evolution and Methanol Selective Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01282-4</link>
      <description>Qianqian Zhao, Bin Zhao, Xin Long, Renfei Feng, Mohsen Shakouri, Alisa R. Paterson, Qunfeng Xiao, Yu Zhang, Xian&#8208;Zhu Fu, Jing&#8208;Li Luo, Nano-Micro Letters. 16(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390743659

                Constructing the efficacious and applicable bi-functional electrocatalysts and establishing out the mechanisms of organic electro-oxidation by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical to the development of electrochemically-driven technologies for efficient hydrogen production and avoid CO2 emission. Herein, the hetero-nanocrystals between monodispersed Pt (~ 2 nm) and Ni3S2 (~ 9.6 nm) are constructed as active electrocatalysts through interfacial electronic modulation, which exhibit superior bi-functional activities for methanol selective oxidation and H2 generation. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the asymmetrical charge distribution at Pt-Ni3S2 could be modulated by the electronic interaction at the interface of dual-monodispersed heterojunctions, which thus promote the adsorption/desorption of the chemical intermediates at the interface. As a result, the selective conversion from CH3OH to formate is accomplished at very low potentials (1.45 V) to attain 100 mA cm-2 with high electronic utilization rate (~ 98%) and without CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the Pt-Ni3S2 can simultaneously exhibit a broad potential window with outstanding stability and large current densities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Further, the excellent bi-functional performance is also indicated in the coupled methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)//HER reactor by only requiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with good reusability.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting offers the potential for environmentally friendly hydrogen and oxygen gas generation. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analyses of four organic polymers where metalloporphyrins are the active center nodes. These materials were obtained from the polymerization reaction of poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA) with the respective amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, where M = Fe, 1; Co, 2; Ni, 3; Cu, 4. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images (SEM and TEM) show that these polymers exhibit a layer-type morphology, which is attributed to hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking between the metalloporphyrin nodes. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Among the materials studied, the cobalt-based polymer, 2, demonstrates a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions with overpotentials (&#951;10) of 337 mV and 435 mV, respectively. The Fe, 1, and Ni, 2, polymers are less active for HER with maximum current densities (jmax) of 12.6 and 19.1 mA cm-2 and &#951;10 678 mV, 644 mV. Polymer 2 achieves a jmax of 37.7 mA cm-2 for HER and 133 mA cm-2 for OER. The copper-based material, 4, on the other hand, shows selectivity towards HER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 436 mV and a maximum current density (j) of 45.5 mA cm-2. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance was tested in the overall water-splitting setup, where polymer 2 requires a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a novel approach to heterogenized molecular systems, providing materials with exceptional structural characteristics and enhanced electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

                Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown its effectiveness as a cathode material for in situ ROS generation. Here, we present an electrochemically modified GAC cathode using electrode polarity reversal (PR) approach for enhanced H2O2 decomposition via 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). The successful GAC modification using PR necessitates tuning of the operational parameters such as frequency, current, and time intervals between the PR cycles. This modification enhances the GAC hydrophilicity by increasing the density of surface oxygen functionalities. After optimization of the electrode polarity, using the 20 (No PR)-2 (PR) interval and 140 mA current intensity, the &#8226;OH concentration reaches 38.9 &#956;M compared to the control (No PR) (28.14 &#956;M). Subsequently, we evaluated the enhanced &#8226;OH generation for the removal of glyphosate, a persistent pesticide used as a model contaminant. The modified GAC using PR removed 67.6% of glyphosate compared to 40.6% by the unmodified GAC without PR, respectively. The findings from this study will advance the utilization of GAC for in situ ROS synthesis, which will have direct implications on increasing the effectiveness of electrochemical water treatment systems.</description>

                The controlled cation substitution is an effective strategy for optimizing the density of states and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxide catalysts for water splitting. However, achieving tailored mesoporosity while maintaining elemental homogeneity and phase purity remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming for complex multi-metal oxides. In this study, we utilized a one-step impregnation nanocasting method for synthesizing mesoporous Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-substituted cobalt spinel oxide (Mn0.1Fe0.1Ni0.3Co2.5O4, MFNCO) and demonstrate the benefits of low-temperature calcination within a semi-sealed container at 150&#8211;200 &#176;C. The comprehensive discussion of calcination temperature effects on porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and catalytic performance for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highlights the importance of humidity, which was modulated by a pre-drying step. The catalyst calcined at 170 &#176;C exhibited the lowest overpotential (335 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), highest current density (433 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and further displayed excellent stability over 22 h (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, we successfully adapted this method to utilize cheap, commercially available silica gel as a hard template, yielding comparable OER performance. Our results represent a significant advance in the cost-efficient large-scale preparation of complex multi-metal oxides for catalytic applications.</description>

                Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

                As promising electrode materials, hollow-structured metallic oxides/hydroxides have attracted extensive attention for their significantly enhanced catalyst and electrochemical performances. In practice, however, it is still challenging to construct well-dispersed hollow structures using facile and versatile template-free methods. And, as a result of the weak conductivity of most metallic oxides/hydroxides, it is a particularly effective means to integrate metallic oxides/hydroxides with carbon-based conductive substrates or introduce oxygen vacancies for further promoting reaction kinetics and achieving boosted electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel composite material consisting of oxygen-rich vacancy &#946;-Ni(OH)2 coupled with oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (Ov-N&#946;/Cm) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal technique without the need for templates. The hierarchical hollow microsphere structure was achieved by utilizing oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an alternative to conventional surfactants or templates. The uniform distribution of multistage pores in the newly designed Ov-N&#946;/Cm composite facilitates the transportation of electrolyte ions, thereby endowing it with outstanding electrochemical performance. A straightforward technique for producing high-quality Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials is presented in this investigation, along with fresh perspectives on the formation mechanism of hollow-structured composites. Developing MWCNT-based hollow nanostructured composites with oxygen vacancies-enriched will offer an essential novel avenue to exploit excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage systems.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalysts are the key to promoting the commercial application of metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy anchoring on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon hollow sphere (Fe x Co 1&#8208;x /N&#8208;C) is intelligently designed by spray pyrolysis (SP). The zinc in the SP&#8208;derived metal oxides and metal&#8208;organic framework volatilize at high temperature to construct a hierarchical porous structure with abundant defects and fully exposes the FeCo nanoparticles which uniformly anchor on the carbon substrate. In this structure, the coexistence of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy and binary metal active sites (Fe&#8208;N x /Co&#8208;N x ) guarantees the Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 /N&#8208;C catalyst exhibiting an excellent half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 &#9552; 0.84 V) superior to 20% Pt/C for ORR and a suppressed overpotential (280 mV) than RuO 2 for OER. Assembled rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery (RZAB) demonstrates a promising specific capacity of 807.02 mAh g &#8722;1 , peak power density of 159.08 mW cm &#8722;2 and durability without electrolyte circulation (550 h). This work proposes the design concept of utilizing an oxide core to in situ consume the porous carbon shell for anchoring metal active sites and construct defects, which benefits from spray pyrolysis in achieving precise control of the alloy structure and mass preparation.</description>

      <description>Lei Yang, Xiuyun Yao, Changliang Du, Zhanli Han, Mingwei Jin, Shichao Peng, Xiaoqing Ma, Youqi Zhu, Meishuai Zou, Chuanbao Cao, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390651045

                Rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) typically necessitates highly efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been demonstrated as a superior energy storage material due to its unique electronic structure for various energy-related applications but is still rarely developed in electrocatalysis field. Herein, the efficient interfacial engineering is reported to motivate and sufficiently boost the ORR performances of ZnSe to an unprecedented level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of robust Se-C interactions and N species regulation could efficiently modulate the local electronic structure of ZnSe and improve the interaction with oxygen-containing intermediate, thus producing lower reaction energy barrier of O2 &#8594; OOH* conversion. The optimized ZnSe@PNC catalyst manifests remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries with ZnSe@PNC cathodes show large peak power density (126 mW cm&#8722;2), high specific capacity (818 mAh/g) and long cycling life (200 h). This work provides more possibilities for the electrocatalytic applications of nonprecious metal selenide electrocatalyst for future energy storage.</description>

                The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall electrocatalytic water splitting poses a significant challenge in hydrogen production. A series of transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising electrocatalysts, effectively modulating the charge distribution of surrounding atoms for OER. In this study, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (CoP-CNR-CNT) was successfully synthesized through the pyrolysis and phosphatization of a Co-doped In-based coordination polymer, specifically InOF-25. This process resulted in evenly dispersed CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons. The synthesized CoP-CNR-CNT demonstrated a competitive OER activity with a smaller overpotential (&#951;10) of 295.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a satisfactory long-term stability compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 (&#951;10 = 353.7 mV). The high OER activity and stability can be attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon network, the abundance of CoP particles, and the intricate nanostructure of nanoribbons/nanotubes. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design and facile preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts from inorganic-organic coordination polymers, with potential applications in various energy conversion and storage systems.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Here, we present a ruthenium-anchored aminated multi-walled carbon nanotube-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting (Ru@AM-MWCNTs). The method involves functionalizing MWCNTs before stabilising the ruthenium active sites. The prepared Ru@AM-MWCNTs displayed a low overpotential of 67 mV for HER on a glassy carbon electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, to promote the OER activity, Ru@AM-MWCNTs is sintered at 300 &#176;C which reflected the OER at 283 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2. The MEA made up of free-standing polyaniline and Ru@AM-MWCNTs as cathode and T-Ru@AM-MWCNTs as anode on nickel foam, achieved 80 % faradic efficiency for water splitting. In a 1 M KOH, it maintained a current density of 0.51 Acm&#8722;2 for 30 h at an onset potential of 2 V, surpassing the Neosepta membrane's performance under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the produced oxygen is 98 % pure, demonstrating the MEA's excellent potential for green hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Leveraging phosphate group in Pd/PdO decorated nickel phosphate microflowers via pulsed laser for robust hydrogen production in hydrazine-assisted electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.029</link>
      <description>Hyeyeon Lee, Jayaraman Theerthagiri, M.L. Aruna Kumari, Ahreum Min, Cheol Joo Moon, V. Anbazhagan, Richard L. Brutchey, Myong Yong Choi, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390683852

                By driving the electrooxidation of small molecules instead of relying on sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), low-input voltage is obtained for overall water splitting (OWS) and hydrogen generation, requiring active electrocatalysts. Using single-step pulsed laser irradiation, strong metal-support interaction is achieved on Pd/PdO-decorated Ni3(PO4)2&#183;8H2O (NiPh) microflowers, yielding an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR). When Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 serves as both anode and cathode in the OWS electrolyzer (OER||HER), a cell voltage of 2.098 V achieves 10 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M KOH. When evaluated in the hydrazine-coupled electrolyzer (HzOR||HER), Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 exhibits remarkable stability with a low cell voltage of 0.538 V in 0.5 M-N2H4/1.0 M-KOH, which is approximately 1.56 V lower than that of the traditional water electrolyzers. In Pd/PdO-NiPh, the empty 4s and 5s orbitals of Ni2+ and Pd, respectively, serve as two absorption sites. These sites facilitate chemisorption on the electrocatalyst surface by forming a two-electron dipolar bond between the lone-pair electrons of NH2 groups in N2H4 and Ni2+ as well as Pd. A feasible strategy for utilizing Pd/PdO-NiPh catalysts in developing direct N2H4 fuel cells is investigated in this work, enabling the simultaneous production of robust energy-saving H2 fuel and electricity.</description>

                Developing clean energy sources is vital amid the global energy crisis. Hydrogen, emerging as a sustainable energy vector via water electrolysis, mandates adept catalysts owing to the sluggish electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a three-step synthesis of Fe-doped NiS2 catalyst from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By encapsulating with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) armor derived from polypyrrole (PPy) through thermal annealing, a novel Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC catalyst is achieved for improving the OER performance. The Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC demonstrates outstanding prowess, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential as modest as 255 mV, accompanied with a Tafel slope of only 77 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, it maintains operational stability for over 40 h under demanding conditions of 50 mA cm&#8722;2, displaying an impressive durability compared to the pure NiS2 catalyst. This work combines Fe-doping in NiS2 and PPy-derived NC encapsulation, achieving a dual enhancement of activity and stability of the catalyst. And this strategy also offers a feasible pathway to simultaneously boost the activity and stability in OER electrocatalysts, significantly contributing to clean energy solutions and providing ideas for future research.</description>

                MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 spinel oxide was synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel technique, followed by heat treatment at various temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 &#176;C). The prepared materials were examined as anode electrocatalysts for water-splitting systems in alkaline environments. Solid-state characterization methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), were used to analyze the materials&#8217; crystallographic structure and surface characteristics. The intrinsic activity of the MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 was fine-tuned by altering the electronic structure by controlling the calcination temperature, and the highest activity was observed for the sample treated at 800 &#176;C. A shift in the valence state of surface cations under oxidative conditions in an alkaline solution during the oxygen evolution reaction was detected through ex situ XAS measurements. Moreover, the influence of the experimental conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of the material, including the pH of the electrolyte and the temperature, was demonstrated.</description>

                This study focuses on exploring alternative catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in renewable fuel production, emphasizing the potential of multi-metal oxides derived from Earth-abundant metals and perovskites. The research integrates traditional experiments with machine learning and theoretical investigations, utilizing descriptors like oxygen p-band center (Op) and metal d-band center (Md). Through high-throughput calculations and crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), the study screens a large compositional space of perovskites and predicts Op/Md for 149,952 perovskites, highlighting elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 as promising for OER active materials. Notably, an analysis of the elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 revealed higher proportions of Ca, Sr, and Ba on the A-site, and Mo, Ni, and Fe on the B-site. This descriptor-based machine learning approach demonstrates its power for predicting promising perovskite OER candidates.</description>

                Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis.</description>

                Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and robust performance for large-scale seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen holds immense significance. Herein, a highly active bifunctional electrode composed of amorphous cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (CoFeLDH) and crystalline nickel phosphide (Ni2P) (denoted as CoFeLDH@Ni2P), is employed to boost hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis. The strong interface coupling effectively modifies the electronic structure at active sites, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. Impressively, in situ Raman and post-stability analyses demonstrate a unique reconstruction behavior on the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode. Bimetal co-incorporated NiOOH (CoFe-NiOOH) and Ni(OH)2 species are formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while CoFeLDH@Ni2P can transform into Ni(OH)2 species during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Furthermore, the highly negatively charged surface selectively rejects Cl- ions by formed PO43-, endowing CoFeLDH@Ni2P with excellent tolerance and promising durability in saline electrolytes. Consequently, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 and 308 mV for OER to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Additionally, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P(+,-) electrolyzer requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH + Seasalt. This work presents an appealing strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with amorphous-crystalline interfaces, which reveals the source of the activity of transition-metal phosphating compounds in saline water electrolysis.</description>

                Developing dual-function electrocatalysts that improve oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and durability is strongly desirable but still challenging. Herein, ultrasmall Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into hollow hierarchically porous Fe, N-codoped carbon spheres (denoted as Co/Fe-NC) are prepared through one-step pyrolysis of trimetallic ZnCoFe-ZIFs composites. The hierarchically porous structure of Co/Fe-NC demonstrates that the micropores possess strong capability to O2 capture and contribute large specific surface area, the mesopores provide numerous channels for the electrolyte infiltration, and the hollow holes allow more available active sites when used as cathodes of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Consequently, the optimized Co/Fe-NC catalyst demonstrates satisfactory activities with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and onset potential (E0 = 1.04 V), higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (E0 = 0.90 V and E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR. Moreover, a rechargeable ZAB assembled by the Co/Fe-NC electrode displays a large specific capacity of 836.2 mA h g&#8211;1, a power density of 136 mW cm&#8211;2, and excellent durability (maintaining 99% of its initial activity after 1195 cycles). The outstanding catalytic activity of the Co/Fe-NC is attributed to its multicomponent active dopants (Co, Fe, and N), and hollow hierarchical porous nanostructure.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Abstract Despite their great promise as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries, the extensive use of lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O 2 ) batteries is constrained by the slow kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. To increase the overall performance of Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, it is essential to increase the efficiency of oxygen electrode reactions by constructing effective electrocatalysts. As a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, high entropy perovskite oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 )(Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Cr 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 (referred to as LS(MFCCN)O 3 ) is designed and investigated in this article. The introduction of dissimilar metals in LS(MFCCN)O 3 has the potential to cause lattice deformation, thereby enhancing electron transfer between transition metal ions and facilitating the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies. This feature is advantageous for the reversible production and breakdown of discharge product Li 2 O 2 . Consequently, the Li&#8208;O 2 battery utilizing LS(MFCCN)O 3 as a catalyst achieves an impressive discharge capacity of 17,078.2 mAh g &#8722;1 and exhibits an extended cycling life of 435 cycles. This study offers a useful method for adjusting the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides toward oxygen redox reactions in Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Modulation of Dual-Monodispersed Pt&#8211;Ni3S2 as Efficacious Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Concurrent H2 Evolution and Methanol Selective Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01282-4</link>
      <description>Qianqian Zhao, Bin Zhao, Xin Long, Renfei Feng, Mohsen Shakouri, Alisa R. Paterson, Qunfeng Xiao, Yu Zhang, Xian&#8208;Zhu Fu, Jing&#8208;Li Luo, Nano-Micro Letters. 16(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390743659

                Constructing the efficacious and applicable bi-functional electrocatalysts and establishing out the mechanisms of organic electro-oxidation by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical to the development of electrochemically-driven technologies for efficient hydrogen production and avoid CO2 emission. Herein, the hetero-nanocrystals between monodispersed Pt (~ 2 nm) and Ni3S2 (~ 9.6 nm) are constructed as active electrocatalysts through interfacial electronic modulation, which exhibit superior bi-functional activities for methanol selective oxidation and H2 generation. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the asymmetrical charge distribution at Pt-Ni3S2 could be modulated by the electronic interaction at the interface of dual-monodispersed heterojunctions, which thus promote the adsorption/desorption of the chemical intermediates at the interface. As a result, the selective conversion from CH3OH to formate is accomplished at very low potentials (1.45 V) to attain 100 mA cm-2 with high electronic utilization rate (~ 98%) and without CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the Pt-Ni3S2 can simultaneously exhibit a broad potential window with outstanding stability and large current densities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Further, the excellent bi-functional performance is also indicated in the coupled methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)//HER reactor by only requiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with good reusability.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting offers the potential for environmentally friendly hydrogen and oxygen gas generation. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analyses of four organic polymers where metalloporphyrins are the active center nodes. These materials were obtained from the polymerization reaction of poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA) with the respective amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, where M = Fe, 1; Co, 2; Ni, 3; Cu, 4. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images (SEM and TEM) show that these polymers exhibit a layer-type morphology, which is attributed to hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking between the metalloporphyrin nodes. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Among the materials studied, the cobalt-based polymer, 2, demonstrates a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions with overpotentials (&#951;10) of 337 mV and 435 mV, respectively. The Fe, 1, and Ni, 2, polymers are less active for HER with maximum current densities (jmax) of 12.6 and 19.1 mA cm-2 and &#951;10 678 mV, 644 mV. Polymer 2 achieves a jmax of 37.7 mA cm-2 for HER and 133 mA cm-2 for OER. The copper-based material, 4, on the other hand, shows selectivity towards HER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 436 mV and a maximum current density (j) of 45.5 mA cm-2. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance was tested in the overall water-splitting setup, where polymer 2 requires a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a novel approach to heterogenized molecular systems, providing materials with exceptional structural characteristics and enhanced electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Engineering Electrode Polarity for Enhancing In Situ Generation of Hydroxyl Radicals Using Granular Activated Carbon</title>

      <description>Stephanie Sarrouf, Amir Taqieddin, Muhammad Fahad Ehsan, Akram N. Alshawabkeh, Catalysts. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390751327

                Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown its effectiveness as a cathode material for in situ ROS generation. Here, we present an electrochemically modified GAC cathode using electrode polarity reversal (PR) approach for enhanced H2O2 decomposition via 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). The successful GAC modification using PR necessitates tuning of the operational parameters such as frequency, current, and time intervals between the PR cycles. This modification enhances the GAC hydrophilicity by increasing the density of surface oxygen functionalities. After optimization of the electrode polarity, using the 20 (No PR)-2 (PR) interval and 140 mA current intensity, the &#8226;OH concentration reaches 38.9 &#956;M compared to the control (No PR) (28.14 &#956;M). Subsequently, we evaluated the enhanced &#8226;OH generation for the removal of glyphosate, a persistent pesticide used as a model contaminant. The modified GAC using PR removed 67.6% of glyphosate compared to 40.6% by the unmodified GAC without PR, respectively. The findings from this study will advance the utilization of GAC for in situ ROS synthesis, which will have direct implications on increasing the effectiveness of electrochemical water treatment systems.</description>

                The controlled cation substitution is an effective strategy for optimizing the density of states and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxide catalysts for water splitting. However, achieving tailored mesoporosity while maintaining elemental homogeneity and phase purity remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming for complex multi-metal oxides. In this study, we utilized a one-step impregnation nanocasting method for synthesizing mesoporous Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-substituted cobalt spinel oxide (Mn0.1Fe0.1Ni0.3Co2.5O4, MFNCO) and demonstrate the benefits of low-temperature calcination within a semi-sealed container at 150&#8211;200 &#176;C. The comprehensive discussion of calcination temperature effects on porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and catalytic performance for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highlights the importance of humidity, which was modulated by a pre-drying step. The catalyst calcined at 170 &#176;C exhibited the lowest overpotential (335 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), highest current density (433 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and further displayed excellent stability over 22 h (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, we successfully adapted this method to utilize cheap, commercially available silica gel as a hard template, yielding comparable OER performance. Our results represent a significant advance in the cost-efficient large-scale preparation of complex multi-metal oxides for catalytic applications.</description>

                Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

                As promising electrode materials, hollow-structured metallic oxides/hydroxides have attracted extensive attention for their significantly enhanced catalyst and electrochemical performances. In practice, however, it is still challenging to construct well-dispersed hollow structures using facile and versatile template-free methods. And, as a result of the weak conductivity of most metallic oxides/hydroxides, it is a particularly effective means to integrate metallic oxides/hydroxides with carbon-based conductive substrates or introduce oxygen vacancies for further promoting reaction kinetics and achieving boosted electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel composite material consisting of oxygen-rich vacancy &#946;-Ni(OH)2 coupled with oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (Ov-N&#946;/Cm) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal technique without the need for templates. The hierarchical hollow microsphere structure was achieved by utilizing oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an alternative to conventional surfactants or templates. The uniform distribution of multistage pores in the newly designed Ov-N&#946;/Cm composite facilitates the transportation of electrolyte ions, thereby endowing it with outstanding electrochemical performance. A straightforward technique for producing high-quality Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials is presented in this investigation, along with fresh perspectives on the formation mechanism of hollow-structured composites. Developing MWCNT-based hollow nanostructured composites with oxygen vacancies-enriched will offer an essential novel avenue to exploit excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage systems.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalysts are the key to promoting the commercial application of metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy anchoring on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon hollow sphere (Fe x Co 1&#8208;x /N&#8208;C) is intelligently designed by spray pyrolysis (SP). The zinc in the SP&#8208;derived metal oxides and metal&#8208;organic framework volatilize at high temperature to construct a hierarchical porous structure with abundant defects and fully exposes the FeCo nanoparticles which uniformly anchor on the carbon substrate. In this structure, the coexistence of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy and binary metal active sites (Fe&#8208;N x /Co&#8208;N x ) guarantees the Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 /N&#8208;C catalyst exhibiting an excellent half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 &#9552; 0.84 V) superior to 20% Pt/C for ORR and a suppressed overpotential (280 mV) than RuO 2 for OER. Assembled rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery (RZAB) demonstrates a promising specific capacity of 807.02 mAh g &#8722;1 , peak power density of 159.08 mW cm &#8722;2 and durability without electrolyte circulation (550 h). This work proposes the design concept of utilizing an oxide core to in situ consume the porous carbon shell for anchoring metal active sites and construct defects, which benefits from spray pyrolysis in achieving precise control of the alloy structure and mass preparation.</description>

Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been demonstrated as a superior energy storage material due to its unique electronic structure for various energy-related applications but is still rarely developed in electrocatalysis field. Herein, the efficient interfacial engineering is reported to motivate and sufficiently boost the ORR performances of ZnSe to an unprecedented level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of robust Se-C interactions and N species regulation could efficiently modulate the local electronic structure of ZnSe and improve the interaction with oxygen-containing intermediate, thus producing lower reaction energy barrier of O2 &#8594; OOH* conversion. The optimized ZnSe@PNC catalyst manifests remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries with ZnSe@PNC cathodes show large peak power density (126 mW cm&#8722;2), high specific capacity (818 mAh/g) and long cycling life (200 h). This work provides more possibilities for the electrocatalytic applications of nonprecious metal selenide electrocatalyst for future energy storage.</description>

                The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall electrocatalytic water splitting poses a significant challenge in hydrogen production. A series of transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising electrocatalysts, effectively modulating the charge distribution of surrounding atoms for OER. In this study, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (CoP-CNR-CNT) was successfully synthesized through the pyrolysis and phosphatization of a Co-doped In-based coordination polymer, specifically InOF-25. This process resulted in evenly dispersed CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons. The synthesized CoP-CNR-CNT demonstrated a competitive OER activity with a smaller overpotential (&#951;10) of 295.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a satisfactory long-term stability compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 (&#951;10 = 353.7 mV). The high OER activity and stability can be attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon network, the abundance of CoP particles, and the intricate nanostructure of nanoribbons/nanotubes. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design and facile preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts from inorganic-organic coordination polymers, with potential applications in various energy conversion and storage systems.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Here, we present a ruthenium-anchored aminated multi-walled carbon nanotube-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting (Ru@AM-MWCNTs). The method involves functionalizing MWCNTs before stabilising the ruthenium active sites. The prepared Ru@AM-MWCNTs displayed a low overpotential of 67 mV for HER on a glassy carbon electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, to promote the OER activity, Ru@AM-MWCNTs is sintered at 300 &#176;C which reflected the OER at 283 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2. The MEA made up of free-standing polyaniline and Ru@AM-MWCNTs as cathode and T-Ru@AM-MWCNTs as anode on nickel foam, achieved 80 % faradic efficiency for water splitting. In a 1 M KOH, it maintained a current density of 0.51 Acm&#8722;2 for 30 h at an onset potential of 2 V, surpassing the Neosepta membrane's performance under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the produced oxygen is 98 % pure, demonstrating the MEA's excellent potential for green hydrogen production.</description>

                By driving the electrooxidation of small molecules instead of relying on sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), low-input voltage is obtained for overall water splitting (OWS) and hydrogen generation, requiring active electrocatalysts. Using single-step pulsed laser irradiation, strong metal-support interaction is achieved on Pd/PdO-decorated Ni3(PO4)2&#183;8H2O (NiPh) microflowers, yielding an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR). When Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 serves as both anode and cathode in the OWS electrolyzer (OER||HER), a cell voltage of 2.098 V achieves 10 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M KOH. When evaluated in the hydrazine-coupled electrolyzer (HzOR||HER), Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 exhibits remarkable stability with a low cell voltage of 0.538 V in 0.5 M-N2H4/1.0 M-KOH, which is approximately 1.56 V lower than that of the traditional water electrolyzers. In Pd/PdO-NiPh, the empty 4s and 5s orbitals of Ni2+ and Pd, respectively, serve as two absorption sites. These sites facilitate chemisorption on the electrocatalyst surface by forming a two-electron dipolar bond between the lone-pair electrons of NH2 groups in N2H4 and Ni2+ as well as Pd. A feasible strategy for utilizing Pd/PdO-NiPh catalysts in developing direct N2H4 fuel cells is investigated in this work, enabling the simultaneous production of robust energy-saving H2 fuel and electricity.</description>

                Developing clean energy sources is vital amid the global energy crisis. Hydrogen, emerging as a sustainable energy vector via water electrolysis, mandates adept catalysts owing to the sluggish electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a three-step synthesis of Fe-doped NiS2 catalyst from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By encapsulating with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) armor derived from polypyrrole (PPy) through thermal annealing, a novel Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC catalyst is achieved for improving the OER performance. The Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC demonstrates outstanding prowess, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential as modest as 255 mV, accompanied with a Tafel slope of only 77 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, it maintains operational stability for over 40 h under demanding conditions of 50 mA cm&#8722;2, displaying an impressive durability compared to the pure NiS2 catalyst. This work combines Fe-doping in NiS2 and PPy-derived NC encapsulation, achieving a dual enhancement of activity and stability of the catalyst. And this strategy also offers a feasible pathway to simultaneously boost the activity and stability in OER electrocatalysts, significantly contributing to clean energy solutions and providing ideas for future research.</description>

                MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 spinel oxide was synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel technique, followed by heat treatment at various temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 &#176;C). The prepared materials were examined as anode electrocatalysts for water-splitting systems in alkaline environments. Solid-state characterization methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), were used to analyze the materials&#8217; crystallographic structure and surface characteristics. The intrinsic activity of the MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 was fine-tuned by altering the electronic structure by controlling the calcination temperature, and the highest activity was observed for the sample treated at 800 &#176;C. A shift in the valence state of surface cations under oxidative conditions in an alkaline solution during the oxygen evolution reaction was detected through ex situ XAS measurements. Moreover, the influence of the experimental conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of the material, including the pH of the electrolyte and the temperature, was demonstrated.</description>

                This study focuses on exploring alternative catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in renewable fuel production, emphasizing the potential of multi-metal oxides derived from Earth-abundant metals and perovskites. The research integrates traditional experiments with machine learning and theoretical investigations, utilizing descriptors like oxygen p-band center (Op) and metal d-band center (Md). Through high-throughput calculations and crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), the study screens a large compositional space of perovskites and predicts Op/Md for 149,952 perovskites, highlighting elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 as promising for OER active materials. Notably, an analysis of the elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 revealed higher proportions of Ca, Sr, and Ba on the A-site, and Mo, Ni, and Fe on the B-site. This descriptor-based machine learning approach demonstrates its power for predicting promising perovskite OER candidates.</description>

                Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis.</description>

                Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and robust performance for large-scale seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen holds immense significance. Herein, a highly active bifunctional electrode composed of amorphous cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (CoFeLDH) and crystalline nickel phosphide (Ni2P) (denoted as CoFeLDH@Ni2P), is employed to boost hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis. The strong interface coupling effectively modifies the electronic structure at active sites, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. Impressively, in situ Raman and post-stability analyses demonstrate a unique reconstruction behavior on the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode. Bimetal co-incorporated NiOOH (CoFe-NiOOH) and Ni(OH)2 species are formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while CoFeLDH@Ni2P can transform into Ni(OH)2 species during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Furthermore, the highly negatively charged surface selectively rejects Cl- ions by formed PO43-, endowing CoFeLDH@Ni2P with excellent tolerance and promising durability in saline electrolytes. Consequently, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 and 308 mV for OER to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Additionally, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P(+,-) electrolyzer requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH + Seasalt. This work presents an appealing strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with amorphous-crystalline interfaces, which reveals the source of the activity of transition-metal phosphating compounds in saline water electrolysis.</description>

                Developing dual-function electrocatalysts that improve oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and durability is strongly desirable but still challenging. Herein, ultrasmall Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into hollow hierarchically porous Fe, N-codoped carbon spheres (denoted as Co/Fe-NC) are prepared through one-step pyrolysis of trimetallic ZnCoFe-ZIFs composites. The hierarchically porous structure of Co/Fe-NC demonstrates that the micropores possess strong capability to O2 capture and contribute large specific surface area, the mesopores provide numerous channels for the electrolyte infiltration, and the hollow holes allow more available active sites when used as cathodes of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Consequently, the optimized Co/Fe-NC catalyst demonstrates satisfactory activities with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and onset potential (E0 = 1.04 V), higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (E0 = 0.90 V and E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR. Moreover, a rechargeable ZAB assembled by the Co/Fe-NC electrode displays a large specific capacity of 836.2 mA h g&#8211;1, a power density of 136 mW cm&#8211;2, and excellent durability (maintaining 99% of its initial activity after 1195 cycles). The outstanding catalytic activity of the Co/Fe-NC is attributed to its multicomponent active dopants (Co, Fe, and N), and hollow hierarchical porous nanostructure.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Abstract Despite their great promise as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries, the extensive use of lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O 2 ) batteries is constrained by the slow kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. To increase the overall performance of Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, it is essential to increase the efficiency of oxygen electrode reactions by constructing effective electrocatalysts. As a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, high entropy perovskite oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 )(Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Cr 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 (referred to as LS(MFCCN)O 3 ) is designed and investigated in this article. The introduction of dissimilar metals in LS(MFCCN)O 3 has the potential to cause lattice deformation, thereby enhancing electron transfer between transition metal ions and facilitating the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies. This feature is advantageous for the reversible production and breakdown of discharge product Li 2 O 2 . Consequently, the Li&#8208;O 2 battery utilizing LS(MFCCN)O 3 as a catalyst achieves an impressive discharge capacity of 17,078.2 mAh g &#8722;1 and exhibits an extended cycling life of 435 cycles. This study offers a useful method for adjusting the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides toward oxygen redox reactions in Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Modulation of Dual-Monodispersed Pt&#8211;Ni3S2 as Efficacious Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Concurrent H2 Evolution and Methanol Selective Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01282-4</link>
      <description>Qianqian Zhao, Bin Zhao, Xin Long, Renfei Feng, Mohsen Shakouri, Alisa R. Paterson, Qunfeng Xiao, Yu Zhang, Xian&#8208;Zhu Fu, Jing&#8208;Li Luo, Nano-Micro Letters. 16(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390743659

                Constructing the efficacious and applicable bi-functional electrocatalysts and establishing out the mechanisms of organic electro-oxidation by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical to the development of electrochemically-driven technologies for efficient hydrogen production and avoid CO2 emission. Herein, the hetero-nanocrystals between monodispersed Pt (~ 2 nm) and Ni3S2 (~ 9.6 nm) are constructed as active electrocatalysts through interfacial electronic modulation, which exhibit superior bi-functional activities for methanol selective oxidation and H2 generation. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the asymmetrical charge distribution at Pt-Ni3S2 could be modulated by the electronic interaction at the interface of dual-monodispersed heterojunctions, which thus promote the adsorption/desorption of the chemical intermediates at the interface. As a result, the selective conversion from CH3OH to formate is accomplished at very low potentials (1.45 V) to attain 100 mA cm-2 with high electronic utilization rate (~ 98%) and without CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the Pt-Ni3S2 can simultaneously exhibit a broad potential window with outstanding stability and large current densities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Further, the excellent bi-functional performance is also indicated in the coupled methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)//HER reactor by only requiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with good reusability.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting offers the potential for environmentally friendly hydrogen and oxygen gas generation. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analyses of four organic polymers where metalloporphyrins are the active center nodes. These materials were obtained from the polymerization reaction of poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA) with the respective amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, where M = Fe, 1; Co, 2; Ni, 3; Cu, 4. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images (SEM and TEM) show that these polymers exhibit a layer-type morphology, which is attributed to hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking between the metalloporphyrin nodes. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Among the materials studied, the cobalt-based polymer, 2, demonstrates a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions with overpotentials (&#951;10) of 337 mV and 435 mV, respectively. The Fe, 1, and Ni, 2, polymers are less active for HER with maximum current densities (jmax) of 12.6 and 19.1 mA cm-2 and &#951;10 678 mV, 644 mV. Polymer 2 achieves a jmax of 37.7 mA cm-2 for HER and 133 mA cm-2 for OER. The copper-based material, 4, on the other hand, shows selectivity towards HER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 436 mV and a maximum current density (j) of 45.5 mA cm-2. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance was tested in the overall water-splitting setup, where polymer 2 requires a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a novel approach to heterogenized molecular systems, providing materials with exceptional structural characteristics and enhanced electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Engineering Electrode Polarity for Enhancing In Situ Generation of Hydroxyl Radicals Using Granular Activated Carbon</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14010052</link>
      <description>Stephanie Sarrouf, Amir Taqieddin, Muhammad Fahad Ehsan, Akram N. Alshawabkeh, Catalysts. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390751327

                Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown its effectiveness as a cathode material for in situ ROS generation. Here, we present an electrochemically modified GAC cathode using electrode polarity reversal (PR) approach for enhanced H2O2 decomposition via 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). The successful GAC modification using PR necessitates tuning of the operational parameters such as frequency, current, and time intervals between the PR cycles. This modification enhances the GAC hydrophilicity by increasing the density of surface oxygen functionalities. After optimization of the electrode polarity, using the 20 (No PR)-2 (PR) interval and 140 mA current intensity, the &#8226;OH concentration reaches 38.9 &#956;M compared to the control (No PR) (28.14 &#956;M). Subsequently, we evaluated the enhanced &#8226;OH generation for the removal of glyphosate, a persistent pesticide used as a model contaminant. The modified GAC using PR removed 67.6% of glyphosate compared to 40.6% by the unmodified GAC without PR, respectively. The findings from this study will advance the utilization of GAC for in situ ROS synthesis, which will have direct implications on increasing the effectiveness of electrochemical water treatment systems.</description>

                The controlled cation substitution is an effective strategy for optimizing the density of states and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxide catalysts for water splitting. However, achieving tailored mesoporosity while maintaining elemental homogeneity and phase purity remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming for complex multi-metal oxides. In this study, we utilized a one-step impregnation nanocasting method for synthesizing mesoporous Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-substituted cobalt spinel oxide (Mn0.1Fe0.1Ni0.3Co2.5O4, MFNCO) and demonstrate the benefits of low-temperature calcination within a semi-sealed container at 150&#8211;200 &#176;C. The comprehensive discussion of calcination temperature effects on porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and catalytic performance for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highlights the importance of humidity, which was modulated by a pre-drying step. The catalyst calcined at 170 &#176;C exhibited the lowest overpotential (335 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), highest current density (433 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and further displayed excellent stability over 22 h (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, we successfully adapted this method to utilize cheap, commercially available silica gel as a hard template, yielding comparable OER performance. Our results represent a significant advance in the cost-efficient large-scale preparation of complex multi-metal oxides for catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Redistribution via Anionic Modulator for Superb and Highly Stable Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07364</link>

                Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

                As promising electrode materials, hollow-structured metallic oxides/hydroxides have attracted extensive attention for their significantly enhanced catalyst and electrochemical performances. In practice, however, it is still challenging to construct well-dispersed hollow structures using facile and versatile template-free methods. And, as a result of the weak conductivity of most metallic oxides/hydroxides, it is a particularly effective means to integrate metallic oxides/hydroxides with carbon-based conductive substrates or introduce oxygen vacancies for further promoting reaction kinetics and achieving boosted electrochemical performance. Herein, a novel composite material consisting of oxygen-rich vacancy &#946;-Ni(OH)2 coupled with oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (Ov-N&#946;/Cm) was synthesized using a one-step hydrothermal technique without the need for templates. The hierarchical hollow microsphere structure was achieved by utilizing oxidized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as an alternative to conventional surfactants or templates. The uniform distribution of multistage pores in the newly designed Ov-N&#946;/Cm composite facilitates the transportation of electrolyte ions, thereby endowing it with outstanding electrochemical performance. A straightforward technique for producing high-quality Ni(OH)2-based electrode materials is presented in this investigation, along with fresh perspectives on the formation mechanism of hollow-structured composites. Developing MWCNT-based hollow nanostructured composites with oxygen vacancies-enriched will offer an essential novel avenue to exploit excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and other energy storage systems.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional catalysts are the key to promoting the commercial application of metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy anchoring on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon hollow sphere (Fe x Co 1&#8208;x /N&#8208;C) is intelligently designed by spray pyrolysis (SP). The zinc in the SP&#8208;derived metal oxides and metal&#8208;organic framework volatilize at high temperature to construct a hierarchical porous structure with abundant defects and fully exposes the FeCo nanoparticles which uniformly anchor on the carbon substrate. In this structure, the coexistence of Fe 0.18 Co 0.82 alloy and binary metal active sites (Fe&#8208;N x /Co&#8208;N x ) guarantees the Fe 0.2 Co 0.8 /N&#8208;C catalyst exhibiting an excellent half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 &#9552; 0.84 V) superior to 20% Pt/C for ORR and a suppressed overpotential (280 mV) than RuO 2 for OER. Assembled rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery (RZAB) demonstrates a promising specific capacity of 807.02 mAh g &#8722;1 , peak power density of 159.08 mW cm &#8722;2 and durability without electrolyte circulation (550 h). This work proposes the design concept of utilizing an oxide core to in situ consume the porous carbon shell for anchoring metal active sites and construct defects, which benefits from spray pyrolysis in achieving precise control of the alloy structure and mass preparation.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148598</link>
      <description>Lei Yang, Xiuyun Yao, Changliang Du, Zhanli Han, Mingwei Jin, Shichao Peng, Xiaoqing Ma, Youqi Zhu, Meishuai Zou, Chuanbao Cao, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390651045

                Rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) typically necessitates highly efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts to accelerate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has been demonstrated as a superior energy storage material due to its unique electronic structure for various energy-related applications but is still rarely developed in electrocatalysis field. Herein, the efficient interfacial engineering is reported to motivate and sufficiently boost the ORR performances of ZnSe to an unprecedented level. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the introduction of robust Se-C interactions and N species regulation could efficiently modulate the local electronic structure of ZnSe and improve the interaction with oxygen-containing intermediate, thus producing lower reaction energy barrier of O2 &#8594; OOH* conversion. The optimized ZnSe@PNC catalyst manifests remarkable ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.905 VRHE in alkaline. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries with ZnSe@PNC cathodes show large peak power density (126 mW cm&#8722;2), high specific capacity (818 mAh/g) and long cycling life (200 h). This work provides more possibilities for the electrocatalytic applications of nonprecious metal selenide electrocatalyst for future energy storage.</description>

                The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in overall electrocatalytic water splitting poses a significant challenge in hydrogen production. A series of transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising electrocatalysts, effectively modulating the charge distribution of surrounding atoms for OER. In this study, a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst (CoP-CNR-CNT) was successfully synthesized through the pyrolysis and phosphatization of a Co-doped In-based coordination polymer, specifically InOF-25. This process resulted in evenly dispersed CoP nanoparticles encapsulated in coordination polymer-derived carbon nanoribbons. The synthesized CoP-CNR-CNT demonstrated a competitive OER activity with a smaller overpotential (&#951;10) of 295.7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a satisfactory long-term stability compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2 (&#951;10 = 353.7 mV). The high OER activity and stability can be attributed to the high conductivity of the carbon network, the abundance of CoP particles, and the intricate nanostructure of nanoribbons/nanotubes. This work provides valuable insights into the rational design and facile preparation of efficient non-precious metal-based OER electrocatalysts from inorganic-organic coordination polymers, with potential applications in various energy conversion and storage systems.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Here, we present a ruthenium-anchored aminated multi-walled carbon nanotube-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water splitting (Ru@AM-MWCNTs). The method involves functionalizing MWCNTs before stabilising the ruthenium active sites. The prepared Ru@AM-MWCNTs displayed a low overpotential of 67 mV for HER on a glassy carbon electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Further, to promote the OER activity, Ru@AM-MWCNTs is sintered at 300 &#176;C which reflected the OER at 283 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2. The MEA made up of free-standing polyaniline and Ru@AM-MWCNTs as cathode and T-Ru@AM-MWCNTs as anode on nickel foam, achieved 80 % faradic efficiency for water splitting. In a 1 M KOH, it maintained a current density of 0.51 Acm&#8722;2 for 30 h at an onset potential of 2 V, surpassing the Neosepta membrane's performance under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, the produced oxygen is 98 % pure, demonstrating the MEA's excellent potential for green hydrogen production.</description>

      <description>Hyeyeon Lee, Jayaraman Theerthagiri, M.L. Aruna Kumari, Ahreum Min, Cheol Joo Moon, V. Anbazhagan, Richard L. Brutchey, Myong Yong Choi, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390683852

                By driving the electrooxidation of small molecules instead of relying on sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), low-input voltage is obtained for overall water splitting (OWS) and hydrogen generation, requiring active electrocatalysts. Using single-step pulsed laser irradiation, strong metal-support interaction is achieved on Pd/PdO-decorated Ni3(PO4)2&#183;8H2O (NiPh) microflowers, yielding an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) and hydrazine oxidation (HzOR). When Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 serves as both anode and cathode in the OWS electrolyzer (OER||HER), a cell voltage of 2.098 V achieves 10 mA/cm2 in 1.0 M KOH. When evaluated in the hydrazine-coupled electrolyzer (HzOR||HER), Pd/PdO-NiPh-3 exhibits remarkable stability with a low cell voltage of 0.538 V in 0.5 M-N2H4/1.0 M-KOH, which is approximately 1.56 V lower than that of the traditional water electrolyzers. In Pd/PdO-NiPh, the empty 4s and 5s orbitals of Ni2+ and Pd, respectively, serve as two absorption sites. These sites facilitate chemisorption on the electrocatalyst surface by forming a two-electron dipolar bond between the lone-pair electrons of NH2 groups in N2H4 and Ni2+ as well as Pd. A feasible strategy for utilizing Pd/PdO-NiPh catalysts in developing direct N2H4 fuel cells is investigated in this work, enabling the simultaneous production of robust energy-saving H2 fuel and electricity.</description>

                Developing clean energy sources is vital amid the global energy crisis. Hydrogen, emerging as a sustainable energy vector via water electrolysis, mandates adept catalysts owing to the sluggish electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This work provides a three-step synthesis of Fe-doped NiS2 catalyst from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By encapsulating with nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) armor derived from polypyrrole (PPy) through thermal annealing, a novel Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC catalyst is achieved for improving the OER performance. The Fe&#8211;NiS2@NC demonstrates outstanding prowess, achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with an overpotential as modest as 255 mV, accompanied with a Tafel slope of only 77 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, it maintains operational stability for over 40 h under demanding conditions of 50 mA cm&#8722;2, displaying an impressive durability compared to the pure NiS2 catalyst. This work combines Fe-doping in NiS2 and PPy-derived NC encapsulation, achieving a dual enhancement of activity and stability of the catalyst. And this strategy also offers a feasible pathway to simultaneously boost the activity and stability in OER electrocatalysts, significantly contributing to clean energy solutions and providing ideas for future research.</description>

                MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 spinel oxide was synthesized using the sol&#8211;gel technique, followed by heat treatment at various temperatures (400, 600, 800, and 1000 &#176;C). The prepared materials were examined as anode electrocatalysts for water-splitting systems in alkaline environments. Solid-state characterization methods, such as powder X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), were used to analyze the materials&#8217; crystallographic structure and surface characteristics. The intrinsic activity of the MnCo1.5Fe0.5O4 was fine-tuned by altering the electronic structure by controlling the calcination temperature, and the highest activity was observed for the sample treated at 800 &#176;C. A shift in the valence state of surface cations under oxidative conditions in an alkaline solution during the oxygen evolution reaction was detected through ex situ XAS measurements. Moreover, the influence of the experimental conditions on the electrocatalytic performance of the material, including the pH of the electrolyte and the temperature, was demonstrated.</description>

                This study focuses on exploring alternative catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in renewable fuel production, emphasizing the potential of multi-metal oxides derived from Earth-abundant metals and perovskites. The research integrates traditional experiments with machine learning and theoretical investigations, utilizing descriptors like oxygen p-band center (Op) and metal d-band center (Md). Through high-throughput calculations and crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNN), the study screens a large compositional space of perovskites and predicts Op/Md for 149,952 perovskites, highlighting elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 as promising for OER active materials. Notably, an analysis of the elemental ratios around Op/Md=0.48 revealed higher proportions of Ca, Sr, and Ba on the A-site, and Mo, Ni, and Fe on the B-site. This descriptor-based machine learning approach demonstrates its power for predicting promising perovskite OER candidates.</description>

                Green hydrogen produced by water splitting using renewable electricity is essential to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Present water electrolysis technologies are uncompetitive with low-cost grey hydrogen produced from fossil fuels, limiting their scale-up potential. Disruptive processes that decouple the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and produce them in separate cells or different stages emerge as a prospective route to reduce system cost by enabling operation without expensive membranes and sealing components. Some of these processes divide the hydrogen or oxygen evolution reactions into electrochemical and chemical sub-reactions, enabling them to achieve high efficiency. However, high efficiency has been demonstrated only in a batch process with thermal swings that present operational challenges. This work introduces a breakthrough process that produces hydrogen and oxygen in separate cells and supports continuous operation in a membraneless system. We demonstrate high faradaic and electrolytic efficiency and high rate operation in a near-neutral electrolyte of NaBr in water, whereby bromide is electro-oxidized to bromate concurrent with hydrogen evolution in one cell, and bromate is chemically reduced to bromide in a catalytic reaction that evolves oxygen in another cell. This process may lead the way to high-efficiency membraneless water electrolysis that overcomes the limitations of century-old membrane electrolysis.</description>

                Developing electrocatalysts with high activity and robust performance for large-scale seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen holds immense significance. Herein, a highly active bifunctional electrode composed of amorphous cobalt-iron layered double hydroxides (CoFeLDH) and crystalline nickel phosphide (Ni2P) (denoted as CoFeLDH@Ni2P), is employed to boost hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis. The strong interface coupling effectively modifies the electronic structure at active sites, thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction kinetics. Impressively, in situ Raman and post-stability analyses demonstrate a unique reconstruction behavior on the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode. Bimetal co-incorporated NiOOH (CoFe-NiOOH) and Ni(OH)2 species are formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while CoFeLDH@Ni2P can transform into Ni(OH)2 species during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. Furthermore, the highly negatively charged surface selectively rejects Cl- ions by formed PO43-, endowing CoFeLDH@Ni2P with excellent tolerance and promising durability in saline electrolytes. Consequently, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P electrode exhibits an overpotential of 106 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2 and 308 mV for OER to achieve 100 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Additionally, the CoFeLDH@Ni2P(+,-) electrolyzer requires a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH + Seasalt. This work presents an appealing strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with amorphous-crystalline interfaces, which reveals the source of the activity of transition-metal phosphating compounds in saline water electrolysis.</description>

                Developing dual-function electrocatalysts that improve oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and durability is strongly desirable but still challenging. Herein, ultrasmall Co nanoparticles (NPs) embedded into hollow hierarchically porous Fe, N-codoped carbon spheres (denoted as Co/Fe-NC) are prepared through one-step pyrolysis of trimetallic ZnCoFe-ZIFs composites. The hierarchically porous structure of Co/Fe-NC demonstrates that the micropores possess strong capability to O2 capture and contribute large specific surface area, the mesopores provide numerous channels for the electrolyte infiltration, and the hollow holes allow more available active sites when used as cathodes of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Consequently, the optimized Co/Fe-NC catalyst demonstrates satisfactory activities with a half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.91 V) and onset potential (E0 = 1.04 V), higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (E0 = 0.90 V and E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR. Moreover, a rechargeable ZAB assembled by the Co/Fe-NC electrode displays a large specific capacity of 836.2 mA h g&#8211;1, a power density of 136 mW cm&#8211;2, and excellent durability (maintaining 99% of its initial activity after 1195 cycles). The outstanding catalytic activity of the Co/Fe-NC is attributed to its multicomponent active dopants (Co, Fe, and N), and hollow hierarchical porous nanostructure.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Abstract Despite their great promise as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries, the extensive use of lithium&#8208;oxygen (Li&#8208;O 2 ) batteries is constrained by the slow kinetics of both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. To increase the overall performance of Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, it is essential to increase the efficiency of oxygen electrode reactions by constructing effective electrocatalysts. As a high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for Li&#8208;O 2 batteries, high entropy perovskite oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 )(Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Cr 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 )O 3 (referred to as LS(MFCCN)O 3 ) is designed and investigated in this article. The introduction of dissimilar metals in LS(MFCCN)O 3 has the potential to cause lattice deformation, thereby enhancing electron transfer between transition metal ions and facilitating the formation of numerous oxygen vacancies. This feature is advantageous for the reversible production and breakdown of discharge product Li 2 O 2 . Consequently, the Li&#8208;O 2 battery utilizing LS(MFCCN)O 3 as a catalyst achieves an impressive discharge capacity of 17,078.2 mAh g &#8722;1 and exhibits an extended cycling life of 435 cycles. This study offers a useful method for adjusting the catalytic performance of perovskite oxides toward oxygen redox reactions in Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Modulation of Dual-Monodispersed Pt&#8211;Ni3S2 as Efficacious Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Concurrent H2 Evolution and Methanol Selective Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-023-01282-4</link>
      <description>Qianqian Zhao, Bin Zhao, Xin Long, Renfei Feng, Mohsen Shakouri, Alisa R. Paterson, Qunfeng Xiao, Yu Zhang, Xian&#8208;Zhu Fu, Jing&#8208;Li Luo, Nano-Micro Letters. 16(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390743659

                Constructing the efficacious and applicable bi-functional electrocatalysts and establishing out the mechanisms of organic electro-oxidation by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critical to the development of electrochemically-driven technologies for efficient hydrogen production and avoid CO2 emission. Herein, the hetero-nanocrystals between monodispersed Pt (~ 2 nm) and Ni3S2 (~ 9.6 nm) are constructed as active electrocatalysts through interfacial electronic modulation, which exhibit superior bi-functional activities for methanol selective oxidation and H2 generation. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the asymmetrical charge distribution at Pt-Ni3S2 could be modulated by the electronic interaction at the interface of dual-monodispersed heterojunctions, which thus promote the adsorption/desorption of the chemical intermediates at the interface. As a result, the selective conversion from CH3OH to formate is accomplished at very low potentials (1.45 V) to attain 100 mA cm-2 with high electronic utilization rate (~ 98%) and without CO2 emission. Meanwhile, the Pt-Ni3S2 can simultaneously exhibit a broad potential window with outstanding stability and large current densities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Further, the excellent bi-functional performance is also indicated in the coupled methanol oxidation reaction (MOR)//HER reactor by only requiring a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm-2 with good reusability.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting offers the potential for environmentally friendly hydrogen and oxygen gas generation. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical analyses of four organic polymers where metalloporphyrins are the active center nodes. These materials were obtained from the polymerization reaction of poly(p-phenylene terephtalamide) (PPTA) with the respective amino-functionalized metalloporphyrins, where M = Fe, 1; Co, 2; Ni, 3; Cu, 4. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images (SEM and TEM) show that these polymers exhibit a layer-type morphology, which is attributed to hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking between the metalloporphyrin nodes. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Among the materials studied, the cobalt-based polymer, 2, demonstrates a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions with overpotentials (&#951;10) of 337 mV and 435 mV, respectively. The Fe, 1, and Ni, 2, polymers are less active for HER with maximum current densities (jmax) of 12.6 and 19.1 mA cm-2 and &#951;10 678 mV, 644 mV. Polymer 2 achieves a jmax of 37.7 mA cm-2 for HER and 133 mA cm-2 for OER. The copper-based material, 4, on the other hand, shows selectivity towards HER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 436 mV and a maximum current density (j) of 45.5 mA cm-2. The bifunctional electrocatalytic performance was tested in the overall water-splitting setup, where polymer 2 requires a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm-2. This work presents a novel approach to heterogenized molecular systems, providing materials with exceptional structural characteristics and enhanced electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

                Recently, granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown its effectiveness as a cathode material for in situ ROS generation. Here, we present an electrochemically modified GAC cathode using electrode polarity reversal (PR) approach for enhanced H2O2 decomposition via 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR). The successful GAC modification using PR necessitates tuning of the operational parameters such as frequency, current, and time intervals between the PR cycles. This modification enhances the GAC hydrophilicity by increasing the density of surface oxygen functionalities. After optimization of the electrode polarity, using the 20 (No PR)-2 (PR) interval and 140 mA current intensity, the &#8226;OH concentration reaches 38.9 &#956;M compared to the control (No PR) (28.14 &#956;M). Subsequently, we evaluated the enhanced &#8226;OH generation for the removal of glyphosate, a persistent pesticide used as a model contaminant. The modified GAC using PR removed 67.6% of glyphosate compared to 40.6% by the unmodified GAC without PR, respectively. The findings from this study will advance the utilization of GAC for in situ ROS synthesis, which will have direct implications on increasing the effectiveness of electrochemical water treatment systems.</description>

                The controlled cation substitution is an effective strategy for optimizing the density of states and enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal oxide catalysts for water splitting. However, achieving tailored mesoporosity while maintaining elemental homogeneity and phase purity remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming for complex multi-metal oxides. In this study, we utilized a one-step impregnation nanocasting method for synthesizing mesoporous Mn-, Fe-, and Ni-substituted cobalt spinel oxide (Mn0.1Fe0.1Ni0.3Co2.5O4, MFNCO) and demonstrate the benefits of low-temperature calcination within a semi-sealed container at 150&#8211;200 &#176;C. The comprehensive discussion of calcination temperature effects on porosity, particle size, surface chemistry and catalytic performance for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) highlights the importance of humidity, which was modulated by a pre-drying step. The catalyst calcined at 170 &#176;C exhibited the lowest overpotential (335 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2), highest current density (433 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.7 V vs. RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and further displayed excellent stability over 22 h (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, we successfully adapted this method to utilize cheap, commercially available silica gel as a hard template, yielding comparable OER performance. Our results represent a significant advance in the cost-efficient large-scale preparation of complex multi-metal oxides for catalytic applications.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Facile and scalable synthesis of Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>
      <description>Jianxin Zeng, Zhengxin Qian, Qing-Na Zheng, Jing&#8208;Hua Tian, Hua Zhang, Jianfeng Li, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390615127

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Anodic leaching plus chronopotentiometric aging of Ni2Fe ingot for sustainable oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions</title>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390563400

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05313</link>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <description>Jing Mei, Yu Deng, Xiaohong Cheng, Qi Wu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390858579

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

      <title>Low onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction on hematite electrodes processed with He plasma irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.110</link>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390563400

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Facile and scalable synthesis of Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

      <description>Jing Mei, Yu Deng, Xiaohong Cheng, Qi Wu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390858579

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Anodic leaching plus chronopotentiometric aging of Ni2Fe ingot for sustainable oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions</title>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390563400

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05313</link>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Facile and scalable synthesis of Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Anodic leaching plus chronopotentiometric aging of Ni2Fe ingot for sustainable oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions</title>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

      <title>Low onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction on hematite electrodes processed with He plasma irradiation</title>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05313</link>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Facile and scalable synthesis of Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

      <description>Jing Mei, Yu Deng, Xiaohong Cheng, Qi Wu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390858579

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

      <title>Low onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction on hematite electrodes processed with He plasma irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.110</link>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

      <description>Xiongming Du, Yan Wang, Zicong Ye, Wei Wang, Yuqiao Wang, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390581925

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2023.123682</link>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390563400

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Recent advances on cationic vacancy engineering application of oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst in seawater</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.111946</link>
      <description>Hong Liang, Bo Li, Chenchen Jing, Zihan Zhuang, Yuji Zhang, Huajie Huang, Qianqian Jiang, Jianguo Tang, Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390858649

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Facile and scalable synthesis of Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>
      <description>Jianxin Zeng, Zhengxin Qian, Qing-Na Zheng, Jing&#8208;Hua Tian, Hua Zhang, Jianfeng Li, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390615127

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

      <title>Anodic leaching plus chronopotentiometric aging of Ni2Fe ingot for sustainable oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions</title>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>
      <description>Hizkia Manuel Vieri, M. W. Kim, Arash Badakhsh, Sun Hee Choi, Energies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390910364

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>

                0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

                Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two half reactions that make up the over water splitting reaction. Increasing oxygen evolution reaction rate wound immensely raise the efficiency of over water splitting reaction because it is the rate limiting reaction in water splitting reaction. The key to improve OER performance is the development and utilization of advanced catalysts. As one of the most potential catalysts for HER, it has gradually attracted the attention of researchers in the aspect of catalytic OER. It is very necessary to review the research progress of Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in catalytic OER to promote the research process in the field. In this review, we comprehensively and systematically summarized the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER. First of all, structural regulation of TMDs-based electrocatalyst was summarized in detail, mainly including size engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, phase engineering and heterojunction engineering. Once more, magnetic field regulation as a representative of external field regulation to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER performance was discussed in depth. Last but not least, the strategies to improve TMDs electrocatalytic OER is prospected and some views on the development of this field are also put forward, which are expected to enhance the catalytic efficiency of TMDs for OER.</description>

      <title>Material Dynamics of Manganese-Based Oxychlorides for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390563400

                In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Nanostructured Copper-Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05313</link>

                In water splitting processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main kinetic control steps that should be triggered by high-efficiency catalysts. A series of Cu-based catalysts are considered potential candidates. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for fabricating large-scale copper-based catalysts by anodization on a copper foil at room temperature in a KOH solution. The representative petal-shaped CuO and Cu(OH)2 nanorods are obtained. The corresponding surface areas are 0.0197 and 1.966 m2/g, respectively. The surface wettability of Cu(OH)2 is lower than that of CuO. The catalytic performance is studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results show that the potential of the OER for CuO at 10 mA/cm2 is 1.67 V, which reduces by 130 mV compared to Cu(OH)2. The CuO could keep 10 mA/cm2 after a 1 h chronoamperometry test, which is about 3 times higher than that of Cu(OH)2. To verify the distinguishing catalytic difference between CuO and Cu(OH)2, in situ Raman spectra have been recorded. Inspiringly, the CuIII active specie at 603 cm&#8211;1 is captured during the OER process on CuO instead of Cu(OH)2. The related mechanism has been discussed in detail.</description>

                It is of great significance to develop electrocatalysts that are abundant in Earth's crust, highly efficient, and exceptionally durable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), particularly in neutral media. Herein, the hierarchical CoFe2O4 nanosheets supported on iron foam (CoFe2O4/IF) are prepared by the ambient spontaneous redox reaction between iron foam and Co2+ at room temperature. The as-obtained CoFe2O4/IF electrode presents excellent electrocatalytic OER activity with an overpotential of 429 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stability of 50 h in 1 M PBS. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity of CoFe2O4/IF can be credited to the decreased transfer resistance and unique structural features. In addition, the CoFe2O4/IF presented here holds promise for noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), occurring at the anode of electrochemical water splitting requires a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis mechanism to optimize its efficiency. Atomically dispersed transition metal supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is featured with excellent catalytic performance. Herein, we report a Mg/Co bimetal site which utilizes Mg 3p electrons with strong binding of *OH (the first key reaction intermediates in the free energy diagram) to trigger the OER reaction and Co 3d itinerant character to regulate the binding strength of *O. Benefiting from the fine-tuned adsorption/desorption possesses, the optimized catalyst delivers superior OER activity with low overpotential, i.e., 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 455 mV at 100 mA/cm2. Moreover, the current density is able to be maintained at 10 mA/cm2 for 10 h, consistent with the theoretical simulations for oxidization process, which demonstrates stable configurations after multiple *OH modification, revealing robust applicability in alkaline medium.</description>

                Hierarchical carbon skeletons derived from natural wood can be employed as the substrates to fabricate self-supported catalysts. The typically three sections (cross section, radial section, and tangential section) of wood would significantly affect the electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, the correlations between anisotropy structure of wood derived hierarchical carbon skeletons and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances was systematically investigated. The cross-sectional wood-derived carbon decorated with Co nanoparticles requires an overpotential of 370 mV to deliver 50 mA cm-2 superior to those of radial-sectional and tangential-sectional counterparts. The cross-section of wood derived carbon skeleton possesses higher content of Co nanoparticles, which is accounted for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. This work highlights the critical contribution of anisotropy of carbon skeletons in promoting the OER properties and provides a new paradigm for designing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

                Seawater oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kind of feasible method to solve energy problems. Through studying seawater OER, it can not only reduce the dependence on traditional energy sources, but also protect the environment and reducing pollution. Cationic defect engineering can effectively enhance the properties of seawater OER. This way can make more catalysts active sites exposed and simultaneously change the electronic properties of materials to improve the conductivity of materials. Meanwhile, defects lead to electron delocalization, promote carrier migration and increase the charge transfer rate of materials. Cationic vacancy defects can effectively improve the OER properties of materials. Therefore, studying relationship between structure and function of vacancy defect electrocatalysts is beneficial to improve the seawater OER performance better. The transition metal-based vacancy catalyst has good seawater OER performance, for example, Fe, Co and Ni based vacancy catalysts. The influence of cationic vacancy on the improvement of OER performance in seawater was further expounded by the DFT of analysis of cationic vacancy catalyst. With the continuous progress of technology, the cost of seawater electrolysis technology will be gradually reduced, which can greatly promote the development of sustainable and renewable clean energy.</description>

                Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

                This study employed a one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize Ni3S2/Fe3O4 nanoblocks in situ on nickel foam (NF). The resulting Ni3S2/Fe3O4/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and robust long-term stability. It achieves a low overpotential of only 220 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 54.1 mV dec&#8722;1 and remains stable in 1.0 M KOH for 66 h. The binder-free self-supported three-dimensional nanoblocks enhance the reaction region and long-term stability. Electronic interactions between Fe3O4 and Ni3S2, coupled with heterogeneous interfaces, optimize the electronic structure, fostering the formation of highly reactive species. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Ni3S2/Fe3O4, with a heterogeneous interfacial structure, modulates the chemisorption of reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface, optimizing the Gibbs free energies (&#916;G) of oxygen-containing intermediates. The synergistic effect between the two active materials within the heterogeneous structure enhances OER catalytic performance. This finding offers a valuable approach to designing efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301222</link>

                Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Commercial stainless steel has attracted increasing interest due to their rich content in transition metal elements and corrosion resistance properties. In this work, we design a facile and rapid route to in-situ fabricate the Cr doped FeNi layered double hydroxides nanosheets (LDHs) on modified stainless steel (Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ ESS) under ambient condition.The ultra small scaled 2D structure only around 20 nm diameter and metal ions with multivalent oxidation state were observed on the in situ fabricated LDHs, which provides high active area and active sites and thus promote excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Cr&#8211;FeNi LDH @ESS electrocatalysts exhibit an over potential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and achieves a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may promote the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.</description>

                A Ni&#8211;Fe binary alloy ingot, prepared by conventional vacuum smelting, was adopted as substrate in this work to fabricate the anode for water splitting. To improve the surface roughness of anode surface, the electrode was firstly subjected to anodic leaching in a simple KSCN solution. The as-leached electrode was subsequently activated through linear sweep voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution with or without 0.33 M urea addition to finish the final step for electrode preparation. The as-prepared anode delivers the 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density at an overpotential of 284 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and at 1.361 V (RHE) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), respectively. No apparent change of OER and UOR performance was observed after chronopotentiometric aging. The more complex UOR behavior was analyzed to elucidate the synergy among all constituents functioning through direct or indirect mechanisms for the half-reaction on this binder-free, self-supporting and substrate-rejuvenating anode.</description>

                In this study, we developed a statistical framework, named multistage data quantification (MSDQ), to evaluate representative surface characteristics such as surface roughness, surface area, and homogeneity score of cobalt oxide&#8208;based anodes, and contributing to a deeper insight into quality of anode surface. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to capture the surface morphology of two anodes that have a comparable loading of cobalt oxide but exhibit distinct morphological features. Application of MSDQ exposed notable disparities in surface characteristics across these anodes, underlining the critical importance of MSDQ in precise surface characterization. Specifically, surface roughness, surface area and homogeneity score effectively elucidated the disparities in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as quantified through scanning droplet cell (SDC) measurements. By conducting a systematic comparative analysis, the respective contributions of the extrinsic surface characteristics of the anodes to the intrinsic electrocatalytic material property could be differentiated and quantified. Applications of our findings range from benchmarking of anodes to optimization of anode manufacturing processes.</description>

                Membrane&#8211;Electrode Assemblies This cover design depicts a highly active and stable Ir oxide electrodeposited on Ti felt as an oxygen electrode in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). This work, in article 2300276 by Yong-Tae Kim, Sehkyu Park, and co-workers, emphasizes that the interaction between the catalyst layer and substrate through thermal annealing induces Ir bulk phase transition, detrimentally affecting oxygen evolution reaction in PEMWEs.</description>

                Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

                Hydrogen is considered as one of the clean secondary energy sources required in industry and daily life. Electrocatalytic hydrogen production is believed to be the most reliable method for converting renewable energy into chemical energy. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal disulfides (TMDs), as an emerging electrocatalysts, have been widely investigated for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Herein, this review summarizes the recent progress and the strategies of ultrathin TMDs for improving the OER electrocatalytic activities. The basic catalytic mechanism of OER is first introduced, and then the catalytic characteristics of 2D TMDs are presented. Importantly, this review specifically concentrates on strategies to improve catalytic activity such as phase engineering, defect/vacancy engineering, heterostructure, doping effect, and catalyst support material. It can be concluded that these regulatory strategies can largely enhance the electrocatalytic performance by increasing the active site exposure and improving the electrocatalytic kinetics. In addition, the challenges and perspectives of 2D TMDs catalysts are presented, which offers valuable guidance in designing efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalysts for future energy applications. We hope that this review will inspire future studies and bridge the gap between strategy design and practical application.</description>

      <title>Low onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction on hematite electrodes processed with He plasma irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.110</link>
      <description>Shin Kajita, Anja Bieberle&#8208;H&#252;tter, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390892019

                In this study, we investigated the effects of helium (He) plasma irradiation and thermal treatment on the morphology, the surface characteristics, and the photoelectrochemical performance of bulk iron (Fe) sheets. After processing, all samples consisted mainly of an &#945;-Fe2O3 surface. Helium plasma irradiation resulted in a cathodic shift in the onset potential of the photocurrent from 1.16 VRHE (no pretreatment) to 0.57 VRHE (plasma exposure at 660 &#176;C), where VRHE represents the potential versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). An increase in the surface roughness and a smaller amount of hydroxyl or oxygen vacancies at the surface after photoelectrochemical measurement are related to the decrease of the onset potential. The results show that He plasma irradiation does not only modify the surface morphology, but also affects the functional properties of the materials.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia via Nitrogen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions&#8212;A Comprehensive Review on Electrolyte-Supported Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17020441</link>

                The application of protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis has been evaluated over the past 14 years. While nitrogen (N2) is the conventional fuel on the cathode side, various fuels such as methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and steam (H2O) have been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode side. Because H2 is predominantly produced through CO2-emitting methane reforming, H2O has been the conventional carbon-free option thus far. Although the potential of utilizing H2O and N2 as fuels is considerable, studies exploring this specific combination remain limited. PCEC fabrication technologies are being developed extensively, thus necessitating a comprehensive review. Several strategies for electrode fabrication, deposition, and electrolyte design are discussed herein. The progress in electrode development for PCECs has also been delineated. Finally, the existing challenges and prospective outlook of PCEC for NH3 synthesis are analyzed and discussed. The most significant finding is the lack of past research involving PCEC with H2O and N2 as fuel configurations and the diversity of nitrogen reduction reaction catalysts. This review indicates that the maximum NH3 synthesis rate is 14 &#215; 10&#8722;9 mol cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and the maximum current density for the OER catalyst is 1.241 A cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the pellet electrolyte thickness must be maintained at approximately 0.8&#8211;1.5 mm, and the stability of thin-film electrolytes must be improved.</description>
