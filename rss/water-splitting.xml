                Designing and synthesizing hollow frame structures with unique three-dimensional open structures in electrocatalysis remain a challenge. Etching is an effective method to synthesize metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a hollow structure and rich function. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of Hf-doped CoP hollow nanocubes by selective etching and ion exchange. Different from the traditional etching method, we used acid xylenol orange solution to etch typically the (211) crystal face of ZIF-67, obtaining the unique bell-like structure, named XO-ZIF-67. Subsequently, Hf-doped CoP hollow nanocubes were formed by Hf</description>

      <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution Reaction Enabled by Ni Cavity-Arrayed Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-cb2sk</link>
      <description>Daiki Ashizawa, Masaki Itatani, Tomohiro Fukushima, Kei Murakoshi, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400245875

                The water electrolysis is mostly limited by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) including the interfacial electron and mass transfer and autoionization reactions. Especially in the neutral pH condition, slow rate of the autoionization reaction of water molecules also limits the electrolysis. The vibrational strong coupling, where the matter excitation is coupled to the cavity vacuum field mediated by a virtual photon, can be expected to modulate the physicochemical properties of water. Here, we utilized the cavity-arrayed electrode for the promotion of the OER. The OER activities of Ni cavity-array electrodes were evaluated from the oxygen bubble growth behavior. The Tafel slopes from the bubble analyses were modulated from 120 mV per decade to 30 mV per decade and the OER activity was enhanced by the cavity-arrayed electrode. This enhancement was explained with regards to the acceleration of autoionization of water molecules under the vibrational strong coupling. This study demonstrates that the cavity systems modulate the thermodynamic equilibrium of water autoionization under the vibrational strong coupling of liquid water at room temperature, leading to enhanced OER.</description>

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Flexible and Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402761</link>
      <description>Chengyu Song, Chen&#8208;Jin Huang, Huimin Xu, Zhijie Zhang, Ting&#8208;Yu Shuai, Qimin Zhan, Gao&#8208;Ren Li, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400247901

                Abstract Flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) exhibit high energy density, ultra&#8208;thin, lightweight, green, and safe features, and are considered as one of the ideal power sources for flexible wearable electronics. However, the slow and high overpotential oxygen reaction at the air cathode has become one of the key factors restricting the development of FZABs. The improvement of activity and stability of bifunctional catalysts has become a top priority. At the same time, FZABs should maintain the battery performance under different bending and twisting conditions, and the design of the overall structure of FZABs is also important. Based on the understanding of the three typical configurations and working principles of FZABs, this work highlights two common strategies for applying bifunctional catalysts to FZABs: 1) powder&#8208;based flexible air cathode and 2) flexible self&#8208;supported air cathode. It summarizes the recent advances in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and explores the various types of catalyst structures as well as the related mechanistic understanding. Based on the latest catalyst research advances, this paper introduces and discusses various structure modulation strategies and expects to guide the synthesis and preparation of efficient bifunctional catalysts. Finally, the current status and challenges of bifunctional catalyst research in FZABs are summarized.</description>

                The fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in aqueous environment has far-reaching significance. Especially, reasonable interface process regulation toward heterogeneous composites can make full use of the active sites and improve the electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we designed and synthesized NiS2-MoS2-based heterogeneous composites as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The heterostructure was obtained by one-step hydrothermal ulfurization operation towards polymolybdate-based metal-organic complex. The composition and nanostructures can be tailored by modulating experiment parameter, realizing the phase-controlled synthesis and interface regulation: (1) High-percentage of 1T-MoS2 can be achieved via selecting appropriate vulcanization time and thiourea concentration, benifiting for the higher electroconductivity and more active sites; (2) Regular and orderly vulcanization time promotes the gradual growth and aggregation of nanosheets; (3) The existence of nickel hydroxide improves the electrocatalytic stability for oxygen production performance. The optimized heterogeneous interfaces provide sufficient active sites and accelerate electron transfer. Consequently, the optimal heterogeneous nanosheets present low overpotentials of 33 and 122 mV at the catalytic current densities of 10 mA/cm2 for HER and OER, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance in Co&#8211;Fe Hydroxides through Boron Doping</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/pssa.202400481</link>

                Among hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis stands out, but its efficiency is hampered by the substantial energy barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this, incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) into Co&#8211;Fe hydroxide (CoFeO x H y ) promotes higher oxidation states of involved metals, greatly enhancing OER activity and charge transfer capabilities. Herein, the synthesis of a range of amorphous CoFeB nanoparticles with varying Fe to (Co+Fe) atomic ratios achieved through a simple chemical reduction method using CoFe&#8208;Prussian blue analogs as precursors and employing M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to observe structural characteristics before and after transformation is reported. Among these nanoparticles, the CoFe 0.25 B variant, exhibiting favorable electrochemical properties, is chosen and subsequently subjected to hydrolysis to yield CoFe 0.25 BOH nanoparticles, serving as an active catalyst for OER. At a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , the overpotentials for CoFe 0.25 O x H y and CoFe 0.25 BOH are 362 and 310 mV, respectively, with Tafel slopes decreasing from 393 to 93 mV dec &#8722;1 . Furthermore, the i &#8211; t test reveals no significant loss of electrochemical performance within 24 h, substantiating the efficacy of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of CoFeO x H y through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient elements. This research offers novel insights into the development of efficient and stable water electrolysis catalysts.</description>

      <title>Advances, mechanisms and applications in oxygen evolution electrocatalysis of gold-driven</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153719</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Among different metal elements, gold (Au) stands out due to its high electronegativity and remarkable catalytic properties, especially when it is in nanoscale size. In this review, we aim to comprehensively analyze the oxygen electrocatalytic performance of nanosized Au, including the influence of the crystal surface, morphology, substrate materials of Au nanoparticles, size and ligands of Au nanoclusters, and Au single atoms on oxygen electrocatalysis. By exploring the catalytic performance of noble metals, non-noble metals, oxides, hydroxides/oxyhydroxides/layered double hydroxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, and selenides through the integration of nanosized Au, which offers valuable insights for enhancing the OER efficiency. These effects can be attributed to two mechanisms: i) adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and ii) lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM), where the nanosized Au changed the electronic structure of the catalysts and improved the adsorption of reaction intermediates to accelerate electron transfer process or exerts the synergistic effect between metallic Au and oxygen vacancies. For instance, Gold-driven OER catalysts can be widely used in zinc-air batteries and water splitting in the future.</description>

      <title>Trivalent Cation Defect Optimization Spin State of Nickel(II) in NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Oxygen Evolution</title>

                The defects have been confirmed to activate catalytic sites and significantly enhance electrocatalytic activity. However, the influence of defects on the electronic spin state of catalytic active sites and their impact on catalytic behavior are still in the early stages of research. Spin behavior is a fundamental property of the electrons. Herein, using NiFe-LDH nanosheets as the model structure, we constructed trivalent cation vacancy models to gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic relationship among defects, spin, and catalytic activity from the perspective of the electronic spin state. The presence of defects leads to an increased proportion of the dz2 orbital perpendicular to the plane and the dxy orbital parallel to the LDH layer, which enhancement effectively improves the capture of out-of-plane oxygen intermediates and facilitates electron transfer within the plane. As a result, the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is greatly improved. In addition, magnetic field experiments may also be used to better understand the role of spin in the catalytic process. With the increase of defect concentration, the spin-magnetic response intensity of the OER can be effectively enhanced, which is related to the defect-induced spin single electron. This work explains how defects can effectively modulate the electron spin properties of active centers, thereby achieving enhanced catalytic reaction kinetics. By shedding light on the principles governing catalytic sites at the electron spin level, we would aid in the understanding and design of catalysts at the spintronic level.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Heterostructure Engineering and Theorical Aspects of a Hierarchical Nanostructure NiFe-NS/NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Array Enabling Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c00299</link>
      <description>Qirun Wang, Wenjue Li, Zhenyu Zhang, Xiaowei Xu, Jichao Shi, Lin Lin, Dandan Wu, Sheng Han, Ruoyi Jia, Shufang Chang, ACS applied energy materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400274451

                The design of multiphase heterostructures presents a promising strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and serves as an effective approach to constructing efficient alkaline OER catalysts. In this paper, the OER catalyst with a NiFe-NS/NiMoO4 layered heterostructure was synthesized by reflux condensation and hydrothermal methods. The unique rock-like nanospheres can increase the specific surface area and provide more active sites. The formation of heterojunctions through the modification of NiFe nanospheres on NiMoO4 nanorods can induce changes in their electronic structure. Due to its inherent properties, NiFe-NS/NiMoO4 demonstrates higher performance than commercial RuO2 (which has an overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2), with overpotentials of 196 and 294 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. The stability of the sample was proved to be excellent during a 50 h stability test. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also indicate that the improved efficiency of the OER can be attributed to controlling and adjusting of the electron structure through heterojunction formation as well as the collaborative impact resulting from NiFe and NiMoO4. The structure enables optimized adsorption of intermediates and facilitates the kinetics of OER, and provides an idea for the design of heterogeneous catalysts.</description>

                Electrochemical production of green hydrogen via water-splitting is an emerging technology to generate a substitute source of energy. However, due to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), high cost, lesser availability and easy oxidation of noble metal-based electrocatalysts led the explorers to find an efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. In the current communication, we have developed a synthesis strategy for the preparation of hybrid electrocatalyst composed of bimetallic (iron, nickel) based metal organic framework (FeNiBTC MOF) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) via solvothermal reaction. Thanks to the ultrathin heterostructure with high electrical conductivity of MXene, with abundant active sites of FeNiBTC MOF, the as-prepared hybrid electrocatalyst FeNiBTC@MXene, leads the high efficiency OER in an alkaline environment. FeNiBTC MOF was impeccably decorated on the surfaces of MXene nanosheets with different FeNiBTC to MXene ratios and was characterized via pXRD, FESEM/EDS, XPS and BET. The optimized hybrid structured catalyst (FeNiBTC@Mx-3) revealed the best performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel plot value of 38.4 mV/dec and stable up to 1000th CV cycles.</description>

                The strategic design of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in tackling the substantial energy demands associated with hydrogen production in electrolytic water splitting. Despite extensive research on birnessite (&#948;-MnO2) manganese oxides to enhance catalytic activity by modulating Mn3+ species, the ongoing challenge is to simultaneously stabilize Mn3+ while improving overall activity. Herein, oxygen (O) vacancies and nitrogen (N) doping have been simultaneously introduced into the MnO2 through a simple nitrogen plasma approach, resulting in efficient OER performance. The optimized N-MnO2v electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER activity in alkaline electrolyte, reducing the overpotential by nearly 160 mV compared to pure pristine MnO2 (from 476 to 312 mV) at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a small Tafel slope of 89 mV dec&#8211;1. Moreover, it demonstrates excellent durability over a 122 h stability test. The introduction of O vacancies and incorporation of N not only fine-tune the electronic structure of MnO2, increasing the Mn3+ content to enhance overall activity, but also play a crucial role in stabilizing Mn3+, thereby leading to exceptional stability over time. Subsequently, density functional theory calculations validate the optimized electronic structure of MnO2 achieved through the two engineering methods, effectively lowering the intermediate adsorption free energy barrier. Our synergistic approach, utilizing nitrogen plasma treatment, opens a pathway to concurrently enhance the activity and stability of OER electrocatalysts, applicable not only to Mn-based but also to other transition metal oxides.</description>

                Multimetal phosphides derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest owing to their distinct electronic configurations and abundant active sites. However, developing robust and efficient catalysts based on metal phosphides for overall water splitting (OWS) remains challenging. Herein, we present an approach for synthesizing a self-supporting hollow porous cubic FeNiP-CoP@NC catalyst on a nickel foam (NF) substrate. Through ion exchange, the reconstruction chemistry transforms the FeNi-MOF nanospheres into intricate hollow porous FeNi-MOF-Co nanocubes. After phosphorization, numerous N, P co-doped carbon-coated FeNiP-CoP nanoparticles were tightly embedded within a two-dimensional (2D) carbon matrix. The NF/FeNiP-CoP@NC heterostructure retained a porous configuration, numerous heterogeneous interfaces, distinct defects, and a rich composition of active sites. Moreover, incorporating Co and the resulting structural evolution facilitated the electron transfer in FeNiP-CoP@NC, enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) processes. Consequently, the NF/FeNiP-CoP@NC catalyst demonstrated very low overpotentials of 78 mV for OER and 254 mV for HER in an alkaline medium. It also exhibited excellent long-term stability at various potentials (@10 mA cm&#8722;2, @20 mA cm&#8722;2, and @50 mA cm&#8722;2). As an overall water splitting cell, it required only 1.478 V to drive a current density of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a synergistic effect between multimetal phosphides, enhancing the intrinsic OER and HER activities of FeNiP-CoP@NC. This work not only elucidates the role of heteroatom induction in structural reconstruction but also highlights the importance of electronic structure modulation.</description>

      <title>Synergistic structure engineering and electrochemical activation modulating vanadium oxide cathode toward superior zinc-ion storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153736</link>

                Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as competitive systems for grid-scale energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the lack of suitable high-performance cathode composites limits the practical progress of ZIBs. Herein, a novel cathode material, ammonium cation-inserted and oxygen vacancy co-modulated VO2 (named NVE), was firstly synthesized through the ethylene glycol (EG) sacrificial solvent-assisted structure transformation with the ammonium vanadate (named NV) as the precursor. The sacrificial solvent promotes the structural transformation of ammonium vanadate to NH4+-intercalated vanadium oxide and enhances the number of oxygen vacancies in the resulting material. Moreover, the electrochemical activation process was performed for in-situ construction of NH4+-inserted hydrated vanadium oxide (V2O5&#183;nH2O) material. The electrochemical activation process with high anodic voltage enables multiple electron reactions, increasing the utilization of vanadium elements and achieving high capacity. Additionally, the formed hydrogen bonds between the V-O host and inserted NH4+ ions can enhance the structural integrity, while the oxygen vacancies decrease the interaction between the V-O host and inserted Zn2+ ions to boost ion diffusion. Consequently, the resulting activated cathode demonstrates higher capacity (441 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g), superior cycling durability (85.6 % retention over 4000 cycles), and exceptional rate capability (205 mAh/g at 20 A/g). Besides, the fabricated devices based on the activated NVE cathode show decent capacity and excellent flexible stability. Furthermore, the reversible electrochemical Zn2+ storage mechanism upon battery cycling was evaluated by several kinetic measurements and in/ex-situ characterizations. This work provides novel perspectives for the fabrication of advanced cathode materials for superior aqueous ZIBs.</description>

                Nowadays, the inherent re-stacking nature and weak d-p hybridization orbital interactions within MXene remains significant challenges in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting, leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability. Herein, this work aims to address these challenges and improve electrocatalytic performance by utilizing cobalt nanoparticles intercalation coupled with enhanced &#960;-donation effect. Specifically, cobalt nanoparticles are integrated into V2C MXene nanosheets to mitigate the re-stacking issue. Meanwhile, a notable charge redistribution from cobalt to vanadium elevates orbital levels, reduces &#960;*-antibonding orbital occupancy and alleviates Jahn-Teller distortion. Doping with tellurium induces localized electric field rearrangement resulting from the changes in electron cloud density. As a result, Co-V2C MXene-Te acquires desirable activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with the overpotential of 80.8 mV and 287.7 mV, respectively, at the current density of &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mA cm&#8722;2. The overall water splitting device achieves an impressive low cell voltage requirement of 1.51 V to obtain 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Overall, this work could offer a promising solution when facing the re-stacking issue and weak d-p hybridization orbital interactions of MXene, furnishing a high-performance electrocatalyst with favorable electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability.</description>

                Abstract Morphology, crystal phase, and its transformation are important structures that frequently determine electrocatalytic activity, but the correlations of intrinsic activity with them are not completely understood. Herein, using Co(OH) 2 micro&#8208;platelets with well&#8208;defined structures (phase, thickness, area, and volume) as model electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction, multiple in situ microscopy is combined to correlate the electrocatalytic activity with morphology, phase, and its transformation. Single&#8208;entity morphology and electrochemistry characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy reveal a thickness&#8208;dependent turnover frequency (TOF) of &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 . The TOF (&#8776;9.5 s &#8722;1 ) of &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 with &#8776;14 nm thickness is &#8776;95&#8208;fold higher than that (&#8776;0.1 s &#8722;1 ) with &#8776;80 nm. Moreover, this thickness&#8208;dependent activity has a critical thickness of &#8776;30 nm, above which no thickness&#8208;dependence is observed. Contrarily, &#946;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 reveals a lower TOF (&#8776;0.1 s &#8722;1 ) having no significant correlation with thickness. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemistry with in situ Raman microspectroscopy, this thickness&#8208;dependent activity is explained by more reversible Co 3+ /Co 2+ kinetics and larger ratio of active Co sites of thinner &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 , accompanied with faster phase transformation and more extensive surface restructuration. The findings highlight the interactions among thickness, ratio of active sites, kinetics of active sites, and phase transformation, and offer new insights into structure&#8211;activity relationships at single&#8208;entity level.</description>

                Abstract One of the urgent challenges for efficient energy storage/conversion devices is the poor electrocatalytic activity and reversible operation capability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the air electrodes. Recently, tremendous efforts of high&#8208;entropy air electrodes are devoted, yet the performance enhancement is often ascribed to the high&#8208;entropy. Herein, the effects of the increase of configurational entropy and the selection of specifically doped elements are investigated on the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. These results suggest that the selection of doped elements may contribute more to enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability of air electrodes when compared with the increase of the configurational entropy. Accordingly, the optimized medium&#8208;entropy Pr 1/2 Ba 1/6 Sr 1/6 Ca 1/6 CoO 3&#8208;&#948; (PBSCC) electrode shows superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR and OER. A reversible solid oxide cell utilizing PBSCC demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, conveying a peak power density of 2.01 W cm &#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and a current density of 1.40 A cm &#8722;2 in electrolysis mode (under 50% H 2 O humidified H 2 at 1.3 V) at 750 &#176;C, while maintaining excellent cyclable operation stability for over 115 h.</description>

                The commercial viability of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of the electrode materials. In this study, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-&#948; (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx) with different Ni doping levels were synthesized. The results showed that increasing Ni doping led to the creation of more oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere resulted in a structural transformation into a composite with a heterogeneous interface between the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and an exsolved Ni-Fe metal alloy. The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell showed a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 &#176;C and 1.6 V, an improvement of 18% in comparison to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This study provides a strategy to synergistically improve the electrochemical reduction of CO2 activity of SOECs by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.</description>

      <title>Surface-Bound Formate Oxyanions Destabilize Hydration Layers to Pave OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; Transport Pathways for Oxygen Evolution</title>

                Sluggish mass transfer of OH&#8211; in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting from densely packed hydrated layers at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), becomes one of the main bottlenecks to improve overall efficiency of electrochemical devices. Herein, we report a hydration-layer-destabilizing route by binding formate oxyanions onto the catalyst surface to form OH&#8211; transport pathways, favorable for fast OH&#8211; transport and significantly improving OER activity. The electrochemical experiments indicate that surface formate-modified NiCo hydroxide (NiCo&#8211;HCOO&#8211;) shows increased OH&#8211; transfer kinetics, smaller overpotential, and higher turnover frequency (TOF) than that without surface formate modification. The theoretical calculations reveal that surface formate-induced hydrogen-bonding interaction with water molecules could destabilize densely packed hydrated potassium ion layers at the OHP, lowering OH&#8211; transport resistance and paving a pathway for OH&#8211; transfer. The assembled flow electrolyzer with the NiCo&#8211;HCOO&#8211; anode could operate at 400 mA cm&#8211;2 with only 2.1 V for over 300 h. This study provides an efficient strategy for designing high-activity OER electrocatalysts toward advanced energy conversion devices.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting produces green and pollution-free hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, which can effectively alleviate energy crisis. In this paper, bimetallic and selenium doped cobalt molybdate (Se-CoMoO4) nanosheets with rough surface are resoundingly prepared. The multihole Se-CoMoO4 nanosheets display ultrathin and rectangular architecture with the dimensions of &#8764; 3.5 &#956;m and 700 nm for length and width, respectively. The Se-CoMoO4 electrocatalyst shows remarkable water electrolysis activity and stability. The overpotentials of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 270 and 63.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, along with low Tafel slopes of 51.6 and 62.0 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the Se-CoMoO4 couple electrolyzer merely requires a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density and presents no apparent attenuation for 30 h. This investigation declares that the hybridization of transition bimetallic oxide with nonmetallic adulteration can afford a tactic for the preparation of bifunctional non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>A DFT investigation on surface and defect modulation of the Co3O4 catalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                The electrolysis of a water for hydrogen production is a promising way to produce clean energy, but the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. In this work, we investigated the water oxidation pathways on the perfect and defect Co3O4(111) surfaces by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that for the perfect surface the free energy barrier of the potential determining step (PDS) in the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) of water is lower than that in the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). For the defect surfaces, cobalt vacancies are more easily formed than oxygen vacancies. The Co vacancy promotes the formation of *OH, changes the PDS of the LOM and AEM, and reduces the free energy barrier of both PDS. The PDS of the LOM pathway on the VCo2-Co3O4(111) surface is the coupling step of the O adatom and lattice oxygen, which promotes the LOM process. Different from the OER mechanism on the perfect surface and the defect surface with Co vacancy, the LOM is perferred to occur on the defect surface with O vacancy. This work may provide new insight into the relationship between the surface structure and OER activity surface of the Co3O4 catalyst and help to design the efficient OER catalysts by surface and vacancy engineering.</description>

      <title>In Situ Hydroxide Growth over Nickel&#8211;Iron Phosphide with Enhanced Overall Water Splitting Performances</title>

                Abstract In this work, three dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;FeOH@Ni&#8208;FeP needle arrays with core&#8208;shell heterojunction structure are fabricated via in situ hydroxide growth over Ni&#8208;FeP surface. The as&#8208;prepared electrodes show an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, only requiring the low overpotential of 232 mV to reach 200 mA cm &#8722;2 with the Tafel slop of 40 mV dec &#8722;1 . For overall water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer with these electrodes only requires a cell voltage of 2.14 V to reach 1 A cm &#8722;2 . Mechanistic investigations for such excellent electrocatalytic performances are utilized by in situ Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The computation results present that Ni&#8208;FeOH@Ni&#8208;FeP attains better intrinsic conductivity and the D&#8208;band center (close to that of the ideal catalyst), thus giving superior excellent catalytic performances. Likewise, the surface Ni&#8208;FeOH layer can improve the structural stability of Ni&#8208;FeP cores and attenuate the eventual formation of irreversible FeOOH products. More importantly, the appearance of FeOOH intermediates can effectively decrease the energy barrier of NiOOH intermediates, and then rapidly accelerate the sluggish reaction dynamics, as well as further enhance the electrocatalytic activities, reversibility and cycling stability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Cathode Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401176</link>
      <description>Jie Dong, Danil W. Boukhvalov, Cuncai Lv, Mark G. Humphrey, Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400364048

                Due to their abundant active sites and porous structures, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the development of MOF-based electrocatalysts with efficient OER activity and excellent stability simultaneously still faces challenges. Herein, a cathodic activation strategy was used to enhance the OER electrocatalytic performance of M-HHTP for the first time, where M refers to Ni, Cu, Co, Fe, while HHTP denotes 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexahydroxytriphenylene. As a prototype, the activated Ni-HHTP (HA-Ni-HHTP) demonstrates outstanding OER performance, with an overpotential as low as 140 mV at 20 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 78.7 mV-1, surpassing commercial RuO2 and rivaling state-of-the-art MOFs-based electrocatalysts. Characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior performance of HA-Ni-HHTP is primarily ascribed to changes in semiconductor type, contact angle, and oxygen vacancy content induced by cathodic activation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis using the transmission line model confirms that cathodic activation accelerates charge transport, enhancing the OER process. Furthermore, the cathodic activation strategy holds promise for improving the water oxidation performance of other MOFs such as Fe-HHTP, Co-HHTP, and Cu-HHTP.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen is a fuel of the future that has the potential to replace conventional fossil fuels in several applications. The quickest and most effective method of producing pure hydrogen with no carbon emissions is water electrolysis. Developing highly active electrocatalysts is crucial due to the slow kinetics of oxygen and hydrogen evolution, which limit the usage of precious metals in water splitting. Interfacial engineering of heterostructures has sparked widespread interest in improving charge transfer efficiency and optimizing adsorption/desorption energetics. The emergence of a built&#8208;in&#8208;electric field between RuO 2 and MgFe&#8208;LDH improves the catalytic efficiency toward water splitting reaction. However, LDH&#8208;based materials suffer from poor conductivity, necessitating the design of 1D materials by integration of RuO 2 / MgFe&#8208;LDH to enhance catalytic properties through large surface areas and high electronic conductivity. Experimental results demonstrate lower overpotentials (273 and 122 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and remarkable stability (60 h) for the RuO 2 /MgFe&#8208;LDH/Fiber heterostructure in OER (1 m KOH) and HER (0.5 m H 2 SO 4 ) reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) unveils a synergistic mechanism at the RuO 2 /MgFe&#8208;LDH interface, leading to enhanced catalytic activity in OER and improved adsorption energy for hydrogen atoms, thereby facilitating HER catalysis.</description>

                Abstract Since 2020, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as robust catalysts for the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), benefiting from their distinct advantages. However, the current efficiency of H 2 O 2 production and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency (SCC) remain suboptimal due to various constraints in the reaction mechanism. Therefore, there is an imperative to propose efficiency improvement strategies to accelerate the development of this reaction system. This comprehensive review delineates recent advances, challenges, and strategies in utilizing COFs for photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production. It explores the fundamentals and challenges (e.g., oxygen (O 2 ) mass transfer rate, O 2 adsorption capacity, response to sunlight, electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency, charge transfer efficiency, selectivity, and H 2 O 2 desorption) associated with this process, as well as the advantages, applications, classification, and preparation strategies of COFs for this purpose. Various strategies to enhance the performance of COFs in H 2 O 2 production are highlighted. The review aims to stimulate further advancements in utilizing COFs for photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production and discusses potential prospects, challenges, and application areas in this field.</description>

      <title>Improving the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics in Zn&#8208;Air Battery by Iodide Oxidation Reaction</title>

                Abstract Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered considerable attention as a highly promising contender in the field of energy storage and conversion. Nevertheless, their performance is considerably impeded by the proliferation of dendrites on the Zinc anode and the slow kinetics of the redox reaction on the air cathode. Herein, taking Ag 30% @LaCoO 3 (Ag 30% @LCO) heterojunction catalyst as the cathode, it is demonstrated that adding KI additives to the alkaline electrolyte can not only enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic reaction but also inhibit the formation of zinc anode dendrites, thereby achieving a comprehensive improvement in the performance of ZABs. Under the action of the KI additive, the optimized Ag 30% @LCO catalyst shows a decreased overpotential from 460 to 220 mV at j = 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , while the assembled ZAB shows reduced charging potential (1.8 V), and long cycle stability (180 h). Furthermore, the morphology characterization results indicate a reduction in dendrites on the Zn anode. Both experimental and calculated results indicate that the presence of I &#8722; as a reaction modifier alters the trajectory of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in a more thermodynamically favorable pathway. The introduction of KI additives as electrolytes provides a straightforward approach to developing comprehensively improved ZABs.</description>

                We investigated the electrocatalytic properties of Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2, with 4.2&#8208;5.6 atomic % (at%) iridium. The Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 was synthesized by heating Ir/R&#8208;MnO2&#8208;formed via a surfactant&#8208;assisted (SA) method using KMnO4, IrCl3.H2O, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)&#8208;to 400 oC. The Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) was nano&#8208;sized based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), 5.6 at% Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) exhibited an overpotential ( of 327 &#177; 5 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. At 10 mA cm&#8208;2 , the Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) catalyzed the OER for 72 h at an of 534 mV. During this time there was a 12 % loss in Mn and 8 % loss in Ir from the structure. An IrO2 catalyst exhibited an initial &#951; of 420 &#177; 7 for the OER, but after 20 h of operation at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 there was a steep rise in potential (&gt;550 mV) and 12% loss in Ir. The enhanced activity and stability of Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) is attributed to the incorporation of Ir into the MnO2 lattice during synthesis and the formation of nano&#8208;sized particles using the SA method.</description>

                We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11 times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3M MgBr2 (at 0.6V) and up to 4&#8208;5 times higher adsorption capacity with 3M MgCl2 (at 1V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8208;20% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100 cycles of operation.</description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Oxygen-Doped g-C3N4 Mesoporous Nanosheets for Significant Enhancement of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17133345</link>

                In this work, oxygen-doped g-C3N4 mesoporous nanosheets (O-CNS) were synthesized via a facile recrystallization method with the assistance of H2O2. The crystal phase, chemical composition, morphological structure, optical property, electronic structure and electrochemical property of the prepared O-CNS samples were well investigated. The morphological observation combined with the nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption results demonstrated that the prepared O-CNS samples possessed nanosheet-like morphology with a porous structure. Doping O into g-C3N4 resulted in the augmentation of the specific surface area, which could provide more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Simultaneously, the visible light absorption capacity of O-CNS samples was boosted owing to the regulation of O doping. The built energy level induced by the O doping could accelerate the migration rate of photoinduced carriers, and the porous structure was most likely to speed up the release of hydrogen during the photocatalytic hydrogen process. Resultantly, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the optimized oxygen-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets reached up to 2012.9 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1, which was 13.4 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. Thus, the significantly improved photocatalytic behavior was imputed to the synergistic effect of the porous structure, the increase in active sites, and the enhancement of visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency. Our research highlights that the synergistic effect caused by element doping will make a great contribution to the remarkable improvement in photocatalytic activity, providing a new inspiration for the construction of novel catalysts.</description>

                Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP = polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000 h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits the metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Elevating Oxygen Evolution using Iron Phthalocyanine Infused Vanillic acid Electrocatalyst</title>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.e., (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2 current density in 1.0 M KOH . The designed catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Role of the Stoichiometry of Atomic Layer Deposited Nickel Cobalt Oxides on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202405188</link>

                Abstract Nickel cobalt oxides (NCOs) are promising, non&#8208;precious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, the stoichiometry&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior makes it crucial to understand the structure&#8208;OER relationship. In this work, NCO thin film model systems are prepared using atomic layer deposition. In&#8208;depth film characterization shows the phase transition from Ni&#8208;rich rock&#8208;salt films to Co&#8208;rich spinel films. Electrochemical analysis in 1 m KOH reveals a synergistic effect between Co and Ni with optimal performance for the 30 at.% Co film after 500 CV cycles. Electrochemical activation correlates with film composition, specifically increasing activation is observed for more Ni&#8208;rich films as its bulk transitions to the active (oxy)hydroxide phase. In parallel to this transition, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) increases up to a factor 8. Using an original approach, the changes in ECSA are decoupled from intrinsic OER activity, leading to the conclusion that 70 at.% Co spinel phase NCO films are intrinsically the most active. The studies point to a chemical composition dependent OER mechanism: Co&#8208;rich spinel films show instantly high activities, while the more sustainable Ni&#8208;rich rock&#8208;salt films require extended activation to increase the ECSA and OER performance. The results highlight the added value of working with model systems to disclose structure&#8208;performance mechanisms.</description>

                Water splitting is a promising technique for clean hydrogen production. To improve the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER is urgent to approach the scale-up applications of water splitting. Nowadays transition metal oxides (TMOs) are considered as the promising electrocatalysts due to their low cost, structural flexibility and stability, however, their electrocatalytic activities are eager to be improved. Here, we synthesized waxberry-like hydrophilic Co-doped ZnFe</description>

                Currently, a large number of studies on alkaline water electrolysis are being carried out with the aim of reducing the specific energy costs for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. This work is devoted to the methods of synthesis of highly dispersed composite coating on the surface of nickel foam and the methods of the formation of bi- and ternary catalytic alloys based on molybdenum using electrochemical deposition.

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three&#8208;dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.</description>

                Carbon Dots (CDs) have gained significant attention for their fascinating optical properties, potential applications, and puzzling structural challenges. In the last decade, CDs have become the focal point in many photocatalysis studies, either as independent systems or combined with other established photocatalysts. CDs play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of heterostructures for overall water splitting, hydrogen (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In these "Concepts," we briefly explore the structure of CDs, highlighting their critical aspects, including their role within heterostructures, composition, the presence of fluorophores, and the interaction between the graphitic core and surface functional groups. We will also examine how these factors impact their photocatalytic properties, particularly in the context of future research on H&#8322; production.</description>

                Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an innovative class of crystalline porous polymers composed of light elements such as C, N, O, etc., linked by covalent bonds. The distinctive properties of COFs, including designable building blocks, large specific surface area, tunable pore size, abundant active sites, and remarkable stability, have led their widespread applications in electrocatalysis. In recent years, COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts have made remarkable progress in various electrocatalytic fields, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This review begins with an introduction to the design and synthesis strategies employed for COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These strategies include heteroatom doping, metalation of COF and building monomers, encapsulation of active sites within COF pores, and the development of COF&#8208;based derived materials. Subsequently, a systematic overview of the recent advancements in the application of COF&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalysis is presented. Finally, the review discusses the main challenges and outlines possible avenues for the future development of COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Surface atomic bidirectional migration modulated electrocatalytic activity in Co2MnO4 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0214408</link>
      <description>Caiyun Qi, Baorui Xia, Xuebing Peng, Xingdong Jiang, Dongning Gao, Applied physics letters. 125(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400246119

                Polymetallic cationic spinel-type oxides are increasingly being used as catalysts for oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Here, we have modified the anti-spinel Co2MnO4 using a quenching strategy (CMO-Q) and demonstrated that the bidirectional migration of Co and Mn cations at the tetrahedral/octahedral positions is the essential reason for enhancing the ORR/OER performance. Electrochemical test results show that CMO-Q is better than Co2MnO4, OER initial potential decreased by 100 mV, and ORR current density increased from 4.2 to 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1600 rpm, with more stable CMO-Q-based zinc&#8211;air battery performance. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations confirm that the primary factor contributing to the reduction of distance from the d-band center of Co and Mn to the Fermi level is the conductivity enhancement. This study offers insight into regulating the surface atomic migration and catalytic performance of spinel without compromising its stable structure.</description>

                Anthropogenic activities related to population growth, economic development, technological advances, and changes in lifestyle and climate patterns result in a continuous increase in energy consumption. At the same time, the rare metal elements frequently deployed as catalysts in energy related processes are not only costly in view of their low natural abundance, but their availability is often further limited due to geopolitical reasons. Thus, electrochemical energy storage and conversion with earth-abundant metals, mainly in the form of single-atom catalysts (SACs), are highly relevant and timely technologies. In this review the application of earth-abundant SACs in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalytic conversion of chemicals to fuels or products with high energy content is discussed. The oxygen reduction reaction is also appraised, which is primarily harnessed in fuel cell technologies and metal-air batteries. The coordination, active sites, and mechanistic aspects of transition metal SACs are analyzed for two-electron and four-electron reaction pathways. Further, the electrochemical water splitting with SACs toward green hydrogen fuel is discussed in terms of not only hydrogen evolution reaction but also oxygen evolution reaction. Similarly, the production of ammonia as a clean fuel via electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction is portrayed, highlighting the potential of earth-abundant single metal species.</description>

      <title>The g-C3N4/CdO Heterojunction as an Efficient Photo-electron Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2024.416269</link>

                The electronic, optical, and photo-electro catalytic properties of the g-C3N4/CdO(CGN/CdO) heterojunction are studied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The CGN/CdO heterojunction has a staggered band structure and indirect bandgap (1.976 eV), following the S-scheme mechanism. The absorption spectra of the heterojunction are substantially red-shifted and the absorption coefficients are significantly higher relative to the intrinsic g-C3N4(GCN) and intrinsic CdO. In addition, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 14.21 %. The photo-catalytic water decomposition can occur at pH = 0&#8211;14. The &#951;STH of the GCN/CdO heterojunction is up to 31.82 %, and it is modulated to 36.14 % under &#8722;4 % biaxial strain modulation. The low over-potential of the Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the heterojunction is 0.905 V obtained at the GCN layer, and that of the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is &#8722;0.498 V occurred at the CdO layer. These findings suggest that the GCN/CdO heterojunction has an efficient photo-electro catalytic potential for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Emerging Cost-Efficient Aluminum-Air Battery Technology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003310174-20</link>

                Considering the thriving demand for energy and efficient energy storage technology, there has been a high demand for high-capacity batteries. Lithium-ion batteries, being commercially explored, have reached an energy density of ~100&#8211;200 Wh kg&#8722;1, which is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of electric vehicles (EVs). The abundance, safety, cost-effectiveness, and high energy density of a three-electron transfer process make aluminum a candidate for the realization of metal-air battery technology, which is named an aluminum-air battery. The high theoretical energy density of 8,100 Wh kg&#8722;1 with material abundance upgrades aluminum-air batteries as a prime candidate for powering electric vehicles. However, the commercialization of AAB is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction at the air-cathode. Moreover, the self-corrosive nature of aluminum anode, with parasitic reaction and evolution of hydrogen, impedes the electrochemical performance. Air cathode being a critical part suffers from many challenges such as clogging of pores by the insoluble products such as carbonates in the alkaline electrolyte, electrode resistance, overvoltage, limited availability of surface area for catalytic adsorption, and cost considerations, impeding the development. The introduction of nanomaterials and doped carbonaceous materials has proven the effect on accelerating the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution activity. For the realization of high-performance AABs, designing and developing newer cathodes and electrocatalysts are unequivocally important. Continuous efforts, which are underway on engineering air-cathode, explicitly promote aluminum-air batteries toward the realization of powering electric vehicles.</description>

                MoS2 is a potential transition metal sulfide (TMS) with excellent performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. However, MoS2 has poor stability owing to its metastable properties and therefore is easily oxidized to MoO3 which can hinder the HER process. In this work, MoO3 on the surface of the TMS is transformed to NiMoO4 with plentiful oxygen vacancies (Ov) favorable for HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by an acid treatment to form an Ov-containing transition bimetallic sulfide/oxide catalyst (Ov-NiMoO4@Ni3S2-MoS2-rGO-NF, denoted as NiMoO4@NiMoS-rN). The electrocatalyst shows exceptional performance for HER and OER in terms of increased intrinsic activity, electron transfer efficiency, reaction kinetics and durability on account of the Ov, synergistic effect among different phases and bimetallic active sites. The overpotentials of NiMoO4@NiMoS-rN electrode when achieving 10 mA cm-2 are 45 mV and 195 mV towards HER and OER in alkaline, respectively, and the performance holds nearly unchanged during a 50-hour stability test. When assembled to a two-electrode system, the current density of 10 mA cm-2 can keep steady for 50 h without degradation. The strategy combined by phase transition, interface and defect engineering via a facile method provides a practical idea for design and modulation of bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Mo and W Single Atoms Co-Doped Surface Hydroxylated NiFe Oxide as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124356</link>

                Two novel defect engineering strategies, surface hydroxylation and single atom (SA) doping, are explored to fabricate a high performance bifunctional water electrolysis catalyst, synergistic Mo and W SAs co-doped surface hydroxylated NiFe oxide (FN-MoWact). The product catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 196 and 246 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and decent overpotentials of 79 and 246 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. For overall water splitting, the FN-MoWact//FN-MoWact couple requires ultralow cell voltages of 1.504 and 1.729 V to deliver current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, and remains stable after a 100-hour operation at an initial current density of 534 mA cm-2. The enhanced electrocatalytic activities are attributed to surface hydroxylation and doping of synergistic Mo and W SAs. The two defect engineering modifications, as supported by analyses of density functional theory calculations and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, lead to a proper reduction in metal-oxygen covalency, thus minimizing the energy difference of the rate-determining step of the OER process, and create surface active sites with a d-band center located closer to the Fermi level, thus properly strengthening proton binding to enhance HER activities.</description>

                Metal&#8211;organic frameworks have garnered attention as highly efficient pre-electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Current structure&#8211;activity relationships primarily rely on the assumption that the complete dissolution of organic ligands occurs during electrocatalysis. Herein, modeling based on NiFe Prussian blue analogs (NiFe-PBAs) show that cyanide ligands leach from the matrix and subsequently oxidize to corresponding inorganic ions (ammonium and carbonate) that re-adsorb onto the surface of NiFe OOH during the OER process. Interestingly, the surface-adsorbed inorganic ions induce the OER reaction of NiFe OOH to switch from the adsorbate evolution to the lattice-oxygen&#8211;mediated mechanism, thus contributing to the high activity. In addition, this reconstructed inorganic ion layer acting as a versatile protective layer can prevent the dissolution of metal sites to maintain contact between catalytic sites and reactive ions, thus breaking the activity&#8211;stability trade-off. Consequently, our constructed NiFe-PBAs exhibit excellent durability for 1250 h with an ultralow overpotential of 253 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. The scale-up NiFe-PBAs operated with a low energy consumption of &#8764;4.18 kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in industrial water electrolysis equipment. The economic analysis of the entire life cycle demonstrates that this green hydrogen production is priced at US$2.59/kgH2, meeting global targets (&lt;US$2.5/kgH2).</description>

      <title>Rapid Charge Extraction via Hole Transfer Layer and Interfacial Coordination Bonds on Hematite Photoanode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

                Enhancing carrier separation and transport efficiency to achieve efficient water oxidation reaction is an important issue in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting field, and introducing hole transfer layer (HTL) is an effective strategy to improve it. However, the difficulty of charge transfer between HTL and oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is a problem unresolved. To ameliorate the situation, we choose CoOOH as HTL and the metal&#8211;organic coordination compound constructed by 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (IA) and Co/Ni ions as OEC. Using the interfacial coordination bonds as carrier transfer channels, the holes were rapidly extracted from HTL to OEC containing abundant active sites and participate in oxidation reaction. In consequence, the unique design results in a photocurrent density of 2.97 times that of &#945;-Fe2O3 at 1.23 VRHE for the IACN/CoOOH/Fe2O3. This study reveals how the advisable design of photoanode promotes interfacial charge transfer and provides a valuable reference for the design of composite photoanode.</description>

                As a typical VOCs emitted from petrochemical industry, chlorobenzene was selected to study its removal by wet oxidation with electrochemical catalysis. Ti based IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode was used in the advanced oxidation of chlorobenzene, and Sn, Sb, Pt and La were used to modify Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5. Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-La showed the highest removal rate of chlorobenzene and it reached 99.2% for the chlorobenzene oxidation, which was 20% higher than those of the other 3 additions. Oxygen evolution overpotential of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-La increased to 1.17 V when compared with Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 of 1.08 V. EPR tests for free radicals and GC-MS tests for intermediates showed that the main active substance was &#183;OH, and the element Cl in chlorobenzene dissociated from the benzene ring under the action with &#183;OH to form &#183;Cl and ClO&#183; radicals. Degradation pathway of chlorobenzene was figured out as chlorobenzene&#8594; phenols&#8594; organic acids&#8594; CO2+H2O.</description>

                Renewable electrical energy for electrolysis water can achieve green industrial chains for hydrogen production. However, finding efficient electrocatalysts remains a challenge for green hydrogen. Herein, sub-nanometric FeCoP nanosheets with average thickness of 0.9 nm is constructed through 2D self-assembly driven by cavitation effect of ultrasonics and following phosphating. Benefiting from abundant active sites, enhanced H2O molecular adsorption kinetics, and highly enhanced structural stability, the subcrystalline FeCoP shows excellent electrocatalytic activities of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Ultralow overpotential of 37 mV is achieved at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 for HER. When the FeCoP catalyst was used as both cathode and anode for overall water splitting using renewable electrical energy, green hydrogen produced is directly applied for hydrogen fuel cell to drive fan for more than 10 h. Theoretical calculation indicates that subcrystalline FeCoP more easily adsorbs H2O than crystalline one and thus speeds up the kinetics of Volmer step in HER process.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity on transition metal (TM) catalysts is governed by OER mechanism, yet discovering a controllable parameter to custom&#8208;tailor OER mechanism remains a challenge. Here, the study highlights an e g electron&#8208;filling state in octahedral TM&#8208;catalysts, achieved by the modulation of splitting energy (&#916;) via different anions (R) (Cl &#8722; , PO 4 3&#8722; , NO 3 &#8722; , F &#8722; , SO 4 2&#8722; , CO 3 2&#8722; ). The e g &#8208; electron filling state customization predominantly arises from the adjustment of Co&#8208; d z 2 orbital energy, which can tailor the bandgap between Co&#8208; d z 2 and O&#8208; p orbits (&#916;&#949; d&#8208;p ), thus customizing lattice&#8208;oxygen (O L ) activities and the OER mechanism. Combining the experimental measurements with DFT calculations, it is concluded that increased e g electron in TM&#8208;catalysts brings decreased &#916;&#949; d&#8208;p , which can manageably strengthen lattice&#8208;oxygen reactivity. Consequently, the OER mechanism on TM catalyst is transformed from adsorbate precipitation mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) and customized OER pathways with different lattice&#8208;oxygen activities. The screened PO 4 3&#8208;_ TM, with the optimal O L activity in LOM path, possesses excellent activity and stability, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at 236 mV overpotential and maintaining stable operation for 300 h with inapparent degradation at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 .</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Construction of Interfacial Akagan&#233;ite FeOOH Phase to Enable the Long&#8208;Term Stability of Nickel&#8208;Iron Hydroxides for Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>

                Abstract NiFe&#8208;based hydroxides are well&#8208;established as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline purified water. However, they usually degrade rapidly in seawater electrolysis because of concentrated Cl &#8722; anions in seawater. In this work, a facile approach utilizing an ultrafast dipping method is presented to fabricate durable and scalable NiFe hydroxides, enhanced by interfacial akagan&#233;ite FeOOH for seawater splitting. This study reveals significantly improved electrocatalytic stability of NiFe hydroxides at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 for 100 h in alkaline seawater. It is realized by the formed FeOOH in a specific akagan&#233;ite phase whose lattice tunnels are well filled by intrinsic Cl &#8722; anions, that serve to electrostatically repel corrosive chlorides in electrolyte. This anionic design also provides superior corrosion protection for other active metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts when deployed in alkaline purified water and allows for facile scaling up of the anode, facilitating the practical utilization for seawater electrolysis.</description>

                As the commercialized lithium-ion battery (LIB) approaches to reach the ceiling in energy density, the possibilities for post-LIB systems have gained wide acceptance. In this regard, a lithium-air battery (LAB) has its own uniqueness in high values of energy density as 3,500 Wh kg&#8722;1, which is ten-fold larger than a LIB. In the past two decades, there have been many developments in the electrochemical performance of the LAB; however, developments are plagued by many fundamental bottleneck challenges. Metallic lithium, being employed as an anode, is severely corroded by side reactions, dendrites growth, and unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interface. Furthermore, electrolyte degradation can be possible by the electrochemical reaction intermediates (LiO2, O2&#8722;, O2, O22&#8722;). The insulating nature of discharge products and their insolubility and deposition over the air cathode lead to lowering the cycle life. In addition, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction also impede the acceptance of LABs. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, unveiling the electrochemical aspects needs prime importance. Strategies to engineer anode, tailoring cathode, and catalyst and electrolyte modifications are the approaches. Optimizing the cell components and stabilizing electrochemistry rectify the challenges and accelerate the momentum of development, promoting the industrial viability of LABs.</description>

                Engineering the hole transfer layer is a promising approach to suppress the bulk charge recombination of photoanodes for enhancing solar water splitting performance. Herein, functional cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic phosphide (CoMoP) layer are inserted between bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and NiFeOx oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) as hole transfer layer to construct an integrated photoanode (NiFeOx/CoMoP/BiVO4). This state-of-the-art NiFeOx/CoMoP/BiVO4 photoanode not only achieves a superior photocurrent density of 5.82 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), but also an outstanding 60 hours long-term photostability (100 mW/cm2). Such excellent PEC performance can be attributed to the engineering CoMoP hole layer in NiFeOx/BiVO4, promoting hole transfer, retarding bulk charge recombination and accelerating the surface water oxidation kinetics. This study contributes to the role of the hole transfer layer and sheds light on the development of effective and stable photoanodes for PEC water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Electrolysis of water for producing hydrogen is an effective and sustainable technique to meet the continuously increasing energy demand. Nevertheless, its advancement is impeded by the inadequate catalytic efficacy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Vacancy defect engineering is a rational approach to simultaneously enhance the catalytic performance for both the half-reactions. However, controlling the vacancy defects is quite challenging. Here, we have employed a radio-frequency Ar plasma-assisted treatment strategy to prepare highly efficient graphene-supported FeNi 2 S 4 bifunctional catalysts with abundant vacancies. The plasma treatment induces the formation of vacancy structures in the catalyst, modifying the free energy of reaction intermediates, surface morphology, and electronic structure as well as reducing the reaction barriers, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. The optimized graphene-supported FeNi 2 S 4 catalyst possesses abundant sulfur vacancies, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance. At 50 mA cm -2 , the overpotentials for OER and HER are 240 and 256 mV, respectively, indicating exceptional stability. Overall, this work offers valuable insights into the development of cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.</description>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key reactions in numerous renewable energy devices. Unlike conventional powdered catalysts, self-supported catalysts are extensively employed in oxygen electrocatalysis because of the enhanced electron-transfer rate, high specific surface area, and superior mechanical flexibility. Among the self-supported conductive substrates, carbon fiber usually exhibits several distinctive advantages, such as a straightforward preparation process, relatively low cost, good stability, and excellent conductivity. Against this background, carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts have been widely applied and studied in oxygen electrocatalysis, indicating a promising development direction in oxygen electrocatalyst research. Thus, it is essential to offer an overall summary of the research progress in this field to facilitate its subsequent development. Taking the regulatory mechanisms and modification methods as a starting point, this review comprehensively summarizes recent research on carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts in recent years. Firstly, a brief overview of the synthesis methods and regulatory mechanisms of carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts is given. Furthermore, the view also highlights the modification methods and research progress of self-supported electrocatalysts synthesized on carbon fiber-based substrates in recent years in terms of different dopant atoms. Finally, the prospects for the application of self-supported electrocatalysts based on carbon fiber in oxygen electrocatalysis and the possible future directions of their development are presented. This review summarizes recent developments and applications of self-supported bi-functional electrocatalysts with carbon fiber-based materials as the conducting substrate in oxygen electrocatalysis. It also lays a robust scientific foundation for the subsequent reasonable design of highly effective carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts.</description>

                Electrochemical seawater splitting is a potential approach to producing H2 and O2. As seawater contains different cations and anions, the direct electrochemical splitting of seawater suffers from various challenges like chlorine evolution, corrosion of electrodes, and poor stability for the catalysts. Herein, we have demonstrated the incorporation of 4d-metal ion Ru3+ in Prussian blue analogue-derived Ru&#8211;NiFe(O)OH (at the anode) and Ru&#8211;NiFe(OH)2 (at the cathode) nanosheets for electrochemical seawater splitting. The introduction of Ru3+ into the active catalysts modulated the electronic structure to improve the cell voltage, reaction kinetics, and stability for seawater splitting. In real seawater, the anodically reconstructed Ru&#8211;NiFe(O)OH nanosheets reached 50 mA cm&#8211;2 current density at a 260 mV overpotential for oxygen evolution, while Ru&#8211;NiFe(OH)2 at the cathode attained &#8722;50 mA cm&#8211;2 current density for hydrogen evolution at only an 83 mV overpotential. The coupling of Ru&#8211;NiFe(O)OH and Ru&#8211;NiFe(OH)2 nanosheets as the anode and cathode, respectively, produced 50 mA cm&#8211;2 current density at a cell voltage of 1.58 V for overall seawater splitting, outperforming the RuO2&#8741;Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, 100 h stability was also achieved for the overall seawater splitting.</description>

                Abstract Designing integrated overall water&#8208;splitting catalysts that maintain high efficiency and stability under various conditions is an important trend for future development, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, novel nanoflower&#8208;like tri&#8208;metallic Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo phosphide catalyst ((Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo)P@F&#8208;CDs), integrated with F&#8208;doped carbon dots (F&#8208;CDs), were synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal process and subsequent phosphatization. Attributable to precise interface engineering and electronic structure optimization, (Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo)P@F&#8208;CDs exhibit exceptional bi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in alkaline conditions, achieving remarkably low overpotentials of 231 and 123 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, at a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Industrially, only 1.426 V is needed for the same efficacy. Additionally, the catalyst requires merely 1.508 and 1.564 V for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH and simulated seawater, respectively, at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . The catalyst also shows excellent stability, with minimal performance decline over 100 h within 100&#8211;200 mA cm &#8722;2 . Density functional theory calculations indicate that the interface structure synergistically optimizes Gibbs free energy for H* and O* intermediates during HER and OER, respectively, accelerating electrochemical water&#8208;splitting kinetics.</description>

                The electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) plays a crucial role in electrochemical hydrogen production and direct ethanol fuel cells, both vital for utilizing renewable energies. Ni-based catalysts are pivotal in enabling efficient EOR, leading to the formation of acetic acid/acetaldehyde or CO2. These can serve as alternative anodic oxidation reactions for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis or the anodic reaction for direct ethanol fuel cells, respectively. This review explores recent advancements in EOR over Ni-based catalysts. It begins with an overview of EOR performance across various Ni-based catalysts, followed by an examination of the reaction chemistry, mechanism, and active sites. The review then delves into strategies for designing highly active Ni-based EOR catalysts. These strategies include promotion with transition metals, noble metals, nonmetals, and carbon materials, as well as creating amorphous structures, special morphologies, and single-atom catalysts. Additionally, it discusses the concept of self-supporting catalysts using three-dimensional porous substrates. Finally, the review highlights emerging methodologies that warrant further exploration, along with future directions for designing highly active and stable EOR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Electrolytes for Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003310167-14</link>

                Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are one of the promising candidates for the large-scale energy storage. A major component in the VRFBs is electrolytes, whose properties will affect the electrochemical performance, efficiency, and overall cost. In spite of the fact that VRFBs electrolytes are remarkably evolved, they should improve toward reliable, stable, efficient, and cost-effective VRFBs. The use of the same element in different oxidation states eliminates the possibility of cross-contamination. Although the use of hydrochloric acid increases solubility, the hazardous elimination of chlorine gas becomes a problem. While using sulfuric acid as a supporting electrolyte, short range of operational temperature causes additional loss in energy and increases the cost. To increase the overall performances, many additives can be used. Studies were conducted to use sodium chloride as a cheap additive. For more output voltage, nonaqueous electrolytes are preferred over aqueous electrolytes. Vanadium ion and water crossover across the membrane, air oxidation, and hydrogen and oxygen evolution also affect the overall performances of the vanadium redox flow batteries. In recent studies, seawater is used as an alternative for deionized water to reduce the cost of production. The seawater not only reduces the cost of production, but also increases Columbic efficiency and capacity retention.</description>

                Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells have been extensively studied in water splitting to produce H2, but the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a huge challenge. Here, we reported a PEC strategy for biomass-derived succinic acid decarboxylation to replace OER, with the production of ethylene (C2H4) as a high-demand chemical. By synthesizing a bismuth oxide supported on titanium oxide (BiOx/TiO2) as the photoanode, C2H4 was efficiently produced with 85.7 &#956;mol/h production rate and 40% Faradaic efficiency. Simultaneously, H2 productivity was improved by 6.5-fold compared with total water splitting (from 50.8 to 331.7 &#956;mol/h). Structure characterizations show that BiOx forms an ultrathin layer (approximately 1.5 nm in thickness) on the TiO2 surface with a strong interfacial interaction, inducing the formation of a type-II heterojunction with efficient charge separation and transfer. Experimental data suggest that succinic acid molecules are adsorbed over the BiOx surface with its dual carboxyl groups in a deprotonated form, facilitating the decarboxylation of succinic acid to ethylene via a non-Kolbe route. This work demonstrates the great opportunity of PEC technology for transforming renewable biomass resources into value-added chemicals with promoted H2 fuel production under mild conditions.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt single atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited promising performance in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), positioning them as potential dual&#8208;functional catalysts for Zn&#8208;air battery. However, the long&#8208;standing challenge lies in achieving satisfactory dual&#8208;functionality and stability of these SACs. In this study, to optimize the 4e &#8210; ORR performance, boron (B) atoms are employed with low electronegativity to regulate the structure of the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C catalytic center. This resulted in the formation of an asymmetrically coordinated Co metal center catalyst (Co&#8208;N 3 B). Compared to the Co&#8208;N 4 , Co&#8208;N 3 B exhibited lower free energy for ORR and stronger adsorption energy toward * O species, effectively suppressing the 2e &#8210; ORR pathway at the cobalt site and preventing catalyst corrosion induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in ORR reactions, thereby enhancing catalyst stability. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) further validated excellent interaction between Co active centers and O intermediates. Furthermore, the self&#8208;made rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrated remarkable discharge peak power density (&#8776;253 mW cm &#8210;2 ), energy density (&#8776;819 mAh g &#8210;1 ), and cyclic stability exceeding 110 h. This study provides new insights into constructing catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and offers strong references for practical applications in energy storage and convension electrocatalysts.</description>

      <description>Aviraj M. Teli, Rajneesh Kumar Mishra, Jae Cheol Shin, Woo-Yong Jeon, Micromachines. 15(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400292758

                Herein, we prepare MoS2 and Cu-MoS2 catalysts using the solvothermal method, a widely accepted technique for electrocatalytic overall water-splitting applications. TEM and SEM images, standard tools in materials science, provide a clear view of the morphology of Cu-MoS2. HRTEM analysis, a high-resolution imaging technique, confirms the lattice spacing, lattice plane, and crystal structure of Cu-MoS2. HAADF and corresponding color mapping and advanced imaging techniques reveal the existence of the Cu-doping, Mo, and S elements in Cu-MoS2. Notably, Cu plays a crucial role in improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the Cu-MoS2 catalyst as compared with the MoS2 catalyst. In addition, the Cu-MoS2 catalyst demonstrates significantly lower overpotential (167.7 mV and 290 mV) and Tafel slopes (121.5 mV dec&#8722;1 and 101.5 mV dec&#8722;1), standing at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER, respectively, compared to the MoS2 catalyst. Additionally, the Cu-MoS2 catalyst displays outstanding stability for 12 h at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 of HER and 12 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 of OER using chronopotentiaometry. Interestingly, the Cu-MoS2&#8214;Cu-MoS2 cell displays a lower cell potential of 1.69 V compared with the MoS2&#8214;MoS2 cell of 1.81 V during overall water splitting. Moreover, the Cu-MoS2&#8214;Cu-MoS2 cell shows excellent stability when using chronopotentiaometry for 18 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

                To facilitate the transition from a carbon-energy-dependent society to a sustainable society, conventional engineering strategies, which encounter limitations associated with intrinsic material properties, should undergo the paradigm shift. From a theoretical viewpoint, the spin-dependent feature of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveals the potential of a spin-polarization strategy in enhancing the performance of electrochemical (EC) reactions. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon attracts unprecedented attention owing to its potential utility in achieving novel breakthroughs. This paper starts with the experimental results aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the spin-dependent OER focusing on the EC system based on the CISS phenomenon. The applicability of spin-polarization to EC system is verified through various analytical methodologies to clarify the theoretical groundwork and mechanisms underlying the spin-dependent reaction pathway. The discussion is then extended to effective spin-control strategies in photoelectrochemical system based on the CISS effect. Exploring the influence of spin-state control on the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects, this perspective also discusses the effect of spin polarization induced by the CISS phenomenon on spin-dependent OER. Lastly, future directions for enhancing the performance of spin-dependent redox systems are discussed, including expansion to various chemical reactions and the development of materials with spin-control capabilities.</description>

      <title>Galvanostatic Electroshock Synthesis of Low Loading Au&#8208;Pt Nanoalloys onto Gas Diffusion Electrodes as Multifunctional Electrocatalysts for a Glycerol&#8208;Fed Electrolyzer</title>

                Water electrolysis is increasingly considered a viable solution for meeting the world&#8217;s growing energy demands and mitigating environmental issues. An inventive strategy to mitigate the energy requirements involves substituting the energy&#8208;intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with biomass&#8208;derived glycerol electrooxidation. Nonetheless, the synthesis of electrocatalysts for controlling the selectivity towards added&#8208;value chemicals at the anode and efficient H2 generation at the cathode remains a critical bottleneck. Herein, we implemented a galvanostatic electroshock synthesis approach to control the reduction kinetics of Au(III) and Pt(IV) to grow ultra&#8208;low amount of gold&#8208;platinum alloys on a gas diffusion electrode (12&#8208;26 &#181;gmetal cm&#8210;2) for glycerol&#8208;fed hydroxide anion exchange membrane based electrolyzer. The symmetric GDE&#8208;Au100&#8208;xPtx||GDE&#8208;Au100&#8208;xPtx systems showed a notable improvement in electrolyzer performance (GDE&#8208;Au64Pt36 = 201 mA cm&#8722;2) as compared to monometallic versions (GDE&#8208;Au100Pt0 = 18 mA cm&#8722;2, GDE&#8208;Au0Pt100 = 81 mA cm&#8722;2). Chromatography (HPLC) analysis underscores the critical importance of bulk electrolysis methodology (galvanostatic vs potentiostatic) for the efficient conversion of glycerol into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Regarding the electrical energy required to produce 1 kg of H2 for such an electrolyzer fed at the anode with glycerol, our results confirm a drastic decrease by a factor of at least two compared with conventional water electrolysis.</description>

                Complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques can be created through 3D printing today. This method can lead to improved performance and novel designs for gas diffusion electrode (GDE) substrates. In this study, GDE samples are prepared by the 3D printing method and subjected to Pt coating with varying thicknesses using the electron beam evaporation (E-beam) method. GDE samples are denoted BM-C0 (bare), BM-C1 (0.20 &#956;m Cr + 0.20 &#956;m Pt), and BM-C2 (0.20 &#956;m Cr + 0.45 &#956;m Pt). After the coating process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the GDEs is examined in 0.5 M H2SO4. The maximum current density value is obtained as 77.86 mA/cm2 at 1.7 V from the BM-C2 sample. A change in the charge transfer coefficient has been determined in the Tafel curves, resulting from the partial oxidation of Pt. It is determined that the best charge-transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface belongs to the BM-C2 electrode among the GDE samples. According to LSV results, it is revealed that the electrochemical performance of the BM-C2 sample is 14.01 times more improved compared to other GDEs. Furthermore, it is anticipated that a Pt-coated thin film could significantly enhance the performance of GDEs to achieve a competitive performance level in energy conversion devices.</description>

                Surface area, pore properties, synergistic behavior, homogenous dispersion, and interactions between carbon matrix and metal&#8208;nanostructures are the key factors for achieving the better performance of carbon&#8208;metal based (electro)catalysts. However, the traditional hydro&#8208; or solvothermal preparation of (electro)catalysts, particularly, bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic nanostructures anchored graphene (G) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), often pose to poor metal&#8211;support interaction, low synergism, and patchy dispersion. At first, bimetallic flower&#8208;like&#8208;CuFeS 2 /NG and cube&#8208;like&#8208;NiFeS 2 /NCNTs nanocomposites were prepared by solvothermal method. The resultant bimetallic nanocomposites were employed to derive the 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW (electro)catalyst by a very simple and green urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method. The desired physicochemical properties of Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW such as multiple active sites, strong metal&#8208;support interaction, homogenous dispersion and enhanced surface area were confirmed by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method for preparing 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;based (electro)catalysts. The Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW was found to be highly effective for alkaline&#8208;mediated oxygen evolution reaction at low onset potential of 284.24 mV, and the stable current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH for 10 h. Further, the Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol with good k app value of 87.71 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 s &#8722;1 and excellent reusability over five cycles. Overall, the developed urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method is highly efficient for the preparation of metal&#8208;nanoarchitectures anchored 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched (electro)catalysts with high synergism, uniform dispersion and excellent metal&#8208;support interaction.</description>

      <title>A gene for all seasons: The evolutionary consequences of HIF-1 in carcinogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2024.06.003</link>
      <description>Ranjini Bhattacharya, Joel S. Brown, Robert A. Gatenby, Arig Ibrahim&#8208;Hashim, Seminars in cancer biology. 102-103(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400279205

                Oxygen played a pivotal role in the evolution of multicellularity during the Cambrian Explosion. Not surprisingly, responses to fluctuating oxygen concentrations are integral to the evolution of cancer-a disease characterized by the breakdown of multicellularity. Poorly organized tumor vasculature results in chaotic patterns of blood flow characterized by large spatial and temporal variations in intra-tumoral oxygen concentrations. Hypoxia-inducible growth factor (HIF-1) plays a pivotal role in enabling cells to adapt, metabolize, and proliferate in low oxygen conditions. HIF-1 is often constitutively activated in cancers, underscoring its importance in cancer progression. Here, we argue that the phenotypic changes mediated by HIF-1, in addition to adapting the cancer cells to their local environment, also "pre-adapt" them for proliferation at distant, metastatic sites. HIF-1-mediated adaptations include a metabolic shift towards anaerobic respiration or glycolysis, activation of cell survival mechanisms like phenotypic plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming, and formation of tumor vasculature through angiogenesis. Hypoxia induced epigenetic reprogramming can trigger epithelial to mesenchymal transition in cancer cells-the first step in the metastatic cascade. Highly glycolytic cells facilitate local invasion by acidifying the tumor microenvironment. New blood vessels, formed due to angiogenesis, provide cancer cells a conduit to the circulatory system. Moreover, survival mechanisms acquired by cancer cells in the primary site allow them to remodel tissue at the metastatic site generating tumor promoting microenvironment. Thus, hypoxia in the primary tumor promoted adaptations conducive to all stages of the metastatic cascade from the initial escape entry into a blood vessel, intravascular survival, extravasation into distant tissues, and establishment of secondary tumors.</description>

      <title>Dissolved oxygen affinities of hundreds of benthic foraminiferal species</title>

                Over the past decades, fossil assemblages of benthic foraminifera have been used to reconstruct the variability of oxygen-depleted areas, including oxygen minimum zones. These areas currently represent almost a tenth of the global oceans' surface area, and further expansion is expected due to global warming; with major impacts on marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and fisheries. To predict their future evolution, accurate estimates and quantification of past oceanic oxygenation are needed, and thus consistent calibration of the O2 estimation transfer functions is required. Here, we combine the BENFEP database that compiles all the benthic foraminiferal census data published for the East Pacific Ocean, with dissolved oxygen data interpolated from the WOA18 and GLODAPV2.2022 databases, to describe the oxygen affinities of the 1526 benthic foraminiferal taxa from the BENFEP database among 1691 samples. The affinities of the most common 202 species of the database are detailed here. For each of these taxa, the range of oxygen concentration, average O2 value where the species is usually found, and O2 value associated with its peak in relative abundance are listed and used to assign each taxon to the oxygen categories anoxic, dysoxic, suboxic, low oxic, and high oxic. Finally, using the relative abundance of each of these five oxygen assemblages and their associated taxa, transfer function indices of dissolved oxygen estimation were refined. The new BFAex extends the range of applicability of the formerly published BFA index, here updated using all the available samples BFAup and extended from 0.04 to 2.58 mL L&#8722;1 to 0.02&#8211;6.62 mL L&#8722;1.</description>

      <description>Adam Swanger, Raymond H. Fernando, Colin Mahony, R. N. Carro, A. W. Harrison, IOP conference series. Materials science and engineering. 1301(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400360221

                Abstract Since 2018, NASA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have been developing a liquid oxygen storage module (LOXSM) based on the NASA patent-pending Cryogenic Flux Capacitor (CFC) technology. LOXSM&#8217;s could potentially replace the gaseous or chemical-based oxygen supply in current closed-circuit escape respirators (CCER), with reducing CCER size being a primary goal. By virtue of the CFC functionality, cryogenic oxygen stored within the LOXSM is released in response to heat input, ideally from the breathing loop. Prior efforts focused on the oxygen storage potential of silica aerogel materials that the CFC utilizes, and were previously reported. Current work explored the LOXSM&#8217;s potential to remove and retain CO 2 produced by the CCER user, in conjunction with oxygen generation, creating a synergy that may be exploited to reduce or eliminate the chemical CO 2 absorber used in current CCERs. A test program for determining CO 2 retention is presented, as well as the evolution of LOXSM prototypes. Testing showed that it is possible to completely remove CO 2 out of an effluent stream at the flowrate required for the capacity of the CCER for an appreciable time, and that the LOXSM prototype design progression had a positive effect on that duration.</description>

                Abstract In situ exploration of the dynamic structure evolution of catalysts plays a key role in revealing reaction mechanisms and designing efficient catalysts. In this work, PtCu/MgO catalysts, synthesized via the co-impregnation method, outperforms monometallic Pt/MgO and Cu/MgO. Utilizing quasi/in-situ characterization techniques, it is discovered that there is an obvious structural evolution over PtCu/MgO from Pt x Cu y O z oxide cluster to PtCu alloy with surface CuO x species under different redox and CO oxidation reaction conditions. The synergistic effect between PtCu alloy and CuO x species enables good CO oxidation activity through the regulation of CO adsorption and O 2 dissociation. At low temperatures, CO oxidation is predominantly catalyzed by surface CuO x species via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which CuO x can provide abundant active oxygen species. As the reaction temperature increases, both surface CuO x species and PtCu alloy collaborate to activate gaseous oxygen, facilitating CO oxidation mainly through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.</description>

                Rechargeable Zn-air batteries have received tremendous research interest in recent years, following the search for a safer and cheaper alternative to the lithium-ion battery, which has dominated the market of electric vehicles and consumer electronics. Zn-air batteries are a promising candidate due to their low cost, material abundance, high safety, and excellent theoretical energy density. However, Zn-air batteries suffer from zinc irreversibility due to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and passivation in aqueous electrolytes, as well as inefficient oxygen reduction and evolution processes, which severely limit their electrochemical performance and cyclic operations. To address these challenges, researchers have mainly focused on optimizing the zinc anode structure and composition and experimenting with more stable electrolyte alternatives. Substantial progress has also been made in the discovery and development of transition metals and carbon materials for bifunctional oxygen catalysts. This chapter will focus on the current barriers limiting the widespread adoption of rechargeable Zn-air batteries and highlight the main research strategies used to overcome these challenges. Although much remains to be done, Zn-air batteries are considered a promising candidate as the next leading rechargeable battery technology in the energy and electronic industries.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of Local Field Distortion-Induced Dual Electron-Trapping Centers for Efficient Photocatalytic Fuel Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124370</link>

                Active electron-trapping centers play significant roles in photocatalysis. Herein, we synergize local field distortion and defects in nanocrystals to produce dual electron-trapping centers and unravel the nature of aluminum doping in porous ZnO with tunable amounts of heteroatoms and oxygen vacancies. The introduced Al atoms in the structural domain induce local field distortion and trigger the movement of Zn2+ from a singlet low spin state to a stable triplet state, resulting in the generation of free carriers trapping centers and optimized electronic energy band structure. Dual active electron-trapping centers of heteroatoms and oxygen vacancies promote the Separation of photo-generated charge carriers and reduce the adsorption energies of H* species. Furthermore, the d-band center of Al-doped ZnO with oxygen vacancies shifts to a higher energy position, thus promoting the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen intermediates and exhibiting 4-fold the photocatalytic H2 efficiency of pristine ZnO. This study provides new insights into the rational design of highly efficient oxide-based photocatalysts toward sustainable solar fuel evolution.</description>

                Oxygen vacancies are prevalent in metal compounds and play a significant role in the activation of peroxomonosulfate (PMS) to mitigate water pollution. However, how to easily construct these oxygen vacancies and elucidate the mechanism of PMS activation by oxygen vacancies are still pending research and solution. This study presents the synthesis of a NiCoAl-LDH/Kaolin (NiCoAl-LDH/Kao) hybrid catalyst with quasi-2D layer structures morphology and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). We proposed an intriguing phase transformation from NiCo-carbonate hydroxide (CH) to NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH), and elucidated the morphological evolution mechanism from nanorod to nanosheet structures through alkaline etching. The NiCoAl-LDH/Kao-PMS system exhibited excellent rapid kinetics and removal efficiency of norfloxacin (NOR), degrading 92.0 % of NOR within 10 min and achieving a final degradation rate of 97.2 %, along with remarkable reusability performance of the NiCoAl-LDH/Kao catalyst. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species including sulfate radical (SO4&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (OH), superoxide anion (O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were found to be involved in the degradation process of NOR, and the degree of activity of the active groups from strong to weak is 1O2, SO4&#8722;, O2&#8722; and OH. The activation mechanism and conceivable degradation pathways of NOR were experimentally studied and proposed, and the toxicity of degradation intermediates was evaluated. The facile preparation method for NiCoAl-LDH/Kao nanocomposite holds potential for large-scale manufacturing in organic pollutant remediation, while also providing new insights on the indispensable role of OVs in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Emerging Magnesium-Air Battery Technology</title>

      <description>Ashok M. Shenoy, Akhila Das, S. K. Vineeth, Roshny Joy, Vijay Kumar Thakur, Neha Gupta, Praveen Raghavan, CRC Press eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400297784

                Metal air batteries such as Li-air (lithium), Zn-air (zinc), Mg-air (manganese), Na-air (sodium), and Al-air (aluminum) have recently gained tremendous research interest in terms of safety, life cycle, and energy density. Metal-air batteries are a family of electrochemical cells powered by oxidation and reduction reactions at metal anodes and air (oxygen) cathodes. They consist of metal (Li, Na, Mg, Al, Zn, Si, Fe, Sn, etc.) anode assembled in the cell, while an abundant renewable source of oxygen received from the atmospheric air acts as a cathode reactant. The working principle of a metal-air battery consists of a metal anode which gets oxidized to produce metal ions which move through an electrolyte medium towards the cathode and react with oxygen to form metal oxides. Among various metal-air batteries, magnesium-air batteries have proven to be one of the promising technologies with their high theoretical voltage (3.09 V), theoretical specific capacity (2,205 Ah kg&#8722;1), energy density (2,840 Wh kg&#8722;1), low cost, lightweight, environmental friendliness, and abundance in nature. These characteristics make magnesium-air battery technology a suitable power source for portable electronic devices and electric vehicle technology compared to other types of metal-air battery. However, the corrosion of the Mg anode caused by the reaction between Mg and the electrolyte and poor thermodynamics and kinetics owing to the MgO or MgO2 insulating film as the initial discharge product on air breathing, resulting in large polarization and a highly irreversible capacity, limit their commercial application. In this review, a detailed summary and discussion are provided regarding recent advancements in Mg and its alloys as anode materials with different fabrication techniques for the improvement in electrochemical performance. First, the alloying of Mg with transition metal elements is reviewed and shown to reduce corrosion and improve battery performance. Additionally, for the air cathode, extensive studies of electrocatalytic materials for oxygen reduction/evolution including Pt and Pt alloys, other noble metal catalysts, carbon-based materials, and transition metal oxides as catalysts are highlighted. For the electrolyte, the application of aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes in Mg-air batteries is discussed. Meanwhile, different compositions of the electrolyte and the addition of inhibitors to enhance electrochemical performance are also explored. The chapter also addresses the challenges and prospects reported in the development of rechargeable Mg-air batteries and bi-functional catalysts with reversible oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The close relationships between the Mg anode, electrolyte, and air cathode with electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction are also discussed. Continuous efforts have been put together by researchers to fabricate rechargeable Mg-air batteries having a wide range of applications.</description>

                Abstract A geologically rapid Neoproterozoic oxygenation event is commonly linked to the appearance of marine animal groups in the fossil record. However, there is still debate about what evidence from the sedimentary geochemical record&#8212;if any&#8212;provides strong support for a persistent shift in surface oxygen immediately preceding the rise of animals. We present statistical learning analyses of a large dataset of geochemical data and associated geological context from the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic sedimentary record and then use Earth system modelling to link trends in redox-sensitive trace metal and organic carbon concentrations to the oxygenation of Earth&#8217;s oceans and atmosphere. We do not find evidence for the wholesale oxygenation of Earth&#8217;s oceans in the late Neoproterozoic era. We do, however, reconstruct a moderate long-term increase in atmospheric oxygen and marine productivity. These changes to the Earth system would have increased dissolved oxygen and food supply in shallow-water habitats during the broad interval of geologic time in which the major animal groups first radiated. This approach provides some of the most direct evidence for potential physiological drivers of the Cambrian radiation, while highlighting the importance of later Palaeozoic oxygenation in the evolution of the modern Earth system.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1302/1/012034</link>

                Abstract We have previously found experimental evidence for several quantum phenomena in oxygen-ion implanted of hydrogenated graphite: ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagentism, triplet superconductivity, Andreev states, Little-Parks oscillations, Lamb shift, Casimir effect, colossal magnetoresistance, and topologically-protected flat-energy bands [1-6]. Triplet superconductivity results in the formation of Josephson junctions, thus with potential of being used for spintronics applications in the critical area of quantum computing. In this paper, we are showing new experimental evidence for the formation of two-dimensional (2D) spin waves in oxygen-ion enriched and in hydrogenated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The temperature evolution of the remanent magnetization M rem ( T ) data confirms the formation of spin waves that follow the 2D Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy. In addition, the step-like features also found in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity between insulating and metallic states suggest several outstanding possibilities, such as a structural transition, triplet superconductivity, and chiral properties.</description>

                Abstract Background Radiobiological effectiveness of radiation in cancer treatment can be studied at different scales (molecular till organ scale) and different time post irradiation. The production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species during water radiolysis is particularly relevant to understand the fundamental mechanisms playing a role in observed biological outcomes. The development and validation of Monte Carlo tools integrating the simulation of physical, physico&#8208;chemical and chemical stages after radiation is very important to maintain with experiments. Purpose Therefore, in this study, we propose to validate a new Geant4&#8208;DNA chemistry module through the simulation of water radiolysis and Fricke dosimetry experiments on a proton preclinical beam line. Material and methods In this study, we used the GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform (version 9.3) to simulate a 67.5 MeV proton beam produced with the ARRONAX isochronous cyclotron (IBA Cyclone 70XP) at conventional dose rate (0.2 Gy/s) to simulate the irradiation of ultra&#8208;pure liquid water samples and Fricke dosimeter. We compared the depth dose profile with measurements performed with a plane parallel Advanced PTW 34045 Markus ionization chamber. Then, a new Geant4&#8208;DNA chemistry application proposed from Geant4 version 11.2 has been used to assess the evolution of , , , , , , and reactive species along time until 1&#8208;h post&#8208;irradiation. In particular, the effect of oxygen and pH has been investigated through comparisons with experimental measurements of radiolytic yields for and Fe 3+ . Results GATE simulations reproduced, within 4%, the depth dose profile in liquid water. With Geant4&#8208;DNA, we were able to reproduce experimental radiolytic yields 1&#8208;h post&#8208;irradiation in aerated and deaerated conditions, showing the impact of small changes in oxygen concentrations on species evolution along time. For the Fricke dosimeter, simulated G(Fe 3+ ) is 15.97 &#177; 0.2 molecules/100 eV which is 11% higher than the measured value (14.4 &#177; 04 molecules/100 eV). Conclusions These results aim to be consolidated by new comparisons involving other radiolytic species, such as or to further study the mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect observed at ultra&#8208;high dose rates (UHDR).</description>

                Abstract Engineering oxygen vacancies (Vo) in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is considered as an effective strategy to improve the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) performance. However, the role of Vo and the metal sites for HzOR is still not fully understood. Herein, this study reports the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined bimetallic V O &#8208;rich benzene dicarboxylic acid&#8208;based MOF (NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC) as a model to clarify the intricate catalytic mechanism. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the Vo&#8208;rich environment favors the adsorption of OH &#8722; on the catalyst surface during the HzOR process, leading to the formation of Ni(OH) x active species. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Ir at metal nodes not only boosts the HzOR activity of the Ni sites by tuning their electronic structure but also serves as the active sites for hydrogen evolution. As a result, the two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer with NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC || NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC configuration achieved 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.046 V. This work provides new insights into oxygen vacancy defect engineering of MOFs and paves a solid step for low&#8208;energy consumption hydrogen production.</description>

                A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a new survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that orbit F stars above the Kraft break with different orbital alignments. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should lead to a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.</description>

      <title>High efficiency two-step electrocatalysis boosted by dual-motif bridge Co-S-Mo for Heterogeneous Electro-Fenton: Enhanced H2O2 production and fluoxetine elimination synergistic mechanism</title>

                Heterogeneous electro-Fenton process is widely recognized as intensive in-situ strategy with environmental compatibility. However, the simultaneous elevation of H2O2 production and exploitation efficiency during electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we propose an innovative dual-site catalyst (MoxCo9&#8722;xS8&#8722;yNy; MCN) with Mo active motifs for enhanced two-electron oxygen reduction reaction and Co active motifs for enhanced reactive oxygen species generation to promote H2O2 generation and fluoxetine (FLX) degradation. As determined by Mo scaling and application performance, the optimal MCN catalyst provided at least 20 % increase in contaminant elimination within 30 min, reduced the reaction potential by over 1.4 eV, and diminished environmental exposure to toxic products. The optimal MCN@CF cathode efficiently removed approximately 96.7 % FLX and 55.1 % total organic carbon at a pH of 3 within 35 min. The critical dual-motif bridge Co&#8211;S&#8211;Mo mediated by S could disrupt the synergistic *O and *OOH binding energies, significantly penetrating the catalysis barriers. This work unravels the structural optimization evolution of non-single-site catalysts, providing new solutions to the refractory issues of wastewater decontamination</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Model for IRAS 00500+6713: The Remnant of a Type Iax Supernova SN 1181 Hosting a Double Degenerate Merger Product WD J005311</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4d99</link>
      <description>Takatoshi Ko, Hiromasa Suzuki, Kazumi Kashiyama, Hiroyuki Uchida, Takaaki Tanaka, D. Tsuna, Kotaro Fujisawa, Aya Bamba, Toshikazu Shigeyama, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 969(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400366461

                Abstract IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a Type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multiwavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray Observatory to constrain the angular radius, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon-burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an ejecta kinetic energy of E ej = (0.77&#8211;1.1) &#215; 10 48 erg, an ejecta mass of M ej = 0.18&#8211;0.53 M &#8857; , if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow t w &#8819; 810 yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after 1990 CE. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin&#8211;Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen&#8211;neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen&#8211;neon and carbon&#8211;oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.</description>

      <title>Cytochrome oxidase requirements in Bordetella reveal insights into evolution towards life in the mammalian respiratory tract</title>

                Little is known about oxygen utilization during infection by bacterial respiratory pathogens. The classical Bordetella species, including B . pertussis , the causal agent of human whooping cough, and B . bronchiseptica , which infects nearly all mammals, are obligate aerobes that use only oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for electron transport-coupled oxidative phosphorylation. B . bronchiseptica , which occupies many niches, has eight distinct cytochrome oxidase-encoding loci, while B . pertussis , which evolved from a B . bronchiseptica -like ancestor but now survives exclusively in and between human respiratory tracts, has only three functional cytochrome oxidase-encoding loci: cydAB1 , ctaCDFGE1 , and cyoABCD1 . To test the hypothesis that the three cytochrome oxidases encoded within the B . pertussis genome represent the minimum number and class of cytochrome oxidase required for respiratory infection, we compared B . bronchiseptica strains lacking one or more of the eight possible cytochrome oxidases in vitro and in vivo . No individual cytochrome oxidase was required for growth in ambient air, and all three of the cytochrome oxidases conserved in B . pertussis were sufficient for growth in ambient air and low oxygen. Using a high-dose, large-volume persistence model and a low-dose, small-volume establishment of infection model, we found that B . bronchiseptica producing only the three B . pertussis -conserved cytochrome oxidases was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain for infection. We also determined that CyoABCD1 is sufficient to cause the same level of bacterial burden in mice as the wild-type strain and is thus the primary cytochrome oxidase required for murine infection, and that CydAB1 and CtaCDFGE1 fulfill auxiliary roles or are important for aspects of infection we have not assessed, such as transmission. Our results shed light on the environment at the surface of the ciliated epithelium, respiration requirements for bacteria that colonize the respiratory tract, and the evolution of virulence in bacterial pathogens.</description>

                In the study, a BNf/SiBN composite was fabricated through precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) method. The oxidation resistance of the composite was investigated at different oxidation temperatures, focusing on the micro-structure evolution, the phase composition and oxidation kinetics of bare fibers versus fibers protected by the matrix under various oxidation states. The result indicates that the BNf/SiBN composite remains stable at 1100&#176;C in air atmosphere, while the fibers protected by matrix maintain their complete structure even at 1500&#176;C. Furthermore, we elucidated the oxidation mechanism of SiBN matrix: SiBN matrix undergoes a prior oxidation stage and transforms into amorphous SiO2 and B2O3 at high temperatures to impede the oxygen attachment to fibers while preserving the integrity of internal structure. The emergence of ultra-high temperature resistant BNf/SiBN composite and along with the exploration of oxidation behavior has opened up new approach for advancing radome material development.</description>

      <title>Exospheric number densities retrieved from pickup ion ring distributions and their temporal variations responding to the dust storm and comet approach events at Mars</title>

                Pickup ions around Mars are originally produced from an exospheric neutral atmosphere and their measurements thus contain information on the exospheric neutral abundance. Here we present a method to retrieve exospheric number densities by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions of pickup ions measured by the SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition instrument on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft. We successfully retrieved exospheric oxygen density distributions at altitudes ranging from 1,000&amp;#8211;10,000 km around Mars (Masunaga et al., submitted). In this study, we also apply this method to analyze temporal variations of O exospheric densities. We particularly examined the case of the dust storm event in September 2016 during which thermospheric O and ionospheric O+ densities varied with a period of ~7-8 days (Masunaga et al., 2022, Hara et al., 2024) and the comet approach event in September 2014 during which the cometary atmosphere was transferred to the upper atmosphere of Mars (Crismani et al., 2015), finding that the Martian O exosphere likely responds to these drivers.</description>

                Deep Geological Repository (DGR) concept consist of storing radioactive waste in metal canisters, surrounded by compacted bentonite, and placed into a geological formation. Here, bentonite slurry microcosms with copper canister, inoculated with bacterial consortium and amended with acetate, lactate and sulfate were set up to investigate their geochemical evolution over a year under anoxic conditions. The impact of microbial communities on the corrosion of copper canister in an early-stage (45 days) was also assessed. The amended bacterial consortium and electron donors/acceptor accelerated the microbial activity, while bentonite heat-shocked process had a retarding effect. The microbial communities partially oxidize lactate to acetate which is subsequently consumed when the lactate is depleted. Early-stage microbial communities showed that the bacterial consortium reduced microbial diversity with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas dominating the community. However, sulfate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfocurvibacter, Anaerosolibacter, and Desulfosporosinus were enriched coupling oxidation of lactate/acetate with reduction of sulfates. The generated biogenic sulfides could mediate the conversion of copper oxides (possibly formed by trapped oxygen molecules on the bentonite or driven by the reduction of H</description>

                Abstract The spatial distribution profiles of particles in plasma sources push forward our understanding of plasma evolution and physicochemical processes occuring inside. Optical probe methods, such as laser-induced fluorescence, are advanced tools for spatially resolved plasma studies. In our work, we focused on investigation of distribution of neutral Ca and Fe atoms and CaO and FeO molecules in laser-induced plasma by means of laser-induced fluorescence. The development of excitation-emission schemes for Fe and FeO and the practical implementation of schemes for Ca and CaO allowed us to construct distribution maps of these species in laser plasma at 10 and 100 Torr pressures. Both atomic and molecular fluorescence was observed much further from the plasma formation point than the region of bright spontaneous atomic emission. Additionally, by comparing fluorescence intensity distributions with plasma imaging data, we explain the origin of some pecularities in observable plasma inhomogeneity.Distributions of Ca and CaO fluorescence intensity, as well the distribution of CaO/Ca intensity ratio, demostrate that the monoxide is distributed within the plume by the shock wave, but its concentration in the outer layers of plasma is influenced by recombination with atmospheric oxygen.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Consequences for the early evolution of Venus from new simulations of atmosphere erosion by impacts.</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-357</link>
      <description>C. Gillmann, Gregor Golabek, Jacob Kegerreis, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400291227

                Overview:We investigate how both late accretion and long-term evolution of Venus are affected by early volatile exchanges (outgassing, loss, delivery), using a set of numerical models. In particular, we incorporate new scaling laws of large-impact erosion proposed by Kegerreis et al. (2020), and results of new atmosphere erosion simulations, using the open-source SPH code SWIFT. We assess the conditions and evolutionary pathways consistent with present-day observations of Venus and how to discriminate between late accretion scenarios.Motivation:Due to both the striking similarities and the obvious differences between Earth and Venus, understanding Venus might hold keys to how planets become &amp;#8211; and cease to be &amp;#8211; habitable. The question of the origin and persistence of water in the atmosphere/surface of Venus is directly linked to that of habitability. The divergence between Earth and Venus has been suggested to possibly occur during the first few hundred million years due to interaction between the interior of the planet, its atmosphere and escape mechanisms (e.g. Hamano et al., 2013).General approach:Late accretion impacts constitute both the tail end of the main delivery of material to the planet and, set after the magma ocean phase, the &amp;#8220;initial conditions&amp;#8221; for the planet&amp;#8217;s long-term evolution. It could have important consequences for the distribution of elements, including volatiles. As no sample from Venus is available to constrain ancient history, we turn to modeling.The major constraints on Venus&amp;#8217; volatile evolution come from the present-day state of its atmosphere and its bulk composition. We use different sets of late accretion scenarios and plausible volatile exchange mechanisms (sources and sinks). We compare the atmosphere composition of corresponding evolution models to the present-day state of Venus&amp;#8217; atmosphere. Particularly, we investigate the loss mechanisms (sinks of volatiles) since they impose an upper limit on the amount of volatiles that can be injected into the system while still reaching present-day composition. Required initial conditions are also discussed.Models:Three separate models are used together to investigate volatile exchanges during and following late accretion. Late accretion scenarios are obtained from N-body simulations. They include sequences of collisions with rocky planets leading to scenarios producing Solar System-like configurations and are calibrated using Earth&amp;#8217;s late accretion mass based on the siderophile elements content of Earth&amp;#8217;s mantle (Rubie et al., 2016). We used previously generated scenarios (see Gillmann et al., 2020) to test the consequences of different mass-size distributions on volatile evolution. We include new high-resolution simulations from Joiret et al. (2024), which include tracking 1600 carbonaceous asteroids and 10,000 comets.Long-term evolution, interior evolution and atmosphere bulk composition are tracked using StagYY mantle dynamics models (see Gillmann et al., 2020). Important volatile-exchange mechanisms include volcanic outgassing, thermal and non-thermal atmosphere escape, and gas&amp;#8211;surface chemical reactions through oxidation of fresh lava. Coupling between the interior and the atmosphere is obtained by tracking surface temperature evolution using a radiative convective grey atmosphere model. Impacts affect the atmosphere in three different ways: (i) collisions cause the mantle and surface to melt, releasing volatiles, (ii) impactors deliver volatiles to the atmosphere as they are vaporized depending on their composition, (iii) the impact process leads to atmospheric erosion through a variety of mechanisms.Previous results were obtained using (i) a geometric approach, through the tangent plane model or (ii) using small-impactor results from the SOVA hydrocode (Shuvalov et al., 2014). Here we investigate the importance of constraining impact erosion of the atmosphere by comparing those previous results to more recent larger-impactor scaling laws obtained by Kegerreis et al. (2020). We further include ongoing simulations specifically developed for Venus&amp;#8217; atmosphere compositions and specific collisions defined by the late accretion impact scenarios described above.Results:The tiny amount of water in the present-day atmosphere of Venus limits water delivery from various mechanisms, even when considering water sinks throughout the history of the planet. The maximum amount of water that can be delivered, in turn, governs the estimated overall composition of late accretion impactors, imposing that the bulk of late accretion should be volatile poor.Non-thermal loss mechanisms can account for the loss in the range from 4 mbar up to a few bar of oxygen, depending on assumptions, and over &gt;4 Gyr. Trapping oxygen on the surface through oxidation of newly emplaced volcanic material through solid&amp;#8211;gas reactions appears inefficient (for a total loss similar to non-thermal escape), while recent oxidation of impact ejecta is a comparatively even smaller sink.On the first order, scaling laws extracted from simulations by Kegerreis et al. (2020) imply increased losses for high-energy collisions compared to previous estimates (Shuvalov et al., 2014), but use a different set of assumptions for the investigated atmospheres and consider larger bodies (figure 1). We investigate a series of possible parameterizations to reconcile those results.Figure 1: Loss rates for single impacts calculated from the two sets of simulations described in the text.Using lower atmosphere-erosion estimates leads to similar results regardless of the mass-size distribution of impactors, because the impact delivery of volatiles is the overall dominant effect. On the other hand, strong atmosphere erosion introduces divergences between late accretion scenarios depending on the distribution of impactor sizes, with smaller impactors having a net destructive effect while larger impactors contribute to increasing the atmosphere mass. This effect is not apparent in the water inventory but instead can be seen in the CO2 abundance evolution (figure 2). Therefore, we use CO2, N2 and Ar abundances to further discriminate between possible late accretion scenarios.Figure 2: Evolution of CO2 abundance in the atmosphere from simulations of two scenarios for late accretion. Scenario B includes a few large impactors, scenario D contains a larger number of smaller bodies.References:Kegerreis, J. A., et al. (2020), Astrophys. J. Let. 901.2.Hamano, K. et al.

      <title>Early transition metal oxides with oxygen vacancies as new thermodynamically stable materials for electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124368</link>

                Currently developed electrocatalysts are difficult to achieve high thermodynamic stability at each active site. Early transition metal oxides are promising electrocatalysts with excellent thermodynamic stability and water dissociation ability for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, they have not been developed as direct-electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, we introduce oxygen vacancies (Vo) by electrodeposition to convert early transition metal oxides (scandium oxide (Sc2O3), yttrium oxide (Y2O3), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2)) into active electrocatalysts. By optimizing the metal element species and Vo content, the screened Y2O2.13@GP shows the lowest overpotential (266 mV at 500 mA cm-2. Moreover, Y2O2.13@GP is able to operate stably for over 1000 h at a current density of 500 mA cm-2 under harsh industrial conditions of 6.0 M KOH and 80&#176;C without dissolution and reconstruction. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of Vo can enhance the conductivity of the catalyst, increase the exposure of the active sites, modulate the electronic structure of Y2O2.13@GP, and decrease the *H adsorption and water dissociation energy barriers.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Limitation Induced by Hydroxyl in Regulating Solvation Structure of Zn2+ and Overcoming Challenges with Hybrid Additives towards Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401073</link>

                In the field of electrolyte design for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), additives containing hydroxyl have been demonstrated to effectively modulate the solvation structure of Zn2+. However, reported studies typically focus solely on the effectiveness of hydroxyl while neglecting the issues that emerge during solvation structure regulation. The strong electron&#8208;attracting capability of Zn2+ attracts electrons from the oxygen in hydroxyl, thereby weakening the strength of hydroxyl, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also pronounced. This work innovatively reveals the limitation of hydroxyl&#8208;containing additives and proposes a synergistic regulation strategy based on hybrid additives. Arginine with a high isoelectric point is introduced into the electrolyte system containing hydroxyl additives. The protonation effect and electrostatic attraction of arginine enable it to absorb protons at the anode released by the weakened hydroxyl, thereby compensating for the limitation of hydroxyl additives. Under the synergistic action of hybrid additives, the Zn|Zn battery achieved stable deposition/stripping for over 1200 hours under 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the Zn|Cu battery cycled for over 570 hours with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.82%. This study presents a pioneering perspective for the further application of AZIBs.</description>

                Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a cause of bronchial dilatation, associated with rheumatoid lung is rare. This is why we report a case with the aim of discussing the clinical, diagnostic characteristics and therapeutic possibilities of ciliary pathology and showing the link between it and rheumatoid arthritis. Observation: This is a 40-year-old African patient, married without children, from a consanguineous couple, with a family history of a brother who died in adulthood in a picture of respiratory failure and productive cough. She presented with recurrent rhinorrhea since childhood and bronchorrhea in a picture of progressively worsening dyspnea and clubbing. During the evolution of the disease, inflammatory polyarthralgia was associated. The ultrastructural ciliary study by electron microscopy and the measurement of nasal nitrogen oxide are the confirmatory examinations of primary ciliary dyskinesia. They are not achievable in our practice. However, based on the history and clinical findings, the patient presented several elements in favor of this pathology. additional investigations, notably the rheumatoid factor and the chest CT scan, allowed us to suggest rheumatoid lung. Our therapeutic conduct was the administration of antibiotic therapy, oxygen therapy, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory and the practice of respiratory physiotherapy. Conclusion: Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with pulmonary involvement in rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing respiratory failure.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via
  accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf

                First, I demonstrate the possible formation channel for neutron stars (NSs) via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) composition white dwarfs (WDs) inside planetary nebulae (PNe; also so-called symbiotic nebulae). A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the roche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary phase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and it might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be ionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting WD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit mass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic nebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and the Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce another possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with newborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries.</description>

                Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are high-strength, high-modulus nanotubes with high thermal and oxidative stabilities. Two hybrid composites were prepared with satin weave CF and resole-type phenolic resin: one with surface layers of BNNTs and one with alternating interlayers of BNNTs. The samples were subjected to hot jet tests that simulate realistic high-pressure-temperature conditions to understand the behavior of BNNTs under high-pressure erosion. Adding BNNTs to CF/phenolic laminates enhanced the ablation resistance by reinforcing the char material and mitigated localized thermal damage. Hybrid laminates exhibited up to 14% lower weight loss, 55% increase in flexural modulus, higher thermal diffusivity, and improved char yield and microstructure compared to CF/phenolic samples. The surface layer hybrid had many surviving nanotubes reinforcing the char and crystalline oxide structures that could mitigate further oxygen diffusion. Various characterization methods were used to deduce possible mechanisms and their products, indicating that BNNTs could serve as growth templates for direct crystalline boron oxide formation. Overall, hybrid BNNT/CF/phenolic laminates displayed better ablation resistance and favorable microstructure evolution under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Siderite from the Tibetan Himalaya: Evidence for a low sulphate ocean during Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (Early Aptian)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/sed.13218</link>
      <description>Fancheng Meng, Zhong Han, Xiumian Hu, Hugh C. Jenkyns, Bolin Zhang, Yang Liu, Mingcai Hou, Sedimentology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400363472

                Abstract Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events were characterized by relatively low seawater sulphate concentrations ([]), which likely regulated the development and evolution of these major palaeoceanographic phenomena. However, there is little reliable sedimentary evidence for low [] in ancient marine waters and understanding of how such a seawater chemistry potentially impacted oceanic anoxic events is limited. This study presents an integrated sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical investigation of the mineral siderite hosted in dark grey shale and sideritic concretions of Early Aptian (coeval with Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a) from the Tibetan Himalaya. Siderite is present throughout the section and possesses similar morphological characteristics whether in dark grey shale or concretions. Siderite can be present as disseminated and rhombic crystals formed during early diagenesis, or minor spherical crystals formed during late diagenesis. The evidence from redox elements, middle rare&#8208;earth element bulge patterns and extremely low carbon&#8208;isotope values of the sideritic concretions indicates that the iron carbonate was formed in the Fe&#8208;reduction zones by the process of dissimilatory iron reduction. This process would have required conditions of low [], reducing environment, abundant iron and high alkalinity. Additionally, the coexistence of siderite and pyrite may indicate that dissimilatory iron reduction occurred close to the microbial sulphate reduction zone, with seawater [] hovering around the tipping point at which pyrite could form once seawater sulphate increased. Such an increase during Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a could have resulted from basalt&#8211;seawater interaction and associated enhanced continental weathering, and/or hydrothermal activity. This study's observations support the previous hypothesis that low [] for Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a was probably caused by massive gypsum burial in the proto&#8208;South Atlantic. Subsequently, enhanced sulphate input could have promoted microbial sulphate reduction and accompanying oxidation of organic matter, which likely further enhanced nutrient recycling, increased primary productivity and organic&#8208;carbon burial, leading to more oxygen consumption and expansion of oxygen minimum zones, as reconstructed for many oceanic anoxic events.</description>

                Abstract Ammonia fuel cells using carbon&#8208;neutral ammonia as fuel are regarded as a fast, furious, and flexible next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy conversion technology, but it is limited by the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Platinum can efficiently drive these three types of reactions, but its scale&#8208;up application is limited by its susceptibility to poisoning and high cost. In order to reduce the cost and alleviate poisoning, incorporating Pt with various metals proves to be an efficient and feasible strategy. Herein, PtFeCoNiIr/C trifunctional high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts are prepared with uniform mixing and ultra&#8208;small size of 2 &#177; 0.5 nm by Joule heating method. PtFeCoNiIr/C exhibits efficient performance in AOR ( J peak = 139.8 A g &#8722;1 PGM ), ORR ( E 1/2 = 0.87 V), and HER ( E 10 = 20.3 mV), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C, and no loss in HER performance at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 200 h. The almost unchanged E 1/2 in the anti&#8208;poisoning test indicates its promising application in real fuel cells powered by ammonia. This work opens up a new path for the development of multi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts and also makes a big leap toward the exploration of cost&#8208;effective device configurations for novel fuel cells.</description>

      <description>Yiwei Wang, Jie Zhang, Yu Wang, Jie Yu, Yijian Gao, Yang&#65533; Yang, Xiliang Li, Hongcheng Wang, Shengliang Li, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400248100

                Abstract Recent advances are achieved in the design and development of efficient organic photosensitizers (PSs), especially with fluorescence imaging navigation in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) region. However, there are simply a handful of NIR&#8208;II emissive organic PSs with efficient oxygen&#8208;independent capability due to the scarcity of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;responsive organic materials and targeted delivery. Herein, a NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emissive organic nanomedicine with biomimetic engineering for high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging and targeted multiple phototherapies of pancreatic tumors is reported. An A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type conjugated small&#8208;molecule TPC is designed and used to prepare water&#8208;dispersive nanoparticles, which demonstrated high efficiency for type I and type II photodynamic performances, good photothermal conversion of 57%, and bright NIR&#8208;II emission with a quantum yield of 9.8% under 808 nm light irradiation. With pancreatic cancer cell membrane camouflage, the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine achieved high&#8208;resolution and targeted bioimaging of whole&#8208;body blood vessels and tumors. Antitumor experiments demonstrated the high efficiency of the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine for pancreatic tumor elimination and good biosafety with 808 nm light irradiation. This work demonstrated a NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emissive versatile nanomedicine with enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting for high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and superior phototheranostics, providing a feasible idea for the evolution of targeted and high&#8208;performance theranostics.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Facile mass transport channel and accessible active sites are crucial for binder&#8208;free air electrode catalysts in rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Herein, a ZnS/NH 3 dual&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to prepare N/S&#8208;doped hierarchical porous bamboo carbon cloth (HP&#8208;NS&#8208;BCC) as binder&#8208;free air electrode catalyst for ZAB. BCC fabric with abundant micropores is firstly used as flexible carbon support to facilitate the heteroatom&#8208;doping and construct the hierarchical porous structure. ZnS nanospheres and NH 3 activization together facilitate the electronic modulation of carbon matrix by N/S&#8208;doping and optimize the macro/meso/micropores structure of carbon fibers. Benefiting from the highly&#8208;exposed N/S&#8208;induced sites with enhanced intrinsic activity, the optimized mass transport of biocarbon fibers, as well as the ultra&#8208;large specific surface area of 2436.1 m 2 &#183;g &#8211;1 , the resultant HP&#8208;NS&#8208;BCC catalyst exhibits improved kinetics for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. When applied to rechargeable aqueous ZABs, it achieves a significant peak power density of 249.1 mW&#183;cm &#8722;2 . As binder&#8208;free air electrode catalyst, the flexible ZAB also displays stable cycling over 500 cycles with a minimal voltage gap of 0.42 V, showcasing promising applications in flexible electronic devices.</description>

                Asgard archaea were pivotal in the origin of complex cellular life. Hodarchaeales (Asgardarchaeota class Heimdallarchaeia) were recently shown to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Clean Energy: Exploring FeVO4 Nanopebble Thin Film as an Outstanding Photoanode for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175391</link>
      <description>Sutripto Majumder, Abhijit A. Yadav, Levin Anbu Gomez, Y.M. Hunge, R. Srinivasan, Ki Hyeon Kim, Journal of alloys and compounds. 1002(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400314472

                This study presents a two-step synthesis approach utilizing the hydrothermal method and drop casting for the fabrication of FeVO4 (FVO) thin films onto FTO-coated glass substrates, employing sacrificial basic FeOOH (FOH) nanostructured thin films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of FVO nanopebble thin films. Morphological and elemental analyses revealed that the thickness and grain size of the FVO nanopebbles increased, reaching maximum values depending on the parent FOH nanostructures. Additionally, the optimized FVO nanopebbles exhibited a high content of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, a gradual increase in grain size and film thickness observed through the phenomenon of red-shifting in the optical band gap. The well-optimized FVO photoanode delivers the highest photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm&#8722;2 at an applied bias of 1.6 V (vs. RHE) under standard illumination, demonstrating exceptional stability under these conditions. Moreover, the photoanode exhibited exceptional injection efficiency of 96.7% compared to separation efficiency, as evidenced by photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) studies. Furthermore, the optimized photoelectrode exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 11.96 &#956;mol h&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 with a faradaic efficiency of 98.73% after one hour. Overall, the synthesized FVO nanopebble thin films shows promising potential for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.</description>

      <title>Functional stress responses in Glaucophyta: Evidence of ethylene and abscisic acid functions in &lt;i&gt;Cyanophora paradoxa&lt;/i&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jeu.13041</link>

                Abstract Glaucophytes, an enigmatic group of freshwater algae, occupy a pivotal position within the Archaeplastida, providing insights into the early evolutionary history of plastids and their host cells. These algae possess unique plastids, known as cyanelles that retain certain ancestral features, enabling a better understanding of the plastid transition from cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated the role of ethylene, a potent hormone used by land plants to coordinate stress responses, in the glaucophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa . We demonstrate that C. paradoxa produces gaseous ethylene when supplied with exogenous 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (ACC), the ethylene precursor in land plants. In addition, we show that cells produce ethylene natively in response to abiotic stress, and that another plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), interferes with ethylene synthesis from exogenously supplied ACC, while positively regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. ROS synthesis also occurred following abiotic stress and ACC treatment, possibly acting as a second messenger in stress responses. A physiological response of C. paradoxa to ACC treatment is growth inhibition. Using transcriptomics, we reveal that ACC treatment induces the upregulation of senescence&#8208;associated proteases, consistent with the observation of growth inhibition. This is the first report of hormone usage in a glaucophyte alga, extending our understanding of hormone&#8208;mediated stress response coordination into the Glaucophyta, with implications for the evolution of signaling modalities across Archaeplastida.</description>

      <title>Molecular Composition Evolution of Dissolved Organic Matter With Water Depth in Prydz Bay of East Antarctic: Carbon Export Implications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2023jc020571</link>
      <description>Bin Jiang, Jun Zhao, Dong Li, Liyang Zhan, Zengwen Gao, Hua Sun, Yuping Zhou, Jianming Pan, Yanqiang Sun, Journal of geophysical research. Oceans. 129(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400325823

                Abstract This study analyzes the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Prydz Bay by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry to probe the carbon sequestration capacity in the continental shelf system. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with water depth show that POC could be mainly decomposed into DOC and/or microbially degraded. Highly labile DOC is further degraded and remineralized by microorganisms within the upper 200 m, as evidenced by a downward enrichment of 13 C POC and increases in the average molecular weight, oxygen atom number (O) and double bond equivalents of DOM molecules, indicating that biodegradation is the main driver for particulate organic matter and DOM evolution with water depth. Semi&#8208;quantitative calculation demonstrates that &#8764;83% of POC was transformed to DOC as well as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and &#8764;30% of DOC further to DIC via microbial degradation within the upper 200 m in summer, resulting in a relatively low total organic carbon content in sediments of Prydz Bay. The newly transformed DIC and residue DOC can be preserved in the deep layer due to the formation of well stratified and stable water body in summer of Prydz Bay, ultimately entering the regional circulation system instead of being released back into the atmosphere. This could be one of the most important processes determining the atmosphere CO 2 uptake in the continental shelf system of Southern Ocean.</description>

      <title>Stable Isotopes of Landfast Sea Ice as a Record of La Grande River Under-Ice Plume Dispersal</title>

                Vertical profiles of salinity, and isotopic abundance ratios of hydrogen (&#948;2H ) and oxygen (@delta;18O) of 18 landfast ice cores, collected along the northeast coast of James Bay in March 2019, and one ice core collected in Belcher Islands, were used to obtain the winter timeseries of the spatiotemporal evolution of the under-ice plume of La Grande River (LGR), the dominant river in the area. Variability in the isotopic composition and salinity of the ice cores indicated changes to the water source composition at the ice-water interface when the ice layers formed. The increased presence of river water beneath the ice during January-March was marked by more negative isotopic ratios in the lower portion of the ice as river discharge was increased for hydroelectric production. River water was the source of ~43% of the ice in our ice core samples (n=320) with the interquartile range from 16% to 71%. The river water fractions incorporated into the ice indicate that LGR under-ice plume extended more than 75 km north and at least 30 km south of the river mouth for ~3 months. These findings correspond well with more challenging to obtain hydrographic observations. End-of-winter ice core sampling and analysis for isotopic abundance has potential as a tool to monitor dispersal of LGR discharge into the ice-covered coastal environment.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric compositional variations due to changes in mantle redox state&amp;amp;#160;</title>

                Rocky exoplanets' internal constitution is inferred indirectly through their atmospheric composition. Confidence in this inference necessitates coupling interior and atmospheric models. In the past, various atmospheric redistribution models were developed to determine the composition of exoplanetary atmospheres by varying element abundance, temperature and pressure (Woitke et al., 2021).However, these models neglect that present-day atmospheres were formed via volcanic degassing and, consequently, element abundances are limited by thermodynamic processes accompanying magma ascent and volatile release. Here we combine volcanic outgassing with an atmospheric chemistry model to simulate the evolution of C-H-O-N-S atmospheres in thermal equilibrium below 600 K. These volatiles can be stored in significant amounts in basaltic magmas and are the most commonly degassed species.Our model calculates possible atmospheric compositions by varying oxygen fugacity, melt and surface temperature, and volatile abundances, considering phase solubility, atmospheric processes (e.g., water condensation, hydrogen escape), the change in redox conditions caused by volcanic activity and the influence of existing atmospheres on further degassing.Our findings indicate that the prevailing atmospheric type below 600 K typically consists of CO2, N2, CH4, and, depending on temperature, H2O. Moreover, we illustrate that evolving atmospheric pressure and composition hinge significantly on the oxygen fugacity of the melt due to its impact on gas speciation and solubility. Reduced conditions yield atmospheres dominated by H2, NH3, CH4, and H2O, with exceedingly low atmospheric pressures. In contrast, oxidized conditions result in atmospheres comprising H2O, CO2, N2, and limited CH4, accompanied by high atmospheric pressures. Sulfur gases emerge predominantly at higher surface temperatures, manifesting as S2 or H2S under low mantle redox states and as SO2 under high mantle redox states. Notably, O2 is not generated abiotically, as sufficient carbon or hydrogen remains available to form H2O, CO, or CO2. Therefore, the formation of O2-dominated atmospheres would require excessive photodissociation of H2O or CO2 (Chang et al., 2021), a phenomenon likely common on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars.In addition to highlighting the indirect inference of rocky exoplanets' internal constitution through their atmospheric composition, we demonstrate that reduced magmas can oxidize via H2 and CO degassing, whereas oxidized magmas may undergo reduction through SO2 degassing. Furthermore, we conclude that the depth of the magma source region and the planetary size significantly influence atmospheric compositions due to the varying pressure dependence of degassed species' solubilities.</description>

      <title>Space Weathering Provides a Lower Limit on the Age of Saturn&amp;amp;#8217;s Rings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-562</link>

                Cassini observations of the micrometeoroid bombardment flux, ring mass and fractional pollution constrain the origin and history of Saturn&amp;#8217;s rings. In the simplest model, the age of the rings can be estimated by assuming the rings are a closed system with constant bombardment at the current rate. However, the rings are not a closed system and Cassini spectroscopy is consistent with space weathering of the cosmic dust polluting the rings. The remote sensing of the rings shows a red slope, with higher pollution at the shortest wavelengths, consistent with reddening due to space weathering of atmosphereless bodies. If processes at the time of the micrometeorite impacts or subsequent chemical and physical weathering can degrade the original pollutants, this means that laboratory spectra are not appropriate to determine the total extrinsic material that has struck the rings over their lifetime. Laboratory results for irradiation of icy outer solar system analogues indicate oxidation of organics and other pollutants over time. It is now generally agreed that the radiolysis of ice by energetic ions, electrons and solar UV photons produces the oxygen, ozone and peroxide seen at many icy satellites. The porosity of ice provides sufficient space for chemical reactions and mobility. The ring particle surfaces are in addition continually gardened by particle collisions and meteoritic impacts. Because of the loss processes, the current fractional pollution provides only a lower limit on the total integrated pollution flux, and thus a lower limit for the ring age. Rosetta data on the dust composition and surface reflectivity of Comet 67P provide our starting point for the composition of the bombarding material: Two independent analyses of Cassini UVIS spectra of Saturn&amp;#8217;s rings give fractional pollution in the outer B ring of 1.4 -3%. This provides a lower limit of 400 to 1600 million years for the most opaque parts of Saturn&amp;#8217;s B ring, depending on whether we use the maximum or minimum values for the bombardment rate reported by Cassini CDA. This result shows Saturn&amp;#8217;s rings may be as old as the planet Saturn itself, consistent with the estimates for the orbital evolution of ring moons Atlas and Epimetheus. The A and C rings may have formed more recently.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</description>

      <title>Challenges for Biomass Production in the Context of an Expansion of Biogas Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2478/picbe-2024-0097</link>

                Abstract The evolution of European states is based on access to information and knowledge, as well as innovative methods. Thus, the European states began to be more and more aware of the fact that protecting the environment and preventing the destruction of ecosystems are the key elements for progress. Current thinking is based on the continuous transformation of resources towards a finished product. Green energy has become a subject of major importance for all countries of the world and they are constantly trying to find new methods of its production, as well as the constant improvement of existing methods. Part of this market for energy produced from renewable resources is biogas. Biogas is produced by fermenting organic waste of vegetable or animal origin in the absence of oxygen. Biogas consists of methane gas and carbon dioxide. It can be used like any other fuel, having the same properties. Biogas can feed a mini cogeneration plant and simultaneously produce heat, hot water and electricity. This renewable energy is considered CO2-neutral and is an environmentally friendly alternative as a wide variety of residues can be transformed into biogas. For most countries with highly developed agriculture, this alternative can be an affordable option in terms of cost, efficiency and return on investment in the medium and long term. Speaking in the short term, this is difficult to evaluate, given all the factors involved in the process: from inputs to outputs. The perspectives in this sense seem to be quite advantageous if we look at the whole, namely, the decarbonization at the European level, but the legislative and logistical barriers make the situation more and more complex. The legislation regarding biogas production is adapted to the economic-social context of each country, but the entire logistics part is the responsibility of the producer. Here comes a major problem for many potential producers: "how, when and how much" must be done for a biogas station to operate constantly, without interruptions from a logistical point of view. This article aims to find solutions for the flow of raw materials for potential investors in this renewable energy segment to be as cost efficient as possible and at the same time to provide predictability in production. The methodology of this paper is based on a comparative analysis of studies and indicators. The literature in this field is becoming more and more extensive, as interest in this direction has been growing recently. This paper aims to analyze whether this direction towards biogas can be the optimal option for most European countries and the key to a sustainable energy source.</description>

                Abstract Lacustrine carbonates are a powerful archive of paleoenvironmental information but are susceptible to post&#8208;depositional alteration. Microbial metabolisms can drive such alteration by changing carbonate saturation in situ , thereby driving dissolution or precipitation. The net impact these microbial processes have on the primary &#948; 18 O, &#948; 13 C, and &#916; 47 values of lacustrine carbonate is not fully known. We studied the evolution of microbial community structure and the porewater and sediment geochemistry in the upper ~30 cm of sediment from two shoreline sites at Green Lake, Fayetteville, NY over 2 years of seasonal sampling. We linked seasonal and depth&#8208;based changes of porewater carbonate chemistry to microbial community composition, in situ carbon cycling (using &#948; 13 C values of carbonate, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and organic matter), and dominant allochems and facies. We interpret that microbial processes are a dominant control on carbon cycling within the sediment, affecting porewater DIC, aqueous carbon chemistry, and carbonate carbon and clumped isotope geochemistry. Across all seasons and sites, microbial organic matter remineralization lowers the &#948; 13 C of the porewater DIC. Elevated carbonate saturation states in the sediment porewaters ( &#937; &gt; 3) were attributed to microbes from groups capable of sulfate reduction, which were abundant in the sediment below 5 cm depth. The nearshore carbonate sediments at Green Lake are mainly composed of microbialite intraclasts/oncoids, charophytes, larger calcite crystals, and authigenic micrite&#8212;each with a different origin. Authigenic micrite is interpreted to have precipitated in situ from the supersaturated porewaters from microbial metabolism. The stable carbon isotope values (&#948; 13 C carb ) and clumped isotope values (&#916; 47 ) of bulk carbonate sediments from the same depth horizons and site varied depending on both the sampling season and the specific location within a site, indicating localized (&#956;m to mm) controls on carbon and clumped isotope values. Our results suggest that biological processes are a dominant control on carbon chemistry within the sedimentary subsurface of the shorelines of Green Lake, from actively forming microbialites to pore space organic matter remineralization and micrite authigenesis. A combination of biological activity, hydrologic balance, and allochem composition of the sediments set the stable carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotope signals preserved by the Green Lake carbonate sediments.</description>

      <title>White dwarf magnetospheres: Shielding volatile content of icy objects and implications for volatile pollution scarcity</title>

                . IntroductionBetween 25% and 50% of discovered white dwarfs have been found to contain heavy elements in their atmospheres (Koester et al, 2014). The sinking timescale of these heavy elements is relatively short, ranging from several days (for hydrogen-dominated white dwarfs) to millions of years (for helium-dominated white dwarfs). Therefore, these heavy elements are believed to originate from external sources other than the white dwarf core, due to the rapid sedimentation of heavy elements in white dwarfs. It is widely believed that the pollution results from the accretion of planetary material, with supportive evidence from observed dusty disks and transiting planets around white dwarfs. Therefore, the composition of pollutants in white dwarfs' atmospheres provides valuable information about the history of exoplanetary systems.Interestingly, the dominant elements found in accreted material on white dwarfs are rock-forming elements such as Mg, Ca, and Fe, with only a few white dwarfs being polluted by icy materials. This is inconsistent with the abundance of icy objects in exo-Kuiper belt or exo-Oort Cloud objects. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the scarcity of volatiles, including the primordially dry nature of the pollutants and observational bias due to asynchronous accretion. However, recent research shows that volatile vapor is necessary to the accretion disk to offer a drag to the debris, thereby facilitating the high accretion rates deduced from observation (Okuya et al, 2023). This implies that volatiles could exist with refractory elements in the disk, but be prevented from accretion onto the white dwarf by some unknown physical process.White dwarfs have been observed to have atmospheres polluted by heavy elements, which are thought to be accreted from planetary objects. Refractory pollution, such as silicate and iron elements, is more commonly observed than volatile pollution, which includes carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. It is currently unclear whether this scarcity of volatile pollution is due to the prevalence of dry pollutants, such as asteroids and rocky planets, or some unknown mechanism that shields the volatiles. In this work, We propose a mechanism to explain the lack of volatile pollution, which involves the shielding of volatiles by the magnetic field in the scenario of comet accretion.&amp;#160;2. Results&amp;#160;We find that the volatile content in the tidal fragments of comets can effectively sublimate during the process of orbital circularization. Following sublimation, the resulting volatile vapor may be shielded by the magnetosphere of white dwarfs, provided that the magnetosphere radius is greater than the corotation radius. The effectiveness of this volatile-shielded mechanism is determined by the extent of sublimation occurring outside the corotation radius. The main processes in this scenario are the following:(1) Tidal fragmentation and orbital circularization of comets. Comets are tidally disrupted within the tidal disruption radius. The generated fragments with a maximum size of ~ 200m migrate inward due to the Alfv&amp;#233;n wing drag and/or dust drag. In this work, we incorporate the Alfv&amp;#233;n wing drag to model the behavior of exo-Oort Cloud objects.(2) Volatile sublimation. After crossing the ice line, the interior of fragments gets heated up to the sublimation temperature of volatile materials, resulting in gas release from the surface. We adopt the physical properties of Solar System comets to study the thermal evolution and vapor evolution.&amp;#160;(3) Given that the corotation radius is smaller than the magnetosphere radius, the photoionized vapor is shielded from the corotation radius.Our findings reveal that objects with a size smaller than 500 m can experience complete volatile loss within 1 Myr. The effectiveness of the volatile-shielded mechanism hinges on whether the orbital circularization timescale is shorter or longer than the dry-out timescale. If it is longer, all the volatile content can be shielded from the corotation radius of the white dwarf. However, for a shorter circularization timescale, smaller icy objects can be completely dried out while larger objects retain some volatile content, leading to partial dryness and the presence of volatile material within the corotation radius. Consequently, the volatile-shielded mechanism cannot provide effective protection in such cases. A surface magnetic field weaker than 100~T could allow a sufficiently long circularization timescale for the volatile-shielded mechanism to work. As we mentioned, the prerequisite of this mechanism is that the magnetosphere radius is larger than the corotation radius. For example, for a white dwarf with a rotational period of two days, the magnetic field must be larger than 1~T.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;By introducing the magnetic shielding of volatile, we extrapolated a correlation between a white dwarf's magnetic field, spin period,&amp;#160; and the composition of the pollutants. We applied our model to nine white dwarfs with known magnetic fields, rotational periods, and atmosphere compositions, and observed that the polluted white dwarf G29-38 (WD2326+049) is volatile shielded in our model, potentially explaining the excess of volatile elements such as C and S in the disk relative to the white dwarf atmosphere. The other eight white dwarfs under investigation {{exhibit receptivity to volatiles.}} This is consistent with the presence of hydrogen in the four investigated DBA white dwarfs.&amp;#160;However, the lack of hydrogen in the four examined DB white dwarfs cannot be explained by our shielding mechanism and may be attributed to the absence of planetary systems or other unknown mechanisms. We suggest that future observations of white dwarfs with different magnetic fields and rotational periods will provide more insights into the efficiency of the volatile-shielded mechanism. Additionally, our model is highly sensitive to the orbital evolution and material properties of exocomets, and a comparison between observations and our model may lead to valuable constraints on the properties and origins of pollutants.ReferencesKoester, D., G&amp;#228;nsicke, B.

                In terrestrial, carbon-based biochemistry, heteroelements such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus play crucial roles as they introduce specific chemical functionalities in organic (hydrocarbon-based) molecules. The debate about the origin and evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere requires a detailed understanding of (1) where and how organic chemical complexity emerges in space and (2) what exogenous materials may have been delivered to the early Earth through impacts, see, e.g., Rubin et al. (2019). Comet studies enable investigation of both aspects as these small bodies possess an organic-rich material record dating back to the earliest history of our Solar System and were an exogeneous contributor of volatile species to Earth (Marty et al. 2017).ESA&amp;#8217;s Rosetta mission visited and accompanied comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P) for two years and during a large part of the comet&amp;#8217;s orbit around the Sun. Rosetta analyzed the comet&amp;#8217;s chemical composition in unprecedented detail. A key instrument was the high-resolution Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) &amp;#8211; part of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA; Balsiger et al. 2007). It unveiled a surprising organic chemical complexity: Relying on reference spectra, either calibrated or from the database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, H&amp;#228;nni et al. (2022) showed how the extremely complex cometary mass spectrum is fully deconvolved. After detailed investigation of the pure hydrocarbon species (H&amp;#228;nni et al. 2022) and the O-bearing organic molecules (H&amp;#228;nni et al. 2023), our current work focuses on the N-bearing compounds. The heteroelement N is common in biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleobases and responsible for their characteristic biochemical functionality. To date, only a few N-bearing complex organic molecules have been identified in comets, one of them being the simplest amino acid glycine (C2H5NO2), which was reported by Altwegg et al. (2016) after a targeted search. Here, we present a non-targeted, full analysis of the N- and NO-bearing complex organics and compare them to N-bearing molecules in meteorites, other comets, and the interstellar medium.&amp;#160;Rubin et al.

      <title>Evolution of Mercury's Sulfides in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-610</link>
      <description>Noah J&#228;ggi, C. Morel, A. Mutzke, C. A. Dukes, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400290674

                Mercury&amp;#8217;s exosphere is sourced from meteoritic and solar radiation interaction with the surface and is therefore a reflection of the soil composition. Curiously, sulfur has not been detected in the exosphere unlike magnesium and calcium [1]. This is despite a strong correlation between sulfur and calcium across the surface [2,3], and with magnesium in the Intercrater Plains and Heavily Cratered Terrain as detected by the X-ray spectrometer (XRS) onboard MESSENGER [4].Defect-mediated diffusion of sulfur in troilite (FeS) and pentlandite [(Fe,Ni)9S8] has been proposed to explain observational and experimental results where a sulfur-depleted layer is capped by a Fe surface layer [5-7]. Unlike the Moon, where FeS grains are known to occur in the regolith [8], Mercury is relatively poor in iron. If the diffusion parameter found for FeS [6] were to be applied to other sulfides, the amount of available sulfur would be reduced by about an order of magnitude [9]. The presence of a metal layer formed by space weathering processes could explain why sulfur was detected by spectrometers observing the surface onboard MESSENGER [2,3,4] but not ejected at rates necessary for exospheric. In J&amp;#228;ggi et al. 2024 it was assumed that all sulfides express a similar sulfur diffusion due to a lack of experimental data. Therefore, in this study, we have used X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to measure surface sulfur concentrations for oldhamite (CaS) and niningerite (MgS) as a function of incident ion fluence.Sulfide pellets were pressed from powder samples (&amp;#8804;10&amp;#160;&amp;#181;m) in a nitrogen-purged glove tent and transferred to the XPS instrument under low vacuum to prevent atmospheric contamination. These experiments were then simulated using the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) Monte Carlo code SDTrimSP. In Figure 1 we show the simulated evolution of the surface composition of a CaS pressed-powder pellet, irradiated with 1 keV H+, along with the XPS data. Atmospheric contamination due to oxygen and adventitious carbon leads to an initial surface that is non-stoichiometric. The remnant 15 at% of surface oxygen at fluences &amp;#8805; 1019 ions/cm2 is interpreted to be a result of the rough surface of the pressed powder sample shadowing oxidized inter-granular spaces.Figure 1: Irradiation of oldhamite (CaS) powder pellet with ~3 x 1013 H+/s at 1 keV.&amp;#160; XPS data (dots) and its error, the BCA results without (line) and with diffusion (dashed line; diffusion rate from Ref. 6).Interestingly, our measurements indicate that defect-mediated sulfur diffusion does not occur in CaS as it does in FeS; instead, a near stoichiometric Ca:S ratio is seen at the surface, after removal of adventitious carbon and the oxidized surface. We will present data for MgS and CaS, separately irradiated by H+ and He+, and make informed predictions on the behavior of Mercury&amp;#8217;s sulfides based on our observations and diffusion simulations. In addition to compositional data, we will present changes in morphology (e.g., Fig. 2) and mid infrared reflectivity. For now, we can conclude that the surface depletion of sulfur observed when irradiating iron sulfides is not occurring in CaS. Consequently, a metal surface-layer does not form on CaS and the sputtering of sulfur is not reduced. The non-detection of sulfur in Mercury&amp;#8217;s exosphere is, if tied to low supply of sulfur, likely the result of other processes.Figure 2: SEM image of pressed oldhamite powder before and after irradiation.[1] Grava, C., et al.

      <title>Mineralogy of the mantles in sub- Earths and exo- Mercuries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-1011</link>
      <description>Camilla Cioria, G. Mitri, J. A. D. Connolly, Jean&#8208;Philippe Perrillat, Fabrizio Saracino, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400289459

                The mantle mineralogy of large exoplanets (e.g. super- Earths, planetary bodies having masses between 1-10 ME) has been widely investigated (Duffy et al., 2015).However, the minerals constituting the mantle of Mercury-sized objects (here referred to as exo-Mercuries) and sub-Earths (planetary bodies having masses ranging from 1 MM &lt; 1ME, respectively 1 Mercury-mass and 1 Earth-mass), orbiting closer to their stars, are still underexplored. &amp;#160;This modeling work has focused on describing stable mineral associations in those mantles equilibrated under low values of oxygen fugacity (fO2). Such reducing conditions are not uncommon in stellar systems, as evidenced by various materials in the solar system, ranging from undifferentiated ones (carbonaceous chondrites belonging to the CH and CB groups) to enstatite chondrites, to already differentiated materials like aubrites, and even entire planets like Mercury.Assuming Mercury as a proxy, we employed the open-source software Perple_X (Connolly, 1990) to characterize the mineral assemblages forming the mantle of these reduced planetary bodies.The thermodynamic approach here adopted offers the advantage of allowing the investigation of those planetary interiors otherwise not explorable. Moreover, the employed thermodynamic inputs were extrapolated from known precursor materials, which share several properties with exoplanets under examination. This methodology has already been discussed in literature (N&amp;#233;ri et al., 2020; Cioria and Mitri, 2022), ensuring the validity of this approach. Bulk silicate compositions of aubrite and CH, CB, EN chondrites, have been used as thermodynamic inputs in our simulations. Calculations were conducted within the pressure and temperature ranges suggested for the mantle of Mercury: 1200 K -1700 K and 3 GPa -5 GPa (Tosi et al., 2013).&amp;#160;We found that orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, and accessory minerals constitute the mantles of Mercury and reduced exoplanets. These results indicate that the initial bulk compositions have a first-order constraint on the resulting mantle mineralogy; more specifically, the initial abundance of SiO2 determines the chemical equilibrium shift between pyroxene and olivine, respectively constituting the dominant phases at high and low silica content. The predicted mantle mineralogy, dominated by pyroxenes, is consistent with that outlined by Putirka and Rarick, (2019) and Putirka and Xu, (2021).The differences with Earth&amp;#8217;s mantle mineralogy are significant, necessitating a new and more appropriate classification of these rocks, as already suggested in Putirka and Rarick, (2019).This outcome holds significant implications for the thermochemical evolution and geodynamics of reduced mantles, also exerting a&amp;#160; substantial influence on the properties of the related&amp;#160; crusts and cores.Future investigations on Mercury, conducted by the ESA BepiColombo mission, could shed new light on the possible mineralogy of its mantle, helping to further detail the minerals stable in those exoplanets formed in similar geochemical contexts.AcknowledgmentsG.M. and C.C. acknowledge support from the Italian Space Agency (2017-40-H.1-2020).References Cioria, C., &amp;amp; Mitri, G.

      <title>Probing Superhabitable Worlds: Modeling Exoplanetary Atmospheres for simulated JWST Observations</title>

                In our search for life in the Universe, there may be planetary bodies that are more conducive to life than Earth. Even Earth's habitability has varied enormously throughout the eons. We call worlds that are more habitable than Earth today &amp;#8216;superhabitable&amp;#8217;. In the pursuit of superhabitable worlds, K dwarf stars emerge as promising candidates due to their stable luminosity evolution, offering prolonged stability within the habitable zone conducive to life's emergence and sustainability (Arney 2019; Heller and Armstrong 2014; Schulze-Makuch, Heller, and Guinan 2020). A planet with up to 2 times Earth&amp;#8217;s mass and around 25% larger than Earth orbiting such a K dwarf star could qualify as superhabitable. Such dimensions would result in surface pressures of roughly 1.2 bar, exceeding Earth's current pressure by 20%. This configuration would offer expanded living space and enable the retention of a denser atmosphere, providing the necessary mass and energy to support a more extensive biosphere. Moreover, the denser atmosphere would enhance detectability through remote observations. A superhabitable planet would also likely exhibit a slightly warmer climate than present-day Earth, with temperatures elevated by approximately 5 degrees Celsius. This modest increase aligns with historical trends, as biodiversity flourished during warmer epochs, with tropical zones hosting the majority of Earth's current biodiversity (Vilovi&amp;#263;, Schulze-Makuch, and Heller 2023). In terms of atmospheric compositions, such planets would exhibit heightened oxygen concentrations which contribute to expanded metabolic networks and support larger body sizes among organisms.&amp;#160;In our most recent study, we tested the effects of simulated K-dwarf radiation on the phototrophic organisms garden cress and cyanobacteria using an LED stellar simulator. We found that both organisms are capable of growing under this modified radiation environment, with cyanobacteria exhibiting significantly better responses to K dwarf compared to solar radiation (Vilovi&amp;#263; et al. 2024). Expanding upon these laboratory results, we now turn to theoretical models to assess the detectability of superhabitability with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We combine the results of the 1D coupled climate-photochemistry model Atmos for modeling superhabitable atmospheres (Kopparapu et al. 2013) as well as the POSEIDON forward modeling code to calculate synthetic planetary spectra (MacDonald and Madhusudhan 2017; MacDonald 2023), with the PandExo tool for simulating observations of transiting exoplanets with the JWST (Batalha et al. 2017). Preliminary results indicate that superhabitable conditions positively impact the observability of key spectral features, including the oxygen features at 0.69, 0.77 and 1.24 micrometers, as well as the carbon dioxide feature at 4.3 micrometers and the ozone feature at 9.6 micrometers. Furthermore, these spectral features may require fewer transits for detection with the JWST compared to a modern Earth counterpart. This underscores the importance of prioritizing exoplanets orbiting K dwarf stars within the center of their habitable zones in our search for life outside of the Solar System using state of the art instrumentation.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;ReferencesArney, Giada N. 2019. &amp;#8220;The K Dwarf Advantage for Biosignatures on Directly Imaged Exoplanets.&amp;#8221; The Astrophysical Journal Letters 873 (1): L7.Batalha, Natasha E., Avi Mandell, Klaus Pontoppidan, Kevin B.

                &amp;#160;Introduction: The JAXA Martian Moon eXploration mission will be launched in 2026 toward the Martian moon Phobos. The MMX infrared spectrometer (MIRS, [1]) will observe Phobos within the 0.9 to 3.6 &amp;#181;m range to detect potential signatures of organics and hydrated minerals. The existence of such signatures may shed light on the unknown origin of Phobos. In close collaboration with CNES and other French and Japanese laboratories, the LESIA &amp;#8211; Paris Observatory is responsible for the development of the MIRS instrument. Along with the instrument development, in support of future MIRS observations, we already performed laboratory experiments to search for a Phobos spectroscopic simulant [2,3,4] and study the effects of observation geometry [3,4,5]. It is well known that surface porosity is an extremely important parameter of small bodies' surfaces, influencing their physical, spectroscopic, and photometric properties. However, the effects of porosity remain ambiguously understood with studies giving conflicting results (e.g., [6,7,8]). A high porosity is suggested for Phobos, in particular, because of the very low thermal inertia associated with the presence of a possible 10 &amp;#181;m plateau in the MIR spectra of Phobos [9,10]. Moreover, as an airless body, Phobos also undergoes significant space weathering from solar wind, galactic cosmic rays, micrometeorites, and sputtering of heavy ions from the Martian atmosphere [11,12] due to its proximity to Mars, with the solar wind being likely the most influential process for Phobos surface (Fig. 1).In this work, we investigate the spectroscopic and photometric modification of Phobos regolith simulants induced by these two parameters: (1) porosity and (2) solar wind space-weathering.Figure 1:&amp;#160;Flux density at Phobos' surface of oxygen ions produced in the upper layer of the Martian atmosphere, and of hydrogen and oxygen ions from the solar wind.&amp;#160;Method:To accurately represent the surface of Phobos, several samples were selected, including two Phobos simulants [4,5], olivine, phyllosilicate (saponite), coals (anthracite, DECS-19 from the Penn State Coal Bank), and iron sulfide (troilite). In particular, hydrated minerals and organics are important for Phobos, as the detection of these components could provide pivotal clues to decipher the origins of Phobos.Figure 2:&amp;#160;Evolution of a Phobos simulant during the sublimation experiment. The blue spectrum represents the initial spectrum and the red spectrum shows the final spectrum when the water ice is fully sublimated. One spectrum is taken every hour.&amp;#160;For the porosity effect study, porous Phobos simulants were created by sublimation of water ice mixed with grains (Fig. 2) of the Phobos simulants [14], resulting in a highly porous sublimation residue, as visible in Fig. 3. This study investigated the spectro-photometric variations induced by porosity using the SHADOWS spectro-goniometer [15] at IPAG (France) with spectroscopic measurements ranging from 0.4 to 3.6 &amp;#181;m. Additionally, mid-infrared (MIR) reflectance spectra (1.25 &amp;#8211; 18 &amp;#181;m) were also obtained using the FTIR Bruker Vertex70v spectrometer. Our analysis in the MIR focuses on the modifications in shape and positional shifts of three key features for mineralogical interpretation: the Christiansen feature, the Restrahlen band, and the transparency feature.For the space-weathering effect, we will present preliminary results on the irradiation of samples with 140 keV He and Ar ions with the ARIBE beamline at GANIL (France) to reproduce the effects of solar wind that reach and alter the Phobos&amp;#8217; surface. The use of two ions allows to explore different regimes of deposited dose.Figure 3: SEM image of a porous sublimation residue of the UTPS-TB Phobos simulant. &amp;#160;Results:Our results on porosity indicate that the spectrum samples tend to exhibit a bluing of its spectral slope in the visible and near-infrared after increasing porosity (Fig. 4). This spectral slope difference between a compact and porous sample may explain the difference between the blue and red unit on Phobos. In the mid-infrared range, the Christiansen feature is modified and the emissivity peak is larger for porous samples, leading to the formation of a 10 &amp;#181;m-plateau in the spectra of porous samples (Fig. 4). The study of the photometric properties reveals that porous samples exhibit a reduced single-scattering albedo and a slightly broader lobe that predominantly back-scattered, as for the compact samples, but with a higher contribution of forward scattering. The derivation of the Hapke parameters shows an increase in roughness for the porous sample, as expected by the macro-roughness visible on optical microscope images; but no modification of the opposition effect in contrast to what might have been expected with the modification of the surface texture. Additionally, phase reddening varies between compact and porous samples, suggesting it as an additional valuable observable for MIRS.Figure 4: VNIR and MIR spectra of UTPS and OPPS before and after the sublimation experiment.&amp;#160;Conclusion: This study gives novel and unique insights into the spectroscopic effects of porosity and solar wind on the regolith layer of Phobos, in the context of the upcoming JAXA/MMX mission, with interesting applications to the surfaces of other airless bodies. We will present, for the first time, the impacts of ion irradiation on the photometric properties of Phobos&amp;#8217; regolith, improving our understanding of space weathering processes.&amp;#160;Acknowledgments: The authors acknowledge the Centre National d&amp;#8217;Etudes Spatiales (CNES) for the continuous support.&amp;#160;References: [1] Barucci et al.

      <title>Long-Term Planning strategy evolution for Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-297</link>
      <description>L. Riu, Bernhard Geiger, Juan Jos&#233; Garc&#237;a Beteta, B. Grieger, L. Riu, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400291713

                ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) was launched by the European Space Agency in March 2016 and started operating around Mars in April 2018 after the nominal science orbit was reached. Four instruments are mounted on the spacecraft: The Atmospheric Chemistry Suite (ACS), the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS), the Fine Resolution Epithermal Neutron Detector (FREND), and the Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery (NOMAD) instrument. The ACS and NOMAD instruments are dedicated to studies of the Martian atmosphere. The CaSSIS visible camera is equipped with a rotation mechanism allowing to acquire images of the same target with different viewing angle in the same overflight pass, enabling stereo images. Specific regions can be targeted by rolling the spacecraft in across-track direction. The FREND instrument requires nadir or near-nadir pointing during a large fraction of time to map the hydrogen abundance in the sub-surface.&amp;#160;The Science Operations Centre (SOC) based at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC, Spain) is responsible for the implementation of science operation timelines, considering the instrument team requests and the mission's science priorities, while at the same time complying with spacecraft and operational constraints (B. Geiger et al., 2018, M. Ashman et al., 2018). We describe here the overall planning strategy for TGO and its evolution. The planning is divided into specific segments: long, medium, and short term, corresponding to 6-months, 4-weeks and 1-week planning periods. The strategy is set for a long-term planning period (LTP) and revised if/when necessary. For each 6-month or LTP period, the planning is such that solar occultations opportunities are computed for the overall period. On average, since the beginning of the mission, we find that a LTP period comprises ~3500 occultations opportunities amongst which ~60% are eventually scheduled. The scheduled occultation pointings are partitioned between the ACS and NOMAD instrument. Additionally, it is possible to indicate in the schedule that ACS can ride-along a percentage of prime occultations allocated to NOMAD.&amp;#160;Depending on the location at the surface and/or the Solar Longitude (Ls, i.e., the local season) the occultations can be considered with higher priority. Starting from MTP012 (in February 2019), occultations covering the equatorial regions were considered with highest priority. Thus, no other type of observations can be implemented during periods of equatorial occultations. Moreover, based on instrument teams requests a list of regions of interest (ROI) is also used to flag amongst the occultations opportunities the ones with high priority. This list was started during MTP020 in October 2019 and the last addition to the list is dated to April 2024. We do not exclude that this list will evolve in the future to respond to scientific requirements/discoveries. To this day, 7 ROIs are defined: Gale Crater, Jezero Crater, Green Valley, Utopia Planitia, Elysium Planitia, Alba Mons and Arsia Mons (for the detection of Elongated Clouds). Nominally, the instrument allocation for &amp;#8220;highly valuable occultations&amp;#8221; on ROIs is 50/50 between the ACS and NOMAD instruments while trying to get similar spatial coverage on each region for both instruments.&amp;#160;The CaSSIS instrument team provides a list of images (Nadir pointing or targeted pointing, the latter resulting in off-nadir angle) at Medium Term planning (MTP). On average ~2500 nadir images and ~1400 targeted images are acquired per LTP-period. Targeted images are important to fill gaps on the surface and/or to point to locations that cannot be reached while observing in Nadir mode. Although this puts constraints on the space-craft operations, the off-nadir angle allowed for these observations have recently been increased from 5 to 7 degrees to allow for better access to regions that can rarely be observed.At MTP-level, other types of observations can be implemented. Mostly, observations that are not part of the standard repetitive pointing timeline and that result in large off-nadir angle. These specific observations, labelled as &amp;#8220;Special Pointings&amp;#8221;, are limited in number to 5 per STP (i.e., per week) due to their operational constraints. They correspond to calibration measurements, Phobos or Deimos observations and limb observations. Special pointing calibrations measurements were included in the planning strategy since the beginning of the mission with an allocation of 1 special pointing per STP. This number has increased with time (5 to this day) thanks to the scientific benefit of these pointings. The first limb measurement occurred in MTP014, in April 2019; the first Phobos measurement occurred in MTP045, in September 2021 and the first Deimos measurement took place in MTP049, in December 2021. The limb measurements are usually used by the NOMAD instrument to detect and characterise&amp;#160;airglow&amp;#160;(day- or night- glow) and&amp;#160;auroras (G&amp;#233;rard et al., 2020a,b; Soret et al., 2022; Soret et al., 2023; G&amp;#233;rard et al., 2023). Recently, experimental measurements for limb observations with CaSSIS were also carried out. These CaSSIS observations are promising (Thomas et al., 2024) and are implemented as special pointings on the basis of ~1 per MTP. Based on instrument team requests, moon observations for ACS have stopped in May 2022.Reference: B.

                ICMC LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 2023 David Evans Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and Advanced Cryogenic Materials Ltd. United Kingdom Prof. Xavier Obradors Institut de Ci&#232;ncia de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC) and Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (RACAB) Spain ICMC has presented its Award for Lifetime Achievement, typically biannually, at the CEC/ICMC conference since its 30 th anniversary conference in Keystone in 2005 to an individual to &#8220;recognize a lifetime&#8217;s achievement in advancing the knowledge of cryogenic materials&#8221;. The eleventh and twelfth recipients of the ICMC Lifetime Achievement Award are David Evans and Xavier Obradors, who follow Edward W. Collings in 2005, David C. Larbalestier in 2007, Kyoji Tachikawa in 2009, Ren&#233; Fl&#252;kiger in 2011, Harold Weber in 2013, Herbert Freyhardt in 2015, Kozo Osamura in 2017, Archie Campbell in 2018, Teruo Matsushita in 2019, and Shi Xue Dou in 2021. DAVID EVANS Dave Evans has been evaluating, developing, and deploying cryogenic materials beginning in 1967 at the Rutherford Appleton National Laboratory after he earned a degree in chemistry at the University of North London. He has continued actively working on cryogenic materials after retiring in 2001 through his consulting company Advanced Cryogenic Materials Ltd. He is known internationally for developing, characterizing, and using non-metallic materials and structures for cryogenic applications. He worked on projects around the world (European Union, United States, Japan, Russia, Korea, and China) and established a technical reputation for the selection, design, testing, and low-temperature employment of epoxy resins, glass-reinforced/epoxy composite laminates, radiation-resistant composite insulation, and vacuum-pressure resin impregnation of large-scale magnets. Evans was one of the pioneers in developing and characterizing low-temperature epoxy resin systems for use in resin impregnation and electrical insulation for high-energy physics magnets. One aspect of his knowledge was of the low-temperature radiation resistance of organic materials, from his research on the effects that thermal and fast neutrons have on the mechanical properties, swelling, gas emission, and permeability of the organic epoxies. These radiation studies were done at room and cryogenic temperatures with different dosages to understand the effects that the cross-linking in the epoxy polymer chains had on gas evolution and fracture (chain scission). The knowledge he developed about epoxy systems directly contributed to building successful magnets around the world, including at DESY, CERN, and ITER. For example, Evans was part of a team (including Richard Reed, Paul Fabian, and Paul Clark) that developed and characterized a low viscosity epoxy system for large superconducting magnets that was used for the ITER central solenoid (CS). They developed a vacuum polymer impregnation (VPI) system to outgas the magnet and resin components, and then inject, gel, and cure the resin in the ITER CS Model Coil (MC) and CS Modules with virtually no defects. At the time, the CS MC established a world record for injecting more than 300 gallons of resin in the coil. Over the years Evans amassed an encyclopedic understanding of epoxy systems that he generously shared with colleagues. This included such things as expiration of the epoxy components, acceptable tolerances on the mixes, temperatures, and pressures, insulation drying in the mold, and acceptable outgassing rates in the insulation before transferring the resin into the mold. This information is critical for successful applications. A colleague described his kindness, humbleness, generosity and willingness to share his immense accumulated knowledge about composite behavior at cryogenic conditions as a precious gift for his colleagues and for many industries around the world. Citation for Evans&#8216;s award : In recognition of his domestic and international contributions developing, characterizing, and using non-metallic materials and structures for a wide variety of cryogenic applications. XAVIER OBRADORS Xavier Obradors earned a PhD in Physics from the University of Barcelona in 1982 and has been active in superconductivity since high-temperature superconductors were discovered. He is a Research Professor, Director of the the Institut de Ci&#232;ncia de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC), and a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (RACAB) Spain. Early on Obradors investigated high-temperature superconductors growing single domain YBCO crystals using the Bridgman and the top-seeded pellet techniques. He focused on understanding vortex pinning with respect to the defect structure in these materials and also worked on their applications for fault current limiters, magnetic levitation, and motor applications. Obradors shifted his focus to REBCO coated conductors (CC) made by the chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique. His group at ICMAB-CSIC has focused on developing this inexpensive technique using innovative approaches to study all aspects related to CSD. These include establishing CSD routes to fabricate all the buffer layers and the REBCO layer, deconvoluting the epitaxial REBCO growth mechanism, generating flux pinning nanocomposites using spontaneous segregation or multi-functional colloidal solutions, and understanding nanoscale defect structures and their relation to vortex pinning. Again, he has pursued practical application of the CCs in fault current limiters and for high field magnets. Recently they are studying ultrafast CSD growth of REBCO CCs, which is critical to reduce the production cost of YBCO to better enable many commercial applications. A strength of the REBCO studies has been using transmission electron studies to deconstruct the many types of vortex pinning present in the highly engineered films into strong and weak pinning and isotropic and oriented defects. This way of thinking about the various types of pinning defects that are deliberately or otherwise introduced into the REBCO films has been enormously productive. Their TEM studies have found strong evidence for oxygen vacancy pinning (weak and isotropic) whose density correlates well with the strain deduced from x-ray measurements. A colleague wrote that &#8220;Obradors has a knack for being able to provide insightful criticism, both positive and negative, in a very positive way. I am sure that such qualities, in addition to his technical capabilities, contribute to why he has been such a valued European project leader.&#8221; Citation for Obradors&#8216;s award : In recognition of his early studies on bulk melt-textured REBCO and recent studies of chemical solution deposition of REBCO coated conductors, focusing on the underlying materials science and developing them for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Earth Years (3 Martian Years) of Mars Observations by NOMAD on ExoMars TGO</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-263</link>

                On 21st April 2018, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter began its nominal science phase [1]. Since then, for the last 6 and a half years, the NOMAD instrument has taken more than a 100 million spectra in the ultra-violet, visible and infrared.NOMAD, or &amp;#8220;Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery&amp;#8221;, is a suite of three spectrometers: two operate in the infrared and one operates in the 200-650nm range. Of the two infrared spectrometers, &amp;#8220;SO&amp;#8221; is designed primarily for solar occultation observations; and &amp;#8220;LNO&amp;#8221; is primarily designed for nadir observations but can also operate in solar occultation and limb modes [2], and measure Phobos. The ultraviolet-visible spectrometer can do all the above: solar occultation, limb, nadir, and Phobos and Deimos observations [3].The very high resolving power of the infrared SO and LNO spectrometers (~17000 and ~10000 &amp;#160;respectively [4]) mean that they are well suited for measuring atmospheric absorption lines, and are therefore able to measure clouds [5], dust [6], H2O [7], [8], CO [9], [10], CO2 (for temperature and pressure)[11], [12] and HCl [13] in solar occultation mode, plus their isotopes such as HDO [14] and H37CL [15]. SO spectra can also be used to put upper limits on trace gases that are not detected, such as CH4 [16] and HF. In nadir, LNO is primarily measuring H2O [17] and CO [18] in the atmosphere and the albedo/composition of the surface [19], [20]. Work is being done the constrain the potential 2.7&amp;#181;m hydration band in Phobos spectra.The ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, &amp;#8220;UVIS&amp;#8221;, measures O3 and dust/aerosols in both solar occultation [21] and nadir modes [22], in addition to Phobos and Deimos [23]. Of particular note is the ongoing work to observe the limb of Mars during both the day and night, to measure the various airglow emission lines present in the limb spectra [24], [25], [26], [27].Also, calibration efforts are continually ongoing to improve detection limits and retrieval accuracies.In this presentation we will show the latest results from NOMAD, and describe how scientists outside the NOMAD team can also access all the latest data generated by the instrument.&amp;#160;References[1]&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; A.
