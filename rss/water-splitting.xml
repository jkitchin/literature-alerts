      <title>Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Fundamental Understanding and Electrocatalysts Design</title>

                Water electrolysis driven by &#8220;green electricity&#8220; is an ideal technology to realize energy conversion and store renewable energy into hydrogen. With the development of proton exchange membrane (PEM), water electrolysis in acidic media suitable for many situations with an outstanding advantage of high gas purity has attracted significant attention. Compared with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a kinetic sluggish process that needs a higher overpotential. Especially in acidic media, OER process poses higher requirements for the electrocatalysts, such as high efficiency, high stability and low costs. This review focuses on the acidic OER electrocatalysis, reaction mechanisms, and critical parameters used to evaluate performance. Especially the modification strategies applied in the design and construction of new&#8208;type electrocatalysts are also summarized. The characteristics of traditional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts developed in recent decades are compared and discussed. Finally, the current challenges for the most promising acidic OER electrocatalysts are presented, together with a perspective for future water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Pd@CoFe Alloys on N-Doped Carbon Derived from Charred Tissue Paper as Synergistic Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/5540018</link>
      <description>Narayanamoorthy Bhuvanendran, R. Selva Kumar, Sae Youn Lee, International Journal of Energy Research. 2024(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392819052

                Integrating more active components into a catalyst material could facilitate the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. In this study, we developed a multifunctional electrocatalyst, namely, Pd alloyed with Co-Fe deposited on N-doped mesoporous carbon derived from tissue paper (Pd@Co-Fe/N-TDC). The synergism in Pd@Co-Fe/N-TDC, stemming from the interatomic alloy between Pd and Co-Fe, N-doped mesoporous carbon with defective surfaces, distribution of polyhedral Pd nanoparticles, and strong metal-support interfacial interaction, resulted in significantly high electrocatalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Pd@Co-Fe/N-TDC was found to be an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, and this was evidenced by a high onset potential (1.01 V) and kinetic current density (2.6 mA/cm2) for the ORR and by a low overpotential (296 mV) and a low Tafel slope value (38 mV/dec) for the OER, along with a small &#916;E of 736 mV. The catalyst also exhibited high durability for both ORR and OER, even after 10000 and 5000 cycles, respectively. Theoretical assessment provides an insight into the synergism of active metal sites in Pd@Co-Fe/N-TDC, which showed its potential for use as a non-Pt electrocatalyst for energy applications.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic activity of MnxOy-derived metal-organic frameworks for Lithium-ion batteries, Hydrogen evolution reaction and Oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2024.107504</link>
      <description>Thoa Le, Hoa Thi Lai, Tuan Loi Nguyen, Ngoc Quang Tran, Nhat Quang Minh Tran, Linh H&#7891; Th&#249;y Nguy&#7877;n, T&#226;n L&#234; Ho&#224;ng &#272;o&#224;n, Anh Tu&#7845;n Thanh Ph&#7841;m, C.K. Jayasankar, Bumjoon Jang, Jongill Hong, Th&#7855;ng B&#225;ch Phan, Solid State Sciences. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392820671

                The electrocatalytic activity of MnxOy materials derived from the metal-organic framework (Mn-BTC) was investigated in dry (for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)) and wet (for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) conditions while observing the phase transformation from annealing Mn-BTC in the air. As a result, the partial &#945;-MnO2, Mn3O4, and Mn2O3 phases were formed at 300, 500, and 700 &#176;C, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of MnxOy materials follows the order (Mn3O4 &gt; Mn2O3 &gt; &#945;-MnO2 &gt; Mn-BTC) in both dry and wet conditions. For instance, Mn3O4 electrodes delivered an initial discharge/charge capacity of 1302/815 mAh g&#8722;1 with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 62.6% when used as anodes for LIBs. They also exhibited a lower Tafel slope of 116 and 54 mV dec&#8722;1 when applied to HER and OER, respectively. The structural analysis showed that the best electrocatalytic activity of Mn3O4 samples originated from the spinel Mn3O4 structure with Mn2/Mn3+ ions occupying the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, high electrical conductivity and small grain size. This study provides insights into the role of physicochemical properties in controlling MnxOy phases from Mn-BTC materials via the annealing process towards applications as potential electrode materials for LIBs, HER, and OER.</description>

                Hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting (EWS) presents a viable solution for addressing the fossil energy crisis. However, the commercial viability of this approach is impeded by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is urgently needed to develop efficient, stable, and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we comprehensively design and investigate a phosphate ion and Fe3+ codecorating Ni(OH)2/NiOOH electrocatalyst (Pi-Fe:NiOH) for OER. This codecoration induces multiple synergistic effects, which include an increase in the interlayer water content for the internal OER, altering the OER mechanism, facilitating proton transport across the layers, and improving the stability of Pi-Fe:NiOH. Consequently, Pi-Fe:NiOH exhibits a high OER activity with overpotentials of 118 &#177; 1 and 222 &#177; 4 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. More impressively, it maintains stable operation at a high current density of around 300 mA cm&#8211;2 for at least 500 h, much better than the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH electrocatalyst (NiOH) for less than 6 h at a current density below 200 mA cm&#8211;2. These findings offer insights for the design of anion&#8211;cation codoped hydroxide eletrocatalysts, paving a way for the development of efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is a sustainable way to produce hydrogen energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode always has sluggish kinetics and low energy conversion efficiency, which is the major bottleneck for water splitting. In this paper, the electronic structure of the Co3O4/carbon composites was regulated by anion doping. The F-doped carbon substrate is compounded with ZIF-67, and the active component Co3O4 is encapsulated in the skeleton formed by ZIF-67. The prepared hybrid nanocomposite catalyst F-Co3O4@NF has excellent OER performance. It requires an overpotential of only 172 mV with the current density of 50 mA cm-2, and the Tafel slope is 88 mV dec-1. It can maintain good stability after 24 hours of continuous operation, and the catalytic activity exceeds most of the similar series of catalysts. The characterization show that F doping can affect the catalytic activity in the form of adjusting the electronic structure and lifting d band center. These structural changes effectively optimize the adsorption/desorption capacity of the composite catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen intermediates in the catalytic process, thereby improving the catalytic activity for alkaline oxygen evolution.</description>

      <title>Activity trends of Pd clusters supported on C2N for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions</title>

                Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for future renewable energy technology. Here, we use first-principles calculations combined with genetic algorithm to determine the structures of various Pd clusters supported on experimentally available C2N monolayer and evaluate the OER and ORR performance. Our findings show that the activity of the supported Pd clusters is closely linked to the local geometrical and electronic structure of the active site. Furthermore, we establish the activity trends of the clusters based on the adsorption free energies of intermediates. In particular, C2N supported Pd7 and Pd8 clusters exhibit outstanding OER activity with low overpotentials. We identify a volcano relation for the OER on the clusters, suggesting that the high activity of the cluster is related to the moderate adsorption strength of intermediates. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the second water formation is the potential-determining step for ORR on the clusters due to the strong adsorption of *OH. Additionally, we identify a linear scaling relationship between the ORR overpotentials and adsorption free energies of *OH, demonstrating that reducing the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on Pd clusters can improve the activity. This work unravels the activity trends of cluster catalysts and provides strategies for the rational design of highly efficient single-cluster catalysts for OER and ORR.</description>

                Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (Vo) and form the Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; (NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8722;&#948;), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; with a low overpotential (&#951;) of 280 mV at j = 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 80 h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8722;&#948; is more stable due to strong Mn&#8208;O bond and synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4&#8722;&#948; after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn&#8722;O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.</description>

                Abstract Organic supramolecular photocatalysts have garnered widespread attention due to their adjustable structure and exceptional photocatalytic activity. Herein, a novel bis&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl&#8208;substituent naphthalenediimide self&#8208;assembly supramolecular photocatalyst (SA&#8208;NDI&#8208;BCOOH) with efficient dual&#8208;functional photocatalytic performance is successfully constructed. The large molecular dipole moment and short&#8208;range ordered stacking structure of SA&#8208;NDI&#8208;BCOOH synergistically create a giant internal electric field (IEF), resulting in a remarkable 6.7&#8208;fold increase in its charge separation efficiency. Additionally, the tetracarboxylic structure of SA&#8208;NDI&#8208;BCOOH greatly enhances its hydrophilicity. Thus, SA&#8208;NDI&#8208;BCOOH demonstrates efficient dual&#8208;functional activity for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, with rates of 372.8 and 3.8 &#181;mol h &#8722;1 , respectively. Meanwhile, a notable apparent quantum efficiency of 10.86% at 400 nm for hydrogen evolution is achieved, prominently surpassing many reported supramolecular photocatalysts. More importantly, with the help of dual co&#8208;catalysts, it exhibits photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H 2 and O 2 evolution rates of 3.2 and 1.6 &#181;mol h &#8722;1 . Briefly, this work sheds light on enhancing the IEF by controlling the molecular polarity and stacking structure to dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance of supramolecular materials.</description>

                Abstract Merely all transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials reconstruct into similar oxyhydroxides during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), severely limiting the options for a tailored OER catalyst design. In such reconstructions, initial constituent p&#8208;block elements take a sacrificial role and leach into the electrolyte as oxyanions, thereby losing the ability to tune the catalyst's properties systematically. From a thermodynamic point of view, indium is expected to behave differently and should remain in the solid phase under alkaline OER conditions. However, the structural behavior of transition metal indium phases during the OER remains unexplored. Herein, are synthesized intermetallic cobalt indium (CoIn 3 ) nanoparticles and revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning transmission microscopy that they undergo phase segregation to cobalt oxyhydroxide and indium hydroxide. The obtained cobalt oxyhydroxide outperforms a metallic&#8208;cobalt&#8208;derived one due to more accessible active sites. The observed phase segregation shows that indium behaves distinctively differently from most p&#8208;block elements and remains at the electrode surface, where it can form lasting interfaces with the active metal oxo phases.</description>

                Abstract The generation of green hydrogen by water splitting is identified as a key strategic energy technology, and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the desirable technologies for converting renewable energy sources into hydrogen. However, the harsh anode environment of PEMWE and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four&#8208;electron transfer result in a large overpotential, which limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen production, and thus efficient electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetic process. In recent years, noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts (e.g., Ru/Ir&#8208;based metal/oxide electrocatalysts) have received much attention due to their unique catalytic properties, and have already become the dominant electrocatalysts for the acidic OER process and are applied in commercial PEMWE devices. However, these noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts still face the thorny problem of conflicting performance and cost. In this review, first, noble metal Ru/Ir&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts are briefly classified according to their forms of existence, and the OER catalytic mechanisms are outlined. Then, the focus is on summarizing the improvement strategies of Ru/Ir&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts with respect to their activity and stability over recent years. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of noble metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.</description>
