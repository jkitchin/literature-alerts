      <title>Magnetic Field Effect on the Electrocatalytic Activity of Cobalt-Phosphate Oxyhydroxide Oxygen Evolving Thin Films</title>

                We demonstrate a 30 &#8211; 40% enhancement in electrocatalytic current for water splitting with an externally applied magnetic field of 1.5 T. The observed effect is unvaried by the presence of a cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide catalyst and is attributed to the removal of O2 gas bubbles at the surface of the electrode. The results indicate that the applied magnetic field acts in concert with the electrocatalyst to further lower the overpotential of water oxidation, highlighting the importance for more detailed studies of magnetic field effects in electrocatalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Pt-doped CoFe layered double hydroxide derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework for efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.111</link>

                Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a class of promising metal organic frameworks (MOFs) material, display high porosity and chemical/thermal stability. However, there are problems such as few active sites and restricted exposed active areas, which limit the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of catalysts. Here, starting from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67), we have successfully synthesized Pt-doped CoFe layered double hydroxide (Pt/CoFe LDH) catalysts for efficient OER catalysis. The obtained Pt/CoFe LDH-4 catalysts provides large surface areas and abundant active sites, which further improves the OER performance. In detail, the Pt/CoFe LDH-4 exhibits a lower overpotential of 263 mV at a current density of 40 mA cm</description>

      <title>Evaluation of individual metal contribution on active sites tailoring in multimetallic oxygen evolution catalytic system</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.167</link>
      <description>Jiejie Feng, Liling Wei, Huayi Li, Jianquan Shen, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 678(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4401802739

                Synergistic effects among different metals have positioned multimetallic electrocatalysts as promising facilitators for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), though understanding their precise mechanisms has remained elusive. Delving into the unique contributions of individual metals is crucial for comprehending the complex synergy within multimetallic systems. In this study, we employed quinary (Co, Ce, Fe, Cu, and Mn) molybdates as a model to systematically investigate the role of each metal species in tailoring active sites. Our systematic analyses unveiled the presence of crucial oxygen vacancies, which can be considered as the active sites in OER. Comparative analyses of the top-performing quinary molybdates and their quaternary counterparts highlighted distinct electronic interactions and varying densities of oxygen vacancies, indicative of the diverse electron and vacancy engineering capabilities inherent to different metals. Mott-schottky plots demonstrated the predominant contribution of Mn to specific catalytic activity, followed by Ce, Fe, Cu, and Co. Leveraging an in-situ methanol probing method, it was found that the introduction of Cu, Ce, Fe, and Mn weakened intermediate adsorption, with Mn and Ce having the most significant effects, whereas Co strengthened adsorption. This work can advance our comprehension of the role played by individual metals within multimetallic catalysts, thereby promoting a more profound understanding of synergistic effects.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of a Binder-Free Manganese/Cobalt Bilayer Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad7294</link>
      <description>Takayuki Kiso, Tomoya Higo, Wataru Yoshida, Yu Katayama, Masaharu Nakayama, Journal of The Electrochemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401732279

                Abstract We have developed a bilayer film comprising cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) underlayer and manganese dioxide (MnO2) upper layer, which are active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. The bilayer bifunctional catalyst is synthesized by electrodepositing cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) on a porous carbon paper (CP) and subsequently immersing the obtained Co(OH)2/CP in a potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution without binders or conductive additives. Specifically, electron transfer between the already-deposited Co(OH)2 and MnO4&#8211; proceeded in the solution, yielding MnO2, until all the Co ions become trivalent, after which self-terminates. The proposed method only allows for the construction of the minimum required bifunctional catalyst only at the reaction site of the gas-diffusion electrode, i.e., at the so-called three-phase interface, thus remarkably increasing catalyst utilization while improving reactant and product diffusions. The developed catalyst shows stable MnO2/CoOOH cycles at |20| mA cm&#8211;2 with a minimal difference (0.764 V) between the OER and ORR potentials, reflecting the structural advantage of the proposed catalyst. This work proposes efficient bifunctional catalysts having spatially separated OER/ORR reactive sites that can be synthesized via the simple and scalable electrochemical method, which does not require the skill and optimization of binder and electron-conducting additives.</description>

      <title>Water Splitting in Alkaline Electrolytes at Elevated Temperatures Using Nickel-, Tin-, and Iron-Coated Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c02617</link>

                The temperature dependences of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated on Ni-mesh (NM) electrodes modified with catalysts comprising any combination of Ni, Sn, and Fe, as well as on unmodified NM electrodes in aqueous alkaline solutions maintained at 25, 40, and 50 &#176;C. The reactions required appropriate temperature compensations from the indicated potentials of the reference electrode and the thermodynamic equilibrium potentials of the corresponding reactions. The results indicated that the intrinsic overpotentials of all electrodes for the OER and HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 decreased with the increasing electrolyte temperatures. The changes in these intrinsic overpotentials also depended on the catalyst: for example, the OER overpotentials of Ni&#8211;Sn&#8211;Fe/NM and the unmodified NM electrodes decreased by 0.014 and 0.028 V, respectively, as the temperature changed from 25 to 50 &#176;C. Conversely, the HER overpotentials of Ni&#8211;Sn/NM and the unmodified NM electrodes decreased by 0.121 and 0.144 V, respectively, as the temperature changed similarly. The corresponding Tafel slope did not display any significant change with the temperature for any of the catalysts, although the exchange current density (j0) increased with increasing temperature. The electrochemical impedance measurements revealed that the charge-transfer resistance values of the Ni&#8211;Sn&#8211;Fe- and Ni&#8211;Sn-modified NM electrodes were significantly lower than that of the unmodified NM electrode. Furthermore, the electrolytic tests at constant current density revealed that the Ni&#8211;Sn&#8211;Fe- and Ni&#8211;Sn-modified NM electrodes exhibited high stability against temperature changes, whereas the unmodified NM electrodes exhibited significant irreversible degradation when electrolyzed at 40 or 50 &#176;C. Next, a two-electrode cell comprising a Ni&#8211;Sn&#8211;Fe/NM anode and Ni&#8211;Sn/NM cathode was assembled. The cell voltage during electrolysis at constant current (600 mA cm&#8211;2) was 2.107 V at 25 &#176;C, decreasing to 1.945 V at 50 &#176;C. However, that of the symmetric bare NM//bare NM was 2.910 V at 25 &#176;C, decreasing to 2.633 V at 50 &#176;C.</description>

      <title>One Stone, Three-Birds Approach: Ultra-active Ru/N, S-MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CNTs Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting in Wide Electrode Applications (NF, GC, and CC)</title>

                The construction of exceptionally multifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for various applications, but it poses significant challenges. A novel electrocatalyst, denoted as Ru/N, S-MoO2/CNTs, was successfully synthesized using a combination of mechano-grinding and hydrothermal/calcination techniques. The Ru/N, S-MoO2/CNTs demonstrates ultrasmall overpotentials of 12 and 163 mV in NF, 51 and 167 mV in GCE, and 54 and 173 mV in CC for HER and OER, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline medium. To accomplish electrocatalytic OWS, a current density of 10 mA/cm2 can be obtained by using a cell voltage of 1.446 V. Theoretical studies demonstrated that the inclusion of Ru, N, and S triggers a change in the composition of MoO2; produces oxygen vacancies; and forms Ru, N, and S-oxygen-Mo catalytic centers. The combination of Ru, N, and S nanoclusters; Ru, N, and S-oxygen-Mo catalytic centers; and OVs-enriched MoO2 would position it among the top electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Dual Hydrogen Production System: Synergistic Effect of Ru and Ce Over Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Nanotubes Drives Hydrogen Evolution and Formaldehyde Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202406107</link>
      <description>Hongjie Yu, Lijun Zhang, Shaojian Jiang, Wenke Liu, Kai Deng, Ziqiang Wang, You Xu, Jin Zhang, Liang Wang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401738657

                Abstract Water splitting for hydrogen production is limited by high cell voltage and low energy conversion efficiencies due to the slow kinetic process of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an electrolytic system is constructed in which the cathode and anode co&#8208;release H 2 at ultra&#8208;low input voltage using formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) instead of OER. The prepared RuCe co&#8208;doped Cu 2 O nanotubes on copper foam (RuCe&#8208;Cu 2 O/CF) are used as electrode materials for the HER&#8208;FOR system. A current density of 0.8 A cm &#8722;2 is achieved at 0.55 V, and a stable hydrogen production process is realized at both the cathode and anode. Density functional theory (DFT) studies show that the synergistic effect of Ru and Ce drives: i) the d &#8208;band center of RuCe&#8208;Cu 2 O/CF away from the Fermi energy level; ii) the energy barrier for the C&#9472;H cracking of the H 2 C(OH)O * intermediate in FOR is lowered, which promotes the formation of H 2 from H * , and iii) &#916;G H* tends to 0 (&#8722;0.1 eV), optimizing the reaction kinetics of HER. This work provides a new design for an efficient catalyst for dual hydrogen production systems from water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Rare earth (RE)&#8208;based perovskites are considered as promising platform for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their low cost and tunable structures. However, the systematic synthesis of perovskite catalysts with satisfactory performance has rarely been reported. Herein, a general synthetic protocol for RE&#8208;substituted LaCoO 3 (RE&#8208;LCO) perovskites is demonstrated. Particularly, after loaded with RuO 2 , the as&#8208;prepared RuO 2 :0.2Ce&#8208;LCO hybrid structures exhibit OER performance with a low overpotential of 135 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, together with remarkable long&#8208;term operation, representing one of the most efficient and robust Ru&#8208;based catalysts. Comprehensive experimental results indicate that the enhanced OER mechanism is attributed to the Ce&#8208;substitution, which alters the geometric configuration of CoO 6 octahedra and generates more oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the robust interaction between Ce&#8208;LCO and RuO 2 stabilizes the valence state of Ru site. Theoretical calculations corroborate that Co 3d orbitals overlap with Ce 4f orbitals near the Fermi level, greatly improving the electron transfer between Co and Ce atoms.</description>

                Abstract For the first time, a Co and Fe bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (BMOF) nanosheet array (NSA) employing 5,5&#8242;,5&#8242;'&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tris(azanediyl)triisophthalic acid (H 6 TDPAT) as the organic ligand is in situ controllably self&#8208;assembled on iron foam (IF). The obtained IF@CoFe&#8208;TDPAT NSA exhibits an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity much superior to most reported catalysts and even Ru and Ir&#8208;based ones and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity higher than most metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based catalysts. The excellent bifunctional activities are ascribed to the superhydrophilic (3D) vertically aligned, interconnected NSA of CoFe&#8208;TDPAT MOF with in situ activated coordinatively unsaturated metal sites remarkably enhancing OH &#8722; and H 2 O adsorption, accelerating electron transfer and transport, and facilitating O 2 /H 2 diffusion. When adopted as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting, it achieves 300 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.753 V and exhibits negligible current decay after 100 h. This performance is the highest of recently reported noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free water electrolyzers, and even much higher than those using commercial noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. This work offers an economical, facile, and controllable strategy to fabricate low&#8208;cost, highly efficient, and bifunctional BMOF nanostructured array electrodes for large&#8208;current&#8208;density water splitting, and also sheds light on the mechanisms for in situ self&#8208;assembly and outstanding OER and HER performance of 3D free&#8208;standing complex&#8208;organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;based BMOF nanoarchitectures.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen energy with a high fuel value is considered to be one of the most important renewable and clean energy sources in sustainable energy. Electrocatalytic water splitting is the best way to produce hydrogen sustainably on a large scale. In this work, the sand rose&#8208;like MoSe 2 /NiSe/NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) catalyst is obtained by a two&#8208;step hydrothermal method for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure is observed by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS, and the results showed that there is strong electronic interaction among the components, which promotes electron transfer and improves catalytic activity. In the alkaline environment, the catalyst exhibits excellent HER and OER performance, the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 requires only 130 mV and 136 mV overpotential, respectively. In the water splitting system composed of MoSe 2 /NiSe/NiFe&#8208;LDH as both cathode and anode, only 1.51 V voltage reaches the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and workes continuously for more than 120 h at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. The Faraday efficiency of hydrogen production is close to 100 %. This study provides a promising strategy for the preparation of efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.</description>

                Water splitting is an important approach to hydrogen production. But the efficiency of the process is always controlled by the oxygen evolution reaction process. In this study, a three-dimensional nickel&#8211;molybdenum binary nanoarray microstructure electrocatalyst is successfully synthesized. It is grown uniformly on Ni foam using a hydrothermal method. Attributed to their unique nanostructure and controllable nature, the Ni-Mo-based nanoarray samples show superior reactivity and durability in oxygen evolution reactions. The series of Ni-Mo-based electrocatalysts presents a competitive overpotential of 296 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 for an OER in 1.0 M KOH, corresponding with a low Tafel slope of 121 mV dec&#8722;1. The three-dimensional nanostructure has a large double-layer capacitance and plenty of channels for ion transfer, which demonstrates more active sites and improved charge transmission. This study provides a valuable reference for the development of non-precious catalysts for water splitting.</description>

      <title>Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Mn Electrocatalysts for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Simulated/Alkaline Seawater and Overall Performance in the Splitting of Alkaline Seawater</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings14081074</link>

                The perfect strategy for the generation of green and renewable hydrogen (H2) fuels is the direct electrocatalytic splitting of plentiful seawater rather than scarce freshwater. One of the half-reactions taking place during the electrocatalytic splitting of seawater is oxygen evolution (OER). However, the OER is affected by slow four-electron transfer kinetics as well as competitive chlorine evolution reactions (CERs) in seawater. To overcome the kinematic and competitive barriers of seawater splitting and achieve an excellent overall performance of seawater splitting, we herein report a facile, low-cost, one-step fabrication procedure of 3D structured nickel&#8211;manganese (NiMn) coatings using a dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) technique. The electrocatalytic activities of the thus synthesized catalytic materials for OER in simulated seawater (0.5 M NaCl + 1 M KOH, denoted as SSW) and alkaline natural seawater (natural seawater + 1 M KOH, denoted as ASW) were investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at varying temperatures from 25 to 75 &#176;C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and inductively coupled plasma&#8211;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8211;OES) were used to examine the surface morphology and composition of the prepared catalysts. It was found that the prepared NiMn/Ti-1 catalyst in a plating bath containing a molar ratio of 1:1 Ni2+:Mn2+ and having the lowest Mn loading of 13.43 &#181;g cm&#8722;2 exhibited quite reasonable activity for OER in Cl&#8722; ion rich SSW and ASW. To achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in SSW and ASW, the NiMn/Ti-1 electrocatalyst requires overpotentials of 386 and 388 mV, respectively. In addition, this optimal bimetallic electrocatalyst also demonstrated superior long-run stability at 1.81 V (vs. RHE) and 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for 24 h in both working electrolytes. Impressively, the two-electrode electrolyzer&#8212;NiMn/Ti-5(&#8722;)||NiMn/Ti-1(+)&#8212;needs only 1.619 V to deliver 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density for overall alkaline seawater electrolysis, which is even 0.075 V lower than the noble metal-based electrolyzer (Pt(&#8722;)||NiMn/Ti-1(+)).</description>

      <title>Crystal Water in Minerals Modulates Oxygen Activation for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>

                Sunlight-responsive minerals contribute significantly to biogeochemical cycles by activating oxygen (O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the role of crystal water, incorporated into minerals through hydration during rock cycles, in O2 activation remains largely unexplored. Here, we construct tungstite models containing oxygen vacancies to elucidate the modulation of mineral-based ROS dynamics by the synergy between oxygen vacancy and crystal water. Crystal water promotes the protonation process of superoxide anion radicals to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and alleviates its decomposition. This mineral-based H2O2 photosynthesis system efficiently eliminates organic pollutants in a sequential light&#8211;dark reaction. Furthermore, this synergy effect can extend to other metal oxide minerals such as TiO2, SnO2, CuO, ZnO, and Bi2O3. Our results illuminate an overlooked pathway for modulating the protonation process by immobilized water in hydrous minerals, playing a crucial role in ROS storage and migration and pollutant dynamics in a natural environment throughout the day/night cycle.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction plays a vital role in modern energy conversion and storage, and developing cost-efficient oxygen evolution reaction catalysts with industrially relevant activity and durability is highly desired but still challenging. Here, we report an efficient and durable FeNi hydroxide organic framework nanosheet array catalyst that competently affords long-term oxygen evolution reaction at industrial-grade current densities in alkaline electrolyte. The desirable high-intensity performance is attributed to three aspects as follows. First, two-dimensional nanosheet porous arrays with maximum specific surface facilitate mass/charge transfer to accommodate high-current-density catalysis. Second, in situ derived FeNi hydroxide motifs offer bimetallic synergistic catalysis centers with high intrinsic activity. Third, carboxyl ligands alleviate metal oxidation favorable for charge tolerability against peroxidation dissolution under strong polarization. As a result, this catalyst requires an overpotential of only 280 mV to deliver high current density up to 1 A/cm2 with long durability over 1000 h. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer with this catalyst alternative demonstrates an increased economic effectiveness compared to commercial levels at present. Developing cost-efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is crucial for various modern energy technologies. Here the authors report an efficient and durable NiFe hydroxide organic framework catalyst for water oxidation at 1 A/cm2 with long durability over 1000 h.</description>

                Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M = V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8208;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Constructing Dual&#8208;Phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 Heterostructure as an Efficient Trifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction, Oxygen Evolution and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400678</link>
      <description>Wenjie Wang, Yuqing Chen, Shushan Qiao, Jing Zhao, Wenlong Zhao, Yike Wei, Yanhong Tang, Chengbin Liu, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401819899

                Designing robust, efficient and inexpensive trifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting devices. To this end, constructing heterogenous structures based on transition metals stands out as an effective strategy. Herein, a dual&#8208;phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 heterostructure grown on porous N, S&#8208;codoped carbon substrate (Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC) via a one&#8208;pot synthesis is investigated as the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER electrocatalyst. The optimized Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2 exhibits that ORR has a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V (vs. RHE) and the overpotentials at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER and HER are 280 and 89 mV, respectively, superior to most transition&#8208;metal based trifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) has a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.41 V), large capacity (804 mA h g&#8211;1) and highly stable cyclability (97 h at 10 mA cm&#8211;2). In addition, the prepared Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2&#8208;based ZAB in series can self&#8208;drive the corresponding water electrolyzer. The dual&#8208;phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 heterostructure provides not only multi&#8208;type active sites to drive the ORR, OER and HER, but also high&#8208;speed charge transfer channels between two phases to improve the synergistic effect and reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                Abstract Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm 2 ) on reactive MnO 2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO 2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O (II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and 283 mV at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 , together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO 2 at 1.53 V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.</description>

      <title>Preparation of Alkali Metal Iridates as Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Via Thermal Transformation of Amorphous Iridium (oxy)hydroxides.</title>

                Achieving efficient water&#8208;splitting under acidic conditions for hydrogen production is severely limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Overcoming this obstacle is vital to realise effective electrolysers and deliver a hydrogen&#8208;driven economy. Iridium oxides remain one of the only viable catalysts under acidic conditions due to their corrosion resistance, however, a fine balance exists between the activity and stability of differing oxide morphologies. We have previously shown that heat&#8208;treating high&#8208;activity amorphous iridium oxyhydroxide in the presence of residual lithium carbonate leads to the formation of lithium&#8208;layered iridium oxide, suppressing the formation of low&#8208;activity crystalline rutile IrO2. We now report our recent work on the synthesis of similar compounds, Na&#8208;IrOx and K&#8208;IrOx, featuring similarly layered crystalline structures. Electrocatalytic tests confirm Li&#8208;IrOx has similar electrocatalytic activity as commercial amorphous IrO2&#183;2H2O and with increasing size of the intercalated cation, the activity towards the OER decreases. However, the synthesised electrocatalysts show greater stability than crystalline rutile IrO2 and amorphous IrO2&#183;2H2O, suggesting these compounds could be viable alternatives for industrial PEM electrolysers where durability is a key performance criterion.</description>

      <title>Perfect Is Perfect: Nickel Prussian Blue Analogue as A High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202413866</link>
      <description>Yamin Xi, Yitong Xiang, Chaoqi Zhang, Tong Bao, Yingying Zou, Jin Zou, Guangfeng Wei, Lei Wang, Hongyi Xu, Chengzhong Yu, Chao Liu, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401829115

                Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are a large family of functional materials with diverse applications such as in electrochemical fields. However, their use in the emerging two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf&#8208;like morphology composed of interconnected small&#8208;size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni&#8208;N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six&#8208;coordinated environment that results in high selectivity. The "perfect" structure including stoichiometric composition and ideal facet exposure leads to a high selectivity of ~100% and H2O2 yield of 5.7 mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, superior to the reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts and most other electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The introduction of noble metal into spinel structure is an effective strategy to develop efficient oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts. Herein, surface Co oct is substituted by Ru oct in Ru x &#8208;Mn 0.5 Co 2.5&#8208;x O 4 /NCNTs by ion&#8208;exchange, where presence of Ru oct &#9472;O&#9472;Co oct unit facilitates electron transfer. This strong electron coupling effect leads downward shift in d&#8208;band center and a narrowing of d&#8208;p bandgap. The increased charge density of Co oct bridged with Ru oct dioxygen optimizes adsorption of oxygen intermediates ( * OH) and occupation of electrons in e g &#8208;orbital octahedral. The measured ORR/OER voltage difference is only 0.71 V. The peak power density of assembled zinc&#8211;air battery reaches 148.8 mW h cm &#8722;2 , and energy density at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 reaches 813.6 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 , approaching a theoretical value of 820 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 . The catalyst demonstrates stable operation for over 500 h at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and over 200 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides new insights to guide fabrication of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts.</description>

                Ball milling, an eco-friendly material synthesis route, was used to produce a Ti-based precursor from a mixture of metallic Ti and TiO2 powders to obtain a corrosion-resistant and conductive support for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium. The obtained materials were subsequently impregnated with Ni and Fe salts before being thermally treated under hydrogen. Thanks to this synthesis route, composite materials consisting of a Ni- and Fe-containing active phase deposited onto a TiyOx substrate were obtained. The chemical nature of phases composing this precursor material directly depends on the Ti/TiO2 mass ratio. For a mass ratio of 50%, the Ti-based precursor (sample labeled Ti50), initially composed of TiO2 and Ti hydride phases, is transformed, after impregnation with Fe and Ni salts and heat treatment under H2, into a highly electron conductive Ti2O3 phase, leading to a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The influence of active phase loading and the Ni/Fe atomic ratio on the OER activity was subsequently investigated by performing electrochemical experiments. Different physicochemical techniques (X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)) were performed to characterize the composition, structure, and morphology of the different composite catalysts in order to evidence a correlation between materials' properties and their electroactivity toward OER. The sample labeled 30 atom % NiFe (50&#8211;50)-Ti50 sample (i.e, Ni/Fe isoatomic ratio and atomic percent of the Ni- and Fe-containing active phase of 30%) appears as the most efficient material, since an overpotential of only 310 mV is required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2. A chronopotentiometry test was carried out to ensure the stability of electrochemical performances after a long-term use of 7 days. Finally, post-mortem Raman spectroscopy and TEM measurements were performed to inquire into surface restructuring phenomena affecting the nanoheterostructured catalyst under working conditions.</description>

      <title>Rapid Electron Migration by Oxygen Vacancy from the Substitution of N for O in BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to Boost Piezoelectric Catalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Degradation</title>

                Introducing heterogeneous elements into the lattice of materials to form oxygen vacancies can regulate the local electron density on their surfaces and enhance their piezoelectric catalytic performance. However, avoiding the use of highly reducing substances while regulating defects through a mild strategy remains a major challenge. This work synthesized defect-state BaTiO3 piezoelectric catalytic materials through a two-step solvent-free strategy and annealing under different atmospheres. The experimental results indicate that oxygen vacancies not only increase the free charge density of the material itself but also serve as "electron traps", promoting the directional transfer of electrons and significantly improving the separation efficiency of charge carriers. It is worth mentioning that BTO-OV-1 synthesized under nitrogen atmosphere exhibits enhanced piezoelectric catalytic activity due to abundant oxygen defects, with a yield of 504 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1 of H2 generated by piezoelectric catalytic splitting of water within 100 min, and also exhibits excellent performance in piezoelectric catalytic degradation of organic pollutants. This study enriches the experimental devices for regulating oxygen vacancies and has a certain reference value for expanding the application research of highly active BaTiO3 materials in the field of piezoelectric catalysis.</description>

                Abstract The development of electricity&#8208;driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a potent solution for energy storage applications. In recent years, there is a surge in interest in designing transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with stable linkages, presenting an efficient alternative to noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Transition metal complexes linked by salen ligands garner considerable attention due to their capacity to chelate and stabilize metal ions. This work presents a novel approach by strategically incorporating the metal&#8211;salen core into a porous organic polymer (POP) backbone, thereby fabricating a highly effective electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution. The judicious selection of metal&#8211;salen active sites, coupled with the intramolecular free volume (IMFV) of the triptycene core and the high specific surface area of the salen&#8211;POPs, result in superior OER activity. By precisely tuning the structure through variation of the transition metal in the salen unit, deep insights are gained into their electrocatalytic behavior. Notably, the most efficient catalyst, Ni&#8208;DHDA&#8208;TAT, exhibits an impressively low overpotential ( &#951; 10 ) of &#8776; 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for OER (in 1 m KOH). Further, Ni&#8208;DHDA&#8208;TAT retains its activity even after 50 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles with negligible degradation in its initial performance.</description>

                Accelerated anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases due to increasing energy demands has created a negative impact on our planet. Therefore, replacement of fossil by renewable energy resources has become of paramount interest. It is within this setting that organic photocatalysts have emerged as a new generation of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for the conversion of solar radiation into chemical energy. In 2014, the first example of a covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction has been reported by our group, which has not only marked the beginning of COF photocatalysis for solar fuel production, but also helped to accelerate research into &#8220;soft photocatalysis&#8221;. In the last decade, significant progress has been made towards developing COFs as robust, molecularly precise platforms emulating artificial photosynthesis. This mini&#8208;review commemorates the 10th year anniversary of COF photocatalysis and gives a brief historical overview of the milestones in the field. We review milestones in the development of COFs for solar fuel production and related photocatalytic transformations, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, overall water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, oxygen reduction and alcohol oxidation. We discuss lessons learnt for the design of structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationships in COF photocatalysts, and future perspectives and challenges for the field.</description>

      <title>Nickel Hydroxysulfide Electrocatalyst Promotes Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Saving Hydrogen Production</title>

                The occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) almost consumes most of the electric energy of hydrogen production by electrocatalytic water splitting. The energy required in the process of electrochemical hydrogen production can be reduced by choosing urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of OER. In this work, nickel hydroxysulfide is synthesized on nickel foam (NiSOH/NF) and its electrocatalytic performance was tested in UOR. Experimental results show that the vulcanization catalyst requires a low potential of 1.38 V (vs RHE) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in an electrolyte containing 0.5 M urea, which is 270 mV lower than the conventional OER process. This innovative approach has yielded a substantial reduction in the cell voltage necessary for overall water splitting under two electrode system, thereby enhancing its efficiency and feasibility.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>

                Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M = V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8208;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.</description>

                Integrated application of interface engineering and vacancy engineering is a promising and effective strategy for the design and fabrication of high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, the heterointerface catalyst with rich sulfur vacancies, vs-Ni3S2/Fe2P, was successfully designed and constructed. The strong heterointerface coupling and rich sulfur vacancies in vs-Ni3S2/Fe2P significantly optimize the electronic structure of the catalyst and synergistically improve the inherent catalytic activity. Benefiting from the optimization of the electronic structure, vs-Ni3S2/Fe2P exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline electrolytes. The overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) are 99 and 169 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. Particularly, it achieves an ultrahigh OER performance with an overpotential of 251 mV at 300 mA cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the catalyst also displays outstanding long-term durability. Density functional theory (DFT) computations reveal that the synergy of interface coupling and sulfur vacancies is crucial to optimizing the electronic structure. This study offers a hopeful pathway for the design and construction of durable and efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The utilization of single atoms (SAs) as trifunctional electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction, oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions (NRR, ORR, and OER) is still a formidable challenge. Herein, we devise one&#8208;pot synthesized palladium SAs stabilized on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon palladium SA electrocatalyst (Pd&#8208;SA/NC) as efficient trifunctional electrocatalyst for NRR, ORR, and OER. Pd&#8208;SA/NC performs a robust catalytic activity toward NRR with faradaic efficiency of 22.5% at &#8722;0.25 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the relative Pd utilization efficiency is enhanced by 17&#8208;fold than Pd&#8208;NP/NC. In addition, the half&#8208;wave potential reaches 0.876 V versus RHE, amounting to a 58&#8208;time higher mass activity than commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 is as low as 287 mV for Pd&#8208;SA/NC, outperforming the commercial IrO 2 by 360 times in turnover frequency at 1.6 V versus RHE. Accordingly, the assembled rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) achieves a maximum power density of 170 mW cm &#8722;2 , boosted by 2.3 times than Pt/C&#8211;IrO 2 . Two constructed ZABs efficiently power the NRR&#8208;OER system to electrochemically generate ammonia implying its superior trifunctionality.</description>

                Low-grade ores have received great attention from an economic and environmental perspective due to the shortage of high-grade manganese ore resources. However, it is worth mentioning that the final value of the recovery process must be cost-effective. The extracted Mn2+ ions from the low-grade manganese ore were purified and converted to the desired manganese salt which is used as a Mn2+ source for the synthesis of manganese sulfide nanostructures (MnS). The low-grade oxide ore was treated by reduction roasting using chemically pure sulfur as a reductant. Then, the roasted samples were subjected to selective leaching conditions to extract manganese (Mn). The effects of the roasting and leaching parameters on the leaching efficiencies of Mn and Fe are investigated. The Mn leaching efficiency of 90.67% is obtained under the optimized conditions, whereas the Fe leaching efficiency is &lt;0.01%. Additionally, the electrocatalytic application towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the hydrothermally synthesized MnS was studied in 1 M KOH using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate. The MnS-NF electrode material exhibits an overpotential of 285 mV at a standard current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 75 mV/dec, respectively.</description>

                Transition metal tellurides have emerged as leading materials for energy applications due to their unique electrochemical properties. Here, cobalt telluride (CoTe) is tactically included with MnO2 on a boron nitride template via a hydrothermal method to generate the CoTe/MnO2/BN (CTMOBN) ternary heterostructure composite, which was probed for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water. The CTMOBN material was duly studied via an array of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, including Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The detailed analysis revealed a hierarchical structure for the composite, with the distinct presence of CoTe nanosheets, MnO2 rods, and boron nitride flakes. The catalytic activity of this ternary CTMOBN composite exhibited efficient OER activity in alkaline aqueous media while displaying a relatively low overpotential of 273 mV to reach an anodic current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a fast catalysis rate (Tafel slope &#8764;81 mV/dec). The comparative studies also highlighted the significance of the presence of all three components in the composite for displaying such an excellent electrocatalytic OER activity.</description>

In this paper, the morphology and structure of the materials were characterized by means of SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. It was found that MoS2 has high activity and good stability in HER, and and it has more prospect than noble metal catalysts. In oxygen evolution chemical kinetics, its rich redox potential allowed it to adsorb OH&#8722; on (Co2+/Co3+, Fe2+/Fe3+) and enhanced the activity of OER. The cross-nanosheet structure of the FeCo2O4/MoS2 composite catalyst exposed more catalytic sites and accelerated charge transfer to achieve more efficient mass transfer. FeCo2O4/MoS2 as an anode and cathode was assembled into a two-electrode system in overall water splitting, which showed good catalytic activity. When the composite ratio of FeCo2O4 to MoS2 was 1:0.3, the composite catalyst had the best catalytic activity. The results show that when FeCo2O4/MoS2 is used as a cathode and anode to assemble an alkaline cell, respectively, the voltage for total water electrolysis is 1.59 V at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, it can keep good stability in a 10 h test with electrolyzed water, and its current retention rate is 98.5%.</description>

                Abstract The metal-semiconductor heterostructure has gained interest in the photocatalytic community due to the necessity of comprehending charge dynamics at the interface and the impact of co-catalyst dimensionality change on photocatalyst efficiency. High photocatalytic efficiency attributed to effective charge carrier separation during water splitting, a systematic in-depth study to relate reaction overpotential and interface interaction is performed over 0D-2D and 2D-2D metal-semiconductor heterojunction using density functional theory. Decoration of g&#8722;C3N4 with CoB-based clusters (4 and 8 atoms) and slab alter electronic and optical&amp;#xD;properties. Formation of metal-semiconductor junction based on the work-function difference leads to downward band bending and generates an interfacial electric field (Eif ). Dimensionality and size of metallic co-catalyst highly change the Eif direction&amp;#xD;which affects the migration of the charge carriers. Formation of a large number of reactive sites on either surface due to &#960;-conjugation, and feasibility in electron migration from metal surface imparts reduction/oxidation potential to the surfaces of heterostructure. The presence of such significant properties not only shows an application of studied samples in efficient Hydrogen/Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER/HER) but also briefs about the physics at the interface and the importance of the type of contact between co-catalyst and Photocatalyst.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Performance of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Photoanode by Integrating Electron-Rich Polyoxometalate into Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>

                Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoanodes face challenges such as rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination, slow water oxidation kinetics, and poor surface stability. To tackle these problems, this study incorporates a Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) anion, characterized by a high negative charge and the absence of precious metals, into the MIL-101(Cr)/BiVO4 composite photoanode. The POM anion effectively enhances charge separation and injection within the BiVO4 photoanode under minimal optimization conditions by separating photogenerated holes from the MIL-101 framework. The NiPOM/MIL-101(Cr)/BiVO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), approximately 4 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4. Furthermore, the oxygen evolution reaction yield of the photoanode reaches 36.2 &#956;mol after 90 min of reaction, with faradic efficiencies consistently exceeding 84%, indicating the predominant involvement of photogenerated charge carriers in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. At an applied potential of 1.23 V vs RHE, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) reaches 1.16%. The charge transfer mechanism of the photochemical process reveals that the uniform distribution of the NiPOM cocatalyst within the hydrophilic zeolite cage of MIL-101(Cr) promotes the formation of additional chemically active sites and facilitates electron transfer from its Ni site to the BiVO4 surface, significantly boosting photocurrent density. This mechanism effectively suppresses the dissolution of V5+ ions and enhances the oxidation stability during photoelectrochemical water decomposition. This work presents a novel strategy for designing POM-based molecular synergistic catalysts to enhance the efficiency and stability of PEC water splitting, thereby facilitating the efficient conversion of solar energy to clean hydrogen fuel.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Ion Pumping across Atomically Designed Oxide Heterointerfaces</title>

                Abstract Complex oxide heterointerfaces and heterostructures have demonstrated enormous emergent phenomena over the last decades, attributed to the reconstructions of mis&#8208;matched crystalline structure, polarity, and spin ordering across the heterointerfaces. This work employs the heterostructures of La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 and CaFeO 2.5 as model system to demonstrate an interface&#8208;specific oxygen migration/reconstruction across the interfaces due to the mismatched chemical potential, which dramatically influences the ferromagnetic and electronic states of La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 layer. Specifically, the alternative stacking of octahedral ( O h ) and tetrahedral ( T d ) layers in CaFeO 2.5 are used to form two distinct heterointerfaces, namely the O h &#8208;T d and the O h &#8208;O h interfaces with the adjacent La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 layer. Interestingly, the oxygen ion migrates toward opposite directions across the interface for these two cases, in which the CaFeO 2.5 layer acts as an &#8220;oxygen pump&#8221; and manipulates the oxygen contents of its adjacent La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 layers. Such manipulation leads to a dramatically changed ferromagnetic transition temperature for the heterostructure with the O h &#8208;T d and O h &#8208; O h interface. This work establishes a feasible and efficient strategy to control the oxygen ionic distribution through atomic&#8208;scale interface design and opens up new opportunities to exploit emergent states at the complex oxide heterostructures through selective oxygen ion evolution.</description>

                Abstract The corrosion of SiC f /SiC composites in gas environment threatens their long&#8208;term service in aeroengines as hot&#8208;end structure components. Addition of corrosion&#8208;resistant phases into SiC matrix is a potential strategy to improve the service performance of SiC f /SiC materials. Here, AlN added SiC ceramics were prepared by reactive melt infiltration, and the effect of AlN phase on the oxidation resistance of the ceramics was emphasized. The oxidation tests were performed in dry oxygen and water oxygen atmospheres at 1100&#176;C&#8211;1300&#176;C, respectively. The oxidation mechanism was discussed based on the microstructure evolution of the oxide layer. The results show that the oxide layer is composed of aluminum silicate glass and Al 2 O 3 flakes dispersedly distributed in the glass phase. As the temperature rises, the oxide layer gradually grows and thickens. Finally, a smooth and dense protective layer could be formed on the surface of ceramics to resist oxidation. This study can provide a profound insight to construct SiC f /SiC composites with excellent oxidation resistance.</description>

      <title>Furfural tolerance of mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae selected via ionizing radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution</title>

                Lignocellulose is a renewable and sustainable resource used to produce second-generation biofuel ethanol to cope with the resource and energy crisis. Furfural is the most toxic inhibitor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells produced during lignocellulose treatment, and can reduce the ability of S. cerevisiae to utilize lignocellulose, resulting in low bioethanol yield. In this study, multiple rounds of progressive ionizing radiation was combined with adaptive laboratory evolution to improve the furfural tolerance of S. cerevisiae and increase the yield of ethanol. In this study, the strategy of multiple rounds of progressive X-ray radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution significantly improved the furfural tolerance of brewing yeast. After four rounds of experiments, four mutant strains resistant to high concentrations of furfural were obtained (SCF-R1, SCF-R2, SCF-R3, and SCF-R4), with furfural tolerance concentrations of 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5 g/L, respectively. Among them, the mutant strain SCF-R4 obtained in the fourth round of radiation had a cellular malondialdehyde content of 49.11 nmol/mg after 3 h of furfural stress, a weakening trend in mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, a decrease in accumulated reactive oxygen species, and a cell death rate of 12.60%, showing better cell membrane integrity, stable mitochondrial function, and an improved ability to limit reactive oxygen species production compared to the other mutant strains and the wild-type strain. In a fermentation medium containing 3.5 g/L furfural, the growth lag phase of the SCF-R4 mutant strain was shortened, and its growth ability significantly improved. After 96 h of fermentation, the ethanol production of the mutant strain SCF-R4 was 1.86 times that of the wild-type, indicating that with an increase in the number of irradiation rounds, the furfural tolerance of the mutant strain SCF-R4 was effectively enhanced. In addition, through genome-transcriptome analysis, potential sites related to furfural detoxification were identified, including GAL7, MAE1, PDC6, HXT1, AUS1, and TPK3. These results indicate that multiple rounds of progressive X-ray radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution is an effective mutagenic strategy for obtaining furfural-tolerant mutants and that it has the potential to tap genes related to the furfural detoxification mechanism.</description>

                Perovskite inorganic perovskite-type oxides are intriguing nanomaterials with numerous uses in electrochemical sensing, fuel cells, and catalysis. Because they are catalytic when employed as electrode modifiers, perovskites made at the nanoscale have recently attracted a lot of attention. These oxides have stronger catalytic activity than many compounds made of transition metals and even some oxides of precious metals. They display desirable physical and chemical properties like electronic conductivity, electrical activity, oxygen content variations, mobility of oxide ions through the crystal lattice, thermal and chemical stability, and super-magnetic, photocatalytic, thermoelectric, and dielectric properties. In oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution events, nano-perovskites have been used as catalysts because they have strong electrocatalytic activity, low activation energy, and strong electron transfer kinetics. Additionally, some perovskites provide good prospects for the production of efficient anodic catalysts with high catalytic performance for direct fuel cells. They can improve the performance of the catalytic process in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, exceptional long-term stability, good repeatability, and interference-fighting capacity.</description>

                Abstract Sufficient utilization of visible&#8208;light generated charge carriers in proton reduction reactions is of great significance for the development of effective solar&#8208;fuel technologies. Achieving simultaneous bulk rapid transfer and surface efficient extraction of charge carriers is still very challenging. Herein, it is found for the first time ammonium persulfate (APS) can significantly influence polymerization processes of C 3 N 4 (CN) from melamine to poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) under the simultaneous oxygen doping and etching effect of SO 4 2&#8722; . PHI with high crystallinity, porous structure, and in&#8208;situ oxygen doping was therefore obtained through one&#8208;step APS&#8208;assisted salt strategy. Benefiting from sufficient visible&#8208;light absorption and upshifted conduction band originating from regulated electronic structure and optimized morphology through APS modification, the as&#8208;prepared PHI achieved a H 2 evolution activity of 3274.23 &#956;mol h &#8722;1 g &#8722;1 ( &#955; &gt; 420 nm), which is appropriately 148 and 19 times that of conventional and crystalline CN. This work opens up new opportunities for efficient photocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Ion pickup by the solar wind is ubiquitous in space plasma. Because pickup ions are originally produced by ionization of an exospheric neutral atmosphere, their measurements contain information on the exospheric neutral abundance. Here we established a method to retrieve exospheric number densities, by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions of pickup ions measured by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft. We successfully retrieved exospheric oxygen density distributions at altitudes ranging from 1000 to 10,000 km around Mars except for the vicinity of the bow shock. This method can be applied to other space missions to study the upper atmosphere of planets, moons, and other small bodies in our solar system, where pickup ions exist.</description>

                Abstract Due to their unique properties, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are considered for diverse applications in microelectronics, sensing, catalysis, to name a few. A common challenge in 2D TMDC research is the film&#8217;s inherent instability i.e., spontaneous oxidation upon ambient exposure. The present study systematically explores the effect aging on the film composition and photoluminescent properties of monolayer WS2, synthetically grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The aging rate is investigated for different oxygen (i.e., O2 gas concentration and humidity) and light-controlled environments. Simple mitigation strategies that do not involve capping the 2D TMDC layer are discussed, and their effectiveness demonstrated by benchmarking the evolution in photoluminescence response against ambient exposed monolayer WS2. These results highlight the need to store 2D TMDCs in controlled environments to preserve the film quality and how future studies can account for the aging effect.</description>

                It is essential to diversity energy sources for ensuring sustainability. While hydrogen is considered a promising energy storage medium, its potential hinges on the development of efficient photocatalysts for green production. In addressing this challenge, we evaluated the performance of a heterojunction system composed of non-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides (MoO3-x) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots (QDs) for water splitting. MoO3-x were synthesized via gamma irradiation of the MoO3 in the presence of formic acid (FA), while CdS-MPA QDs were electrosynthesized. The heterojunction was formed through adsorption. The structural and electronic characterization revealed a progressive transformation from MoO3 to MoO3-x and MoO3-x/CdS-MPA QDs, demonstrating enhanced water-splitting performance. Upon evaluation, the study revealed a charge transfer mechanism, highlighting the significance of relative band positions between MoO3-x and CdS-MPA QDs in promoting eco-friendly hydrogen evolution and methanol processing. Thus, we suggest that the synergism between MoO3-x and CdS-MPA QDs semiconductors makes the heterojunction system a promising solution for photocatalytic production of hydrogen and oxygen.</description>

      <title>The Role of Oxidative Stress in Hypomagnetic Field Effects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox13081017</link>
      <description>Lanxiang Tian, Yukai Luo, Jie Ren, Chenchen Zhao, Antioxidants. 13(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401762803

                The geomagnetic field (GMF) is crucial for the survival and evolution of life on Earth. The weakening of the GMF, known as the hypomagnetic field (HMF), significantly affects various aspects of life on Earth. HMF has become a potential health risk for future deep space exploration. Oxidative stress is directly involved in the biological effects of HMF on animals or cells. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance favoring oxidants over antioxidants, resulting in cellular damage. Oxidative stress is a double-edged sword, depending on the degree of deviation from homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the important experimental findings from animal and cell studies on HMF exposure affecting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as the accompanying many physiological abnormalities, such as cognitive dysfunction, the imbalance of gut microbiota homeostasis, mood disorders, and osteoporosis. We discuss new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these HMF effects in the context of the signaling pathways related to ROS. Among them, mitochondria are considered to be the main organelles that respond to HMF-induced stress by regulating metabolism and ROS production in cells. In order to unravel the molecular mechanisms of HMF action, future studies need to consider the upstream and downstream pathways associated with ROS.</description>

      <title>Improving Healthcare Quality with a LHS: From Patient-Generated Health Data to Evidence-Based Recommendations</title>

                One approach to enriching the Learning Health System (LHS) is leveraging vital signs and data from wearable technologies. Blood oxygen, heart rate, respiration rates, and other data collected by wearables (like sleep and exercise patterns) can be used to monitor and predict health conditions. This data is already being collected and could be used to improve healthcare in several ways. Our approach will be health data interoperability with HL7 FHIR (for data exchange between different systems), openEHR (to store researchable data separated from software but connected to ontologies, external terminologies and code sets) and maintain the semantics of data. OpenEHR is a standard that has an important role in modelling processes and clinical decisions. The six pillars of Lifestyle Medicine can be a first attempt to change how patients see their daily decisions, affecting the mid to long-term evolution of their health. Our objective is to develop the first stage of the LHS based on a co-produced personal health recording (CoPHR) built on top of a local LLM that interoperates health data through HL7 FHIR, openEHR, OHDSI and terminologies that can ingest external evidence and produces clinical and personal decision support and, when combined with many other patients, can produce or confirm evidence.</description>

                Developing affordable and high&#8208;performance catalysts for water electrolyzers and fuel cell devices is an emerging field of research aiming for their feasible implementation and thus addressing sustainable global energy demands. Accordingly, several catalytic systems have been developed for anodic oxidation reactions and cathodic reduction reactions. Specifically, more research attention has been focused on viable catalyst synthesis processes including design, choice of precursors, reaction conditions, and regulation steps for achieving desirable properties and performances. Intriguingly, biomass has been demonstrated as a promising precursor for the potential design of different carbon&#8208;based catalysts for electrocatalytic oxidation/reduction reactions. In this review, the recent developments in using biomass precursors to derive different nanostructures are systematically discussed. The biomass&#8208;derived catalysts especially applied for reduction reactions (hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions) are summarized, and the impact of various catalysts&#8217; engineering routes (incorporation of metals and nonmetals into the carbon structures) on the resulting structure&#8211;performance relationship is critically discussed. Further, this review highlights the performance of various biomass&#8208;derived catalysts toward electrocatalytic reduction reactions that unveil the catalyst's intrinsic features such as selectivity, activity, and durability. The summarized results and the critical discussion will facilitate screening of the best biomass precursor, identifying suitable regulation strategies for accomplishing desirable properties, and thus advancing the next&#8208;generation catalysts&#8217; developments. Further, the significance, challenges, and perspectives on biomass&#8208;derived catalysts for electrocatalysis are comprehensively discussed.</description>

                Abstract Phase inversion involves in a complex process due to numerous factors affecting the membrane formation. Among them, polymer chain entanglement from polymeric membrane materials plays a critical role in regulating membrane structure and is still worth further exploration. Herein, a series of methacrylate copolymers with different contents of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) were designed and synthesized, and ultrafiltration membranes cast from these copolymers were systematically investigated regarding structural evolution and filtration performance. Surface zeta potential of membranes gradually transformed from positive to negative with the increasing PEGMA content due to nonsolvent-induced surface migration of element oxygen, and meanwhile the transformation from finger-like pore structure to sponge-like pore structure in the support layer was observed, which could be attributed to chain entanglement of the PEGMA-rich copolymer. Filtration experiments indicated that sponge-like membranes possessed better separation effect of Victoria blue B compared with finger-like membranes, and the optimized mPP40-15 % showed a retention rate of 99.55 % and permeance of 110.26 L m &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 bar &#8722;1 and displayed good selective separation of dye/salt mixture. Besides, sponge-like membranes also exhibited easy regeneration, anti-fouling property and filtration stability. This work will provide guidance for modulating membrane structure and offer an alternative material for membrane separation in handling dye wastewater.</description>

                Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools used in a wide range of scientific fields from planetary science to astronomy. We propose a future UV space telescope, LAPYUTA (Life-environmentology, Astronomy, and PlanetarY Ultraviolet Telescope Assembly), selected as a candidate for JAXA's 6th M-class mission in 2023. Launch is planned for the early 2030s. LAPYUTA will accomplish the following four objectives related to two scientific goals: understanding (1) the habitable environment and (2) the origin of structure and matter in the universe. Objective 1 focuses on the subsurface ocean environments of Jupiter's icy moons and the atmospheric evolution of terrestrial planets. Objective 2 characterizes the atmosphere of the exoplanets around the habitable zone and estimates their surface environment by detecting their exospheric atmosphere. In cosmology and astronomy, Objective 3 tests whether the structures of presentday galaxies contain ubiquitous Ly-&#945; halos and reveals the physical origins of Ly-&#945; halos. Objective 4 elucidates the synthesis process of heavy elements based on observations of ultraviolet radiation from hot gas immediately after neutronstar mergers. LAPYUTA will perform spectroscopic and imaging observations in the far-UV range of 110-190 nm with an effective area of &gt;300 cm2 and a high spatial resolution of 0.1 arcsec. The apogee is 2,000 km, and the perigee is 1,000 km to avoid the influence of the geocorona when observing oxygen and hydrogen atoms and the Earth's radiation belt.</description>

                SUMMARY 12&#8208;Oxo&#8208;phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) perform vital functions in plants. However, few studies have been reported in sugarcane ( Saccharum spp.), and it is of great significance to systematically investigates it in sugarcane. Here, 61 ShOPRs , 32 SsOPRs , and 36 SoOPRs were identified from R570 ( Saccharum spp. hybrid cultivar R570), AP85&#8208;441 ( Saccharum spontaneum ), and LA&#8208;purple ( Saccharum officinarum ), respectively. These OPRs were phylogenetically classified into four groups, with close genes similar structures. During evolution, OPR gene family was mainly expanded via whole&#8208;genome duplications/segmental events and predominantly underwent purifying selection, while sugarcane OPR genes may function differently in response to various stresses. Further, ScOPR2 , a tissue&#8208;specific OPR , which was localized in cytoplasm and cell membrane and actively response to salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate, and smut pathogen ( Sporisorium scitamineum ) stresses, was cloned from sugarcane. In addition, both its transient overexpression and stable overexpression enhanced the resistance of transgenic plants to pathogen infection, most probably through activating pathogen&#8208;associated molecular pattern/pattern&#8208;recognition receptor&#8208;triggered immunity, producing reactive oxygen species, and initiating mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase cascade. Subsequently, the transmission of SA and hypersensitive reaction were triggered, which stimulated the transcription of defense&#8208;related genes. These findings provide insights into the function of ScOPR2 gene for disease resistance.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Antioxidant-Ciprofloxacin Combinations on the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4756544/v1</link>

                Abstract Antibiotic resistance in biofilms is a critical challenge driven by mechanisms such as increased oxidative stress, which could lead to enhanced mutagenesis. Experimental evolution studies have shown that biofilm growth fosters antimicrobial resistance and tolerance. The bactericidal antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) exacerbates oxidative stress, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mutagenesis at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This study tests the hypothesis that antioxidants (AOs) such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), and Edaravone (ED) could serve as anti-evolutionary drugs to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa biofilms exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (CIP), with Thiourea (THU) used as a control. In vitro experimental evolution studies using the monitor strain PAO1-mCherry-PCD-gfp + were conducted in flow cells and glass beads biofilm models. The harvested biofilm populations underwent population analysis and the flow-cell populations were also whole genome sequenced (WGS). The results showed that the CIP-AO combination of CIP-THU could reduce the fast increase of mutagenic resistance in both biofilm models. The confocal laser microscopy of flow cells biofilms showed a reduction in the percentage of nfxB mutants in biofilms treated with all the three CIP-AO combinations compared to the CIP treatment alone following 24h of treatment. The population analysis revealed a significant reduction of the subpopulations growing on 0.5 mg/L of CIP-supplemented plates in all the combined treatments of CIP-AO as compared to CIP populations. The WGS results showed CIP-specific mutants in the CIP-treated populations including nfxB and nalC mutations which were not observed in CIP-AO-treated ones. Flagellar gene mutations appeared in CIP-ED (fliG) and CIP-NAC (flhA) treatments. Additionally, wspA, which regulates biofilm formation, had a transversion mutation in CIP-ED and a deletion mutation in CIP-NAC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) level for CIP-treated isolates was significantly higher than all isolates from CIP-AO treatments in both tested biofilm models of flow cells and glass beads. Overall, these findings suggest that the two clinical antioxidants may have a potential role in mitigating the development of antibiotic resistance in biofilms.</description>

                Background/Objectives: To analyze the best noninvasive tests prognosis marker in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) who underwent endovascular revascularization based on clinical outcomes, such as healing rate, time to heal, and free amputation survival after at least a six-month follow-up. Methods: A multicentric prospective observational study was performed with 28 participants with ischemic or neuroischemic DFU who came to the participant centers and underwent endovascular revascularization between January 2022 and March 2023. Toe systolic pressure (TP), ankle systolic pressure (AP), the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), the toe brachial pressure index (TBPI), transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), and skin perfusion pressure (SPP) were evaluated using PeriFlux 6000 System, Perimed, Sweden, before (Visit 0) and four weeks after revascularization (Visit 1). The primary clinical outcome was an evaluation of the clinical evolution of noninvasive tests comparing Visit 0 and Visit 1, estimating the sensitivity for predicting wound healing of noninvasive tests at six months following initial recruitment. Results: After six months, 71.43% (n = 20) of DFU healed, four patients (14.3%) received major amputations, and one (3.5%) died. The two tests that best predicted wound healing after revascularization according to the ROC curve were TcPO2 and TP with sensitivities of 0.89 and 0.70 for the cut-off points of 24 mmHg and 46 mmHg, respectively. Conclusions: TcPO2 and TP were the two tests that best predicted wound healing in patients who underwent endovascular revascularization. Clinicians should consider the importance of the evaluation of microcirculation in the healing prognosis of patients with diabetic foot ulcers.</description>

      <title>On the Solvent-mediated Stabilization of Phenol-formaldehyde Resole Resin- A Revisit</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36948/ijfmr.2024.v06i04.26342</link>

                The aging of phenol formaldehyde resole (PF) resin was monitored from an increase in viscosity, indirectly measured from its flow time though a capillary. A way to arrest the self-condensation reaction responsible for aging, is addition of a solvent so as to retards the kinetics of the crosslinking reaction. Conventionally, ethanol was used and is still preferred as the diluent for PF resin. However, no rationale has been given for this preference. On re-investigation, we too found that alcohols are the best diluents to arrest or retard aging of resoles. A detailed study of the evolution of viscosity with time for different alcoholic solution, concentrations and temperatures vis-&#224;-vis a reference solvent, Methyl, Ethyl Ketone (MEK) led to the conclusion that alcohol causes stabilisation of P-F resins by (i) sharing of the non-bonding electrons on the oxygen of alcohols with the electrophilic carbon of the H2C-OH groups of methylol, which quenches the latter&#8217;s reactivity towards another methylol phenol, (ii) the nucleophilicity of the OH group, (iii) the ease of proton transfer from the alcoholic -OH groups that facilitates the formation of benzyl alkyl ether with reduced reactivity towards phenols. The efficacy of the alcohol depends mainly on its nucleophilicity and steric environment. For these reasons, the stabilising effect of the alcohols decreased in the order tertiary&gt; primary &gt; secondary. Though the tertiary alcohols are the best, they are expensive and has, in general, a noxious ordure. The next choice falls on a primary alcohol that is sterically least hindered and has adequate nucleophilicity Though methanol appeared to be a good choice, its high volatility and toxicity impede its preference. The next choice is ethanol which is comparatively a strong nucleophile, is less toxic and volatile, easily available, low priced and is also an excellent solvent for P-F resin. Thus, the choice of ethanol as a preferred stabilising solvent for P-F resin is scientifically rationalized..</description>

The Special Issue (Forum) also serves as a reminder that gender equity is imperative for better science&#9472;and a better world.Before delving into the featured papers, our four women guest editors share their thoughts on the opportunities and challenges encountered by women researchers in nanoscience.Jacinta C. Conrad: I'm a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Houston and an executive editor for ACS Applied Nano Materials. I am interested in applications of complex fluids and soft materials, such as antifouling surfaces and diagnostics.Kaoru Tamada: I am from Kyushu University in Japan, and my research field is in nanomaterials and plasmonics. I'm very happy to join this project.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I am a physics professor at the University of Campinas in Brazil, and I'm really excited about the interface between nanomaterials and biological processes as well as finding out new tools to develop biomedical devices.A. Nirmala Grace: I am Professor and Director, Centre for Nanotechnology Research, VIT, India. I am currently focusing on development of advanced 2D based materials, specifically MXene, for energy storage and energy harvesting applications.Jacinta C. Conrad: My first question is what area or topic are you most excited about that is covered by the journal scope of ACS Applied Nano Materials?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I get excited when I see new applications of materials I have worked with a long time ago. Like quantum dots, which have been studied for many decades, but people still find new applications today. MOFs and nanoporous materials are also exciting due to so many applications. But in the journal, I end up handling a lot of research papers using a physics approach, and it is hard to choose among them what is most interesting.Kaoru Tamada: I am a fundamental research scientist, so I am very curious about applied materials research related to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), especially, research on materials fabrication for environmental applications.Jacinta C. Conrad: We are here to discuss the Special Issue on Women in Nano that we have put together. I wanted to ask a few questions about how being a woman has shaped your journey in this space. How do you think being a woman benefits or strengthens your research? And what strengths do you bring?Kaoru Tamada: I think this is may not be limited to the field of nanomaterials research, but women's different perspectives (from men) may generate new ideas even in research areas that have been established for many years. I get this feeling when I talked to scientists in other fields like the humanities or biomedical research (in Japan).M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Applied materials is interdisciplinary by nature, joining people from physics, chemistry, engineering, biology and more&#9472;even dental science! So, you must be able to talk to all these people and respect what they know. And I think that the ability to talk and connect with people is really strong among women. Maybe it seems stereotyping, but it is really related to how we behave in society. Women are usually more prone to go into social or applied sciences, searching for something that involves people. In my research experience, I feel this ability helped a lot as I was able to relate to many people in different fields and find connections that male colleagues working in my department could not do it as well even when they tried hard. They gave up very easily on effective communications.There is also a unique strength that women can bring to nanomaterials research, which comes from our daily life. As a woman PI, I also feel that I can better empathize and encourage my students to succeed in their work.A. Nirmala Grace: I feel women bring a unique edge to nanomaterials research. Imagine blending diverse educational paths and innovative problem-solving techniques&#9472;that is what women bring to the table. This mix is not just refreshing; it drives creativity and opens up new ways to approach research design and experiments. Women are stellar at working collaboratively, a must-have in the multidisciplinary world of nanotechnology. Their knack for fostering team spirit is not just a nice to have; it is a game changer, making research groups more cohesive and output more impactful. Women's meticulous attention to detail ensures that nothing minor gets overlooked&#9472;those small factors that can hugely sway our results.Lastly, we as women are resilient in STEM, and we are no strangers to challenges. Facing significant biases yet pressing on, they bring a determination to their research that raises the bar for rigor and innovation. So, we as women do not just participate in nanotechnology&#9472;they propel it forward with their unique strengths and perspectives.Jacinta C. Conrad: M&#244;nica and Nirmala brought out the importance of being able to work across disciplinary boundaries. Do you have examples of how you have worked across these boundaries in your research?Kaoru Tamada: I myself work in diverse fields of research, combining physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. We women with our communication skills can help in coordinating many scientists working in different fields. Communication is a very important practice because after all, science has been done by human beings.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: For me, talking to biologists was really a hard test. I have a very fruitful collaboration with a molecular biologist, over 10 years long. I recall that in the beginning it was really tough, as we had a lot of quarrels due to miscommunications. The way we look at science is different, and it is nice that both of us approach it by making compromises in the end. Biology has to deal with many complex variables simultaneously; they cannot take a horse and make into an ideal sphere, like a physicist would do. Unfortunately, such good collaboration experience does not happen all the time.Jacinta C. Conrad: Let us now talk about some of the challenges that you might have faced in your career, working in as a scientist in this discipline. Could you share some of the challenges that you faced in your career that are related to being a woman?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Being a woman physicist is tough as we are no more than 10&#8211;20% of the community. The biggest challenge for me was when I decided to move to materials science research during my Ph.D., decades ago. I had to listen to comments like "you do not do physics anymore" or "materials science is following recipes". They got me frustrated at first, but eventually my work helped me shrug these comments away. Materials science is a much more welcoming field for women. However, 20 plus years after that, my physics students still get similar comments from their colleagues, and that is very disappointing.Jacinta C. Conrad: As a physicist, one of the reasons why I love the space of materials, broadly, is because that community has a different outlook on inclusion and making people feel welcome in the field.Kaoru Tamada: For my cases, all the fields of scientific research in Japan are not easy for women in general. However, compared to the traditional field like physics with a longer history, nanomaterials is a relatively new field, so it is easier for women to be integrated there. A relatively large number of Japanese women scientists work in this field compared to other more conventional branches of chemistry.A. Nirmala Grace: One big hurdle I've faced in the realm of nanomaterials research is this deep-seated bias that is pretty common across many scientific fields. It seems like women often get less access to the crucial things we need to thrive&#9472;like funding, mentorship, and chances to network. These gaps usually come from old-school practices and cultural norms that, maybe without meaning to, tilt the scales in favor of male researchers. It is also tough because we women are not as visible in STEM, especially in the higher ranks and in niche areas like nanotechnology. This scarcity of female presence can start a tough cycle where upcoming female scientists struggle to find mentors they can relate to or even see as role models.Then, there's the sheer demand of research work, which can really clash with personal life, and often, that burden falls more heavily on women. The usual academic setups do not really bend to accommodate flexible schedules, which makes juggling a science career and family life all the more challenging. Plus, there are these lingering stereotypes about gender roles that can skew the vibe at work, sometimes leaving women with less support or expectations that just are not as high as they might be for men.Jacinta C. Conrad: One of the ideas that you have collectively brought forward is that this is a new field and that it is easier for women to work in it. Is there something about nanomaterials or applied nanomaterials that might be particularly appealing to women?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I think that women are naturally more interested in the applied aspects of scientific research, especially applications that are related to social issues. For example, in our undergrad school, the percentage of women in medical physics is larger than for fundamental physics. Many research papers show that young women eventually get away from hard science, if it is not shown as diverse and inclusive and relatable to common needs. Materials science is appealing since it is at the base of technological development in our society, and women realize very quickly that it can benefit mankind in a very important way.Kaoru Tamada: In Japan, faculty positions in the universities in the traditional fields tend to be already filled mostly by men. Therefore, there is very little chance to join those fields and to get major funding for women. However, in the case of nanomaterials research, there is more space open for new people, especially female and young researchers, so in the end, Japanese female nanoscientists had more chance to get exposed in the field and to be a representative in the field.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: The world right now is polarized, and progressive people question gender roles and stereotypes. To be honest, my family does not know much of what I do, and I gave up explaining my career to them. I just do not fit into any stereotype they feel more comfortable with. So even within inner circles, we are challenged every day for the kind of work we do, particularly for women in Latin America. Therefore, finding partnership and inclusion among colleagues in materials science is really great!Jacinta C. Conrad: Of course, in the US right now there are real challenges related to efforts to include members of groups that have been historically underrepresented or excluded. Because science is global, being aware of the different cultural aspects is also important for understanding how to grow a field. The last question I have is, what changes would you suggest or would need to happen to improve the climate, to continue to make this field of applied nanomaterials and this discipline of materials science a good place for women and other groups to work in? How can we better these fields?Kaoru Tamada: I'm a university vice president responsible for diversity, equity, and inclusion, so my opinion is very generalized to that perspective, not specific to chemistry or physics. In order to promote the active participation of women, I believe it is extremely important to create a climate where women are accepted, welcomed, and feel free to speak out. I think that women can fully engage in scientific research nowadays, and women are not a minority in science anymore. In fact, 50% of humanity is women, so women are not a minority to begin with. However, if women have been treated as a minority throughout history, women should not just wait for someone to create an environment for them, but rather actively participate and create a system that is comfortable for them.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Women are a minoritized majority. We are usually the majority in population but the minority in terms of rights and respect. The main problem with women is in society in general. So, we need to create a culture of inclusion just like Kaoru said, by moving forward diversity and equity policies which can change culture in the long term. But first of all, we need to "remind ourselves" of gender issues in our daily life, to fight against microaggressions and build up representation, occupying spaces in which we are not usually present. In particular, nanoscience research strongly demonstrates how diversity provides a more welcoming environment, which in turn makes the field advance much faster.A. Nirmala Grace: I feel many research environments just are not built with everyone's needs in mind, and that can really throw off work&#8211;life balance and overall job satisfaction, especially for women. Imagine how much more inviting workplaces could be if they offered flexible working hours, solid support for parental leave, and child care solutions. These changes could make a huge difference in making everyone feel welcome. Now, when it comes to research funding, there's a noticeable lean toward projects led by men. This imbalance limits the resources that could flow into women-led research. We need funding bodies to step up, make their processes crystal clear, and maybe even earmark some funds specifically for projects led by women or other historically excluded groups; though there are some specific projects existing now, these need to be increased.Recognition is another big area. Women's contributions in nanotechnology, like in many fields, often do not get the spotlight they deserve. Institutions could really help change the narrative by actively celebrating these achievements with awards and public acknowledgments. This not only boosts the profile of women scientists but also lights up the path for the next generation. Networking is crucial too. Women sometimes face extra hurdles here, both internal and external. Boosting support for women-specific professional networks can open a lot of doors, and ensuring that conferences and symposiums strive for gender balance in speakers and attendees would also level the playing field. By tackling these issues, we can create a more equal and dynamic environment in nanotechnology research.Jacinta C. Conrad: I will add that finding support is crucial for women researchers. That includes financial support, to ensure that women and other people can pursue questions that are of interest to them and that may be beneficial to society. I think that we can all agree with the need to continue to fund these activities.Kaoru Tamada: I am proud of this "Women in Nano" Special Issue because we are providing exposure to high quality research activities done by women scientists. Many talented women researchers are willing to present their latest results in this Special Issue, which means that they are very positive to take this kind of action in our nanomaterials society&#9472;that is a great thing for the future of our society. We hope this Special Issue will deliver our message that women's participation in science is invaluable.Jacinta C. Conrad: I'm also excited that this Special Issue includes contributions from women at all stages in their research careers and from at least 16 countries. Both are shifts toward greater inclusion.Our Special Issue (Forum) also collected several author responses to the question: "What strengths do you bring to nanomaterials research as a woman, and what challenges have you encountered in this discipline?"Dr. Afriyanti Sumboja, Associate Professor, Indonesia: Women can bring a unique perspective to nanomaterials research by emphasizing collaborative approaches. Especially, women's ability to empathize and communicate effectively across diverse teams can foster strong teamwork, leading to innovative solutions and better outcomes in scientific research. Moreover, most female scientists have experienced navigating challenges in a male-dominated environment, which honed their resilience and determination, qualities that are invaluable in pushing the boundaries in nanomaterials research.Dr. Roya Majidi, Associate Professor, Iran: I consider myself fortunate that my family, professors, and colleagues have provided me with equal opportunities for education and research as a woman. However, I have encountered the challenge of society's perception that women, due to family responsibilities, physical conditions, and emotional sensitivities, may not be able to consistently and deeply commit themselves to scientific research. Consequently, I have consistently exerted greater effort than men to demonstrate my abilities and achieve similar professional and research opportunities. I am delighted that now, as a university professor specializing in nanophysics, I have the opportunity to inspire the next generation of female scientists in my country to pursue their passions. I strive to show them that their aspirations are indeed within reach.Dr. Celia Machado Ronconi, Professor, Brazil: In nanomaterials research, my strengths include a solid educational background, creativity in developing new materials with innovative properties, and curiosity about material properties at the nanoscale. However, challenges arise from the field's male dominance, which limits opportunities for women and leads to frequent over-scrutiny. This environment demands technical expertise, resilience, and assertiveness from women to succeed.Dr. Manasa Nune, Associate Professor, India: As a woman I feel proud to be in the STEM field especially the area of nanomaterials which gives me an opportunity to work in the areas which have tremendous potential to be brought into the translation from lab to market. I can foresee that I could contribute to the societal development especially for the healthcare sector. I did face a few challenges in the field initially with respect to gender specific prejudices, work&#8211;life balance, etc. but could overcome them gradually, and I attribute it to the wonderful mentors that I had in my research as well as life journey which include both men and women.Isabela da Costa Tonon, Ph.D. student at University of Campinas, works on 2D materials: As a woman, I believe that throughout our lives we are required to have the ability to adapt and perceive the particularities of situations and places very quickly and dynamically, to think and act. In the academic context, this often allowed me a broader perspective to think about and attack scientific problems in the nanomaterials area. Working with mostly male researchers in the field also allows me to reflect on other perspectives and compare my own opinions to make suggestions. At the same time, I feel a little lonely and questioning my future opportunities. Will I have the same opportunities as others? Does this (gender) matter or is it your network that will open doors? Is my niche the best career path, not just academically, but in life? Who do I talk to about these things if my male colleagues often don't share my questions. I can debate them to some extent, but I know it wouldn't be the same as talking to another woman in the nanomaterials area.Patricia Duarte de Almeida, Ph.D. student at University of Campinas, works on nanocomposites for sensors: I believe that, as a woman who has worked in other areas of physics, I can adapt more quickly to changes. I have learned to seek change to achieve better results, to move through frustration rather than remaining stagnant because of it. As for the challenges, one that I encountered was communicating my ideas and being understood by someone outside my area. It's easy to stay in a comfort zone and assume that everyone will understand what you are saying, rather than adapting your language to communicate with everyone. However, it is very important that we do this.Dr. Ayumi Hirano-Iwata, Professor, Japan: In Japan, women scientists face challenges in securing academic positions and promotions. It is not unusual for them to switch research fields in order to obtain a position. I started my career as a graduate student in chemistry, then worked as a postdoctoral fellow in biology, and now I am a professor of physics (electronics). I also teach mathematics in my classes. As a result, I have gained experience in a variety of scientific fields. In the relatively new field of nanomaterials research, I find it beneficial to draw on my diverse research background, which has become a source of originality in my work.Part 2: Highlights of Featured PapersClick to copy section linkSection link copied!As the guest editors of this Forum (Special Issue) on Women in Nano, we are delighted to present 50 papers resulting from the work of women in applied nanomaterials. Our Forum (Special Issue) features articles authored by women from at least 16 countries across career stages from graduate students to professors and practicing scientists. The articles in this Special Issue (Forum) feature applications addressing the most urgent challenges currently faced by their societies:Energy generation and storage. The transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean, abundant, and sustainable energy requires technologies to generate and store energy from renewable sources. Zhang et al. describe an approach to increase the efficiency of photovoltaics (10.1021/acsanm.3c01653). The studies by Mishra et al., Mohan et al., Gangavarapu et al., Maheshwari et al., and Kim et al. advance the development of supercapacitors for energy storage (10.1021/acsanm.3c01897, 10.1021/acsanm.3c05803, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04101, 10.1021/acsanm.4c01697, 10.1021/acsanm.4c02216), and Sahoo et al. report technologies for anodes in energy storage devices (10.1021/acsanm.3c05066). Apparla et al. briefly review the use of carbon nanomaterials in metal-ion hybrid capacitors (10.1021/acsanm.4c01889).Chemical and fuel production. Cali et al. and Velio&#287;lu et al. use nanomaterials in critical chemical process applications (10.1021/acsanm.3c04126, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03526). Replacing hydrogen produced from fossil fuel sources with that produced using renewable energy is also an essential part of the transition away from fossil fuels. Basu et al., Pal et al., Pan et al., Preethi V et al., and Sumboja et al. employ nanomaterials to produce hydrogen through water splitting, including the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acsanm.3c03203, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02870, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02909, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04129, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02092), and Sharma et al. review advances in nanotextured surfaces for water splitting (10.1021/acsanm.3c04083).Clean water. Ensuring access to clean water requires innovative technologies to detect and remove contaminants as well as harvest water from unconventional sources. Jost et al. and Sai et al. use nanomaterials to improve detection of contaminants, including metal ions as well as agricultural contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c05627, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04104). The papers by Badhulika et al. and Lee et al. describe strategies to degrade contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c02070, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03622), and Noah reviews the state of nanoparticle-laden membranes for water purification (10.1021/acsanm.3c04110). Finally, Neeroli Kizhakayil et al. report a method to harvest water from the atmosphere (10.1021/acsanm.4c00110).Human health. Early detection is an effective strategy for combating disease. The papers by Bonnani et al., Lee et al., and Parihar and Khan describe nanomaterial-enabled advances in methods to detect metabolites and biomarkers (10.1021/acsanm.3c06157, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03650, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03234), and Liu reports nanowire-based electrodes for health monitoring (10.1021/acsanm.3c03457). The small size and ready functionalization of nanoparticles makes them attractive as carriers for theranostics. Innovative nanocarrier-based delivery systems from Papadakis et al., Ronconi et al., Tanner et al., Wang et al., and Yao et al. along with Pellegrino et al.'s study of the interactions of nanoparticles with cell membranes highlight the opportunities of nanomedicine for treating conditions from sepsis to cancer and the challenges that must be overcome for effective delivery (10.1021/acsanm.3c03826, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04519, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03807, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03592, 10.1021/acsanm.4c02015, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04107).Agricultural monitoring. Nanomaterial-based sensors offer opportunities to improve outcomes in agriculture. The contributions from Martsinovich et al. and Thangamuthu et al., respectively, report sensors for soil health and soil contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c04147, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03148).Electronic devices. Experimental studies from Arora et al., Hirano-Iwata et al., and Khaustov et al. as well as computational studies from Majidi and Chen et al. describe applications in nanomaterials for optoelectronic devices to detect and control light (10.1021/acsanm.3c03151, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04080, 10.1021/acsanm.3c01314, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03264, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03764). Mi&#353;eikis et al. present a new design for a Hall sensor, which is used to detect speed or position (10.1021/acsanm.3c03920), and Au and Shehayeb review the use of nanoporous organic frameworks in light-emitting diodes (10.1021/acsanm.3c05190).Advanced materials. Novel applications are enabled by developments in the design, synthesis, and characterization of nanoscale structures and assemblies. Reviews by Moores and Catingan, Seabra et al., and Spangler and Vigil highlight advances in different areas of nanomaterials design (10.1021/acsanm.3c04756, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03482, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04277). Nune et al., Pantano et al., and Watanabe et al. investigate the processing of nanoparticle-based materials for applications in 3-D bioprinting, functional composites, and smart films (10.1021/acsanm.3c02962, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02946, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03940). Hamad-Schifferli et al. use paperfluidic devices to synthesize nanoparticles and chemicals (10.1021/acsanm.4c01669). Lee et al. report a new method for nanoscale imaging (10.1021/acsanm.3c04361). Finally, Ahmed et al. introduce a field-driven nanorobotic system (10.1021/acsanm.3c04143).While the focus of this Special Issue (Forum) is on applications enabled through advances in nanomaterials, we also wish to emphasize the common scientific themes that will continue to drive forward the innovative use of materials in these spaces:Role of dimensionality. From 0-D quantum dots to 1-D nanotubes to 2-D thin films and nanosheets to 3-D nanoparticles, nanoscale dimensions impart properties that are not found in bulk materials. Applications in nanomaterials will continue to benefit from the development of synthetic routes to control dimension across a wide range of chemistries.Interactions with ions and molecules: Many of the achievements highlighted in this Special Issue (Forum) are enabled by specific interactions of ions or molecules with nanoscale materials. Further advances in methods to characterize and tailor these interactions are essential for advancing applications from the ultrasensitive detection of analytes to catalytic production of fuels and chemicals.Self- and directed assembly: The organization from the nanoscale to microscale to mesoscale determines the function of hierarchically structured materials. Scalable routes to generate complex multiscale structures, whether driven by self-assembly or by application of fields, will continue to inspire novel functional applications.We thank all the authors for their contributions to this Special Issue (Forum) focused on the achievements of women in applied nanomaterials.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJacinta C.

By focusing on this era, characterized by robust urban growth, we leverage a wealth of archaeological evidence. Our approach embraces a systemic perspective, interpreting cities, their supporting landscapes, and the associated societies as an intricately interconnected socioecological system. Through case studies spanning diverse regions of the Roman Empire, we bring this systemic narrative to life, offering insights into the existing literature. Our findings reveal that the environmental impacts of the prevailing socioecological systems were extensive and enduring. However, these effects were partially counteracted by the limited availability of extractable resources and energy, as well as human ingenuity. REFERENCES Aguilera , M. , V. Zech-Matterne , S.
