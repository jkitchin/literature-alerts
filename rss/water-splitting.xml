      <title>Enhancing Fenton-like Photo-degradation and Electrocatalytic Oxygen
  Evolution Reaction (OER) in Fe-doped Copper Oxide (CuO) Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.05637</link>
      <description>Suresh Chandra Baral, Dilip Sasmal, Sayak Datta, Mange Ram, Krishna Kanta Haldar, Ahmed Mekki, Somaditya Sen, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405253610

                Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of &gt;10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.</description>

      <title>Halting Oxygen Evolution to Achieve Long Cycle Life in Sodium Layered Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202418605</link>
      <description>Haoji Wang, Jinqiang Gao, Yu Mei, Lianshan Ni, Yi He, Ningyun Hong, Jiangnan Huang, Wentao Deng, Guoqiang Zou, Hongshuai Hou, Chaoping Liang, Tongchao Liu, Xiaobo Ji, Khalil Amine, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405259193

                Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high-energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi-concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P-O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, we reveal that a high-entropy state induced by cationic disordering has capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental P3' phases. As a consequence, the high-voltage cycling stability has been greatly enhanced, up to 4.4 V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles and 76.1% capacity retention at 2C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high-energy, long-cycling, safe batteries.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Degradation by Anion Redox in LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Countered via Pillaring</title>

      <description>Matthew Bergschneider, Fantai Kong, Patrick Conlin, Taesoon Hwang, Seok&#8208;Gwang Doo, Kyeongjae Cho, Advanced Energy Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405260966

                Abstract A promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy cathode material, LiNiO 2 (LNO) has failed to realize commercialization due to severe capacity degradation during cycling. The dual mechanisms of surface oxygen evolution due to anion redox and anisotropic volume change upon delithiation synergistically pulverize and degrade the material. Detailed Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling and analysis of the anisotropic structural changes associated with crack formation in LiNiO 2 (LNO) reveals the link of mechanical behavior to charge transfer and oxygen redox activity upon deep charge cycling (&gt;4.2 V vs Li/Li + ). In the two&#8208;phase region and H2&#8211;H3 transition from 66% to 100% delithiation, oxygen of [NiO 6 ] octahedra is discovered to undergo redox in growing the Li&#8208;deficient regions, causing c&#8208;lattice mechanical weakening and collapse as the Li&#8208;slab becomes depleted. Li&#8208;site dopants are investigated to locally compensate against anion redox, resulting in enhanced coulombic repulsion and supporting the interslab layer thickness even at 100% depth of charge. Ionic size and oxidation state of M in Li x&#8208;y M y NiO 2 are found to fundamentally impact stabilization capability, moderating the anisotropic strain and volume expansion asynchronously. Optimization of mixed doping composition may then enable &#8220;zero strain&#8221; high&#8208;Ni Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O 2 (NCM) or LNO.</description>

      <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202402951</link>
      <description>Lei Zhu, Xiao&#8208;Jing Sang, Peng Zhao, Jiansheng Li, Sifan Li, Hao Dong, Xin Zhou, Meiying Liu, Wan&#8208;Sheng You, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405261426

                The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver-based electrocatalysts (Ag-x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver-based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag-10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm-2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag-10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (-111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag-O-O-Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.</description>

      <title>Assembly and Valence Modulation of Ordered Bimetallic MOFs for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29245845</link>
      <description>Yaling Wu, Zhaopeng Sun, Yingying Chen, Dan Liu, Yan Meng, Yan Zheng, Molecules. 29(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405284174

                Metal synergy can enhance the catalytic performance, and a prefabricated solid precursor can guide the ordered embedding, of secondary metal source ions for the rapid synthesis of bimetallic organic frameworks (MM&#8217;-MOFs) with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. In this paper, Co-MOF-1D containing well-defined binding sites was synthesized by mechanical ball milling, which was used as a template for the induced introduction of Fe ions to successfully assemble the ordered bimetallic Co1Fe1-MOF-74@2 (where @2 denotes template-directed synthesis of MOF-74). Its electrocatalytic performance is superior to that of the conventional one-step-synthesized Co1Fe1-MOF-74@1 (where @1 denotes one-step synthesis of MOF-74), and the ratio of the two metal sources, Co and Fe, is close to 1:1. Meanwhile, the iron valence states (FeII and FeIII) in Co1Fe1-MOF-74@2 were further regulated to obtain the electrocatalytic materials Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2 and Co1Fe1(III)-MOF-74@2. The electrochemical performance test results confirm that Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2 regulated by valence state has a better catalytic performance than Co1Fe1(III)-MOF-74@2 in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. This phenomenon is related to the gradual increase in the valence state of Fe ions in Co1Fe1(II)-MOF-74@2, which promotes the continuous improvement in the performance of the MOF before reaching the optimal steady state and makes the OER performance reach the optimum when the FeII/FeIII mixed-valence state reaches a certain proportion. This provides a new idea for the directed synthesis and optimization of highly efficient catalysts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction of network structured Polypyrrole-NaBiO2 nanocomposite in alkaline media</title>

                When it comes to the ability of the water splitting process to create hydrogen, the challenging dynamics of the water-oxidation reaction (WOR) provide a substantial impediment. So, in order to start both hydrogen and oxygen production during water electrolysis, efficient catalysts are needed. Herein, we report the development of NaBiO2@PPy nanocomposite capable of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in alkaline medium. The fabricated NaBiO2@PPy nanocomposite and its individuals are characterized via various techniques to confirm the structural, elemental, textural, and morphological characteristics. This material produces a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for oxygen evolution comparatively at low overpotentials of 227 mV and maintains its stability for up to 50 h. Furthermore, the fabricated NaBiO2@PPy nanocomposite also shows less Tafel slope of 30.8 mV/dec. Therefore, this catalytic material would be a good option for creating a cost-effective, and environmentally friendly alkaline medium. In order to enhance the performance of water electrolysis, this work offers a revolutionary designed material and electrode fabrication method for future applications. The NaBiO2@PPy nanocomposite is produced by a simple hydrothermal technique. The presence of Polypyrrole (PPy) improves the conductivity of the electrocatalyst by fast ion transmission rate. The NaBiO2@PPy nanocomposite displays an overpotential of 227 mV with a Tafel slope of 30.8 mV/dec at 10 mA/cm2. The NaBiO2@PPy displays excellent activity and stability of 50 h toward OER.</description>

                Plasma as a promising solution to catalyst synthesis and modification has received great attention in the field of electrochemical water splitting. However, a comprehensive overview detailing how plasma treatments of catalysts enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is currently lacking. Here, we review the advances and challenges in cold plasma for catalyst preparation and modification. We discuss the underlying mechanisms responsible for enhanced OER performance on plasma-treated catalysts, where the surface area, active sites, vacancy type/content, heteroatom doping, etching, and surface functionalization could be mediated. This review aims to provide valuable insights into the role of plasma treatments in advancing OER electrocatalysis for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Restructuring of Asymmetric Built&#8208;in Electric Field Catalysts Facilitates the Efficient Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction play an important role in realizing hydrogen economy. In this study, the multi&#8208;heterogeneous interfacial catalyst, Ni 2 P@FeP@Co 2 P (denoted as NFC), with an asymmetric built&#8208;in electric field is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the double charge balance effect, NFC exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity. Importantly, the NFC&#8208;assembled anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer exhibits enhanced performance and remarkable stability at industrial current densities and high temperatures, reaching a current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 at the small voltage of 1.95 V. The results of the dynamic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests indicate that the self&#8208;reconfiguration of the NFC during OER provides additional active sites for the reaction. The density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the asymmetric built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) induces an adaptive distribution of charge, which optimizes the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen/oxygen intermediates during the reaction, thereby enhancing the catalytic kinetics of the overall water splitting process.

                This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the development, working principles, and catalyst evaluation parameters in the realm of electrochemical water electrolysis, with a primary focus on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). The discussion encompasses the historical perspective, reaction mechanisms, and fundamental principles underlying water electrolysis, with a strong emphasis on the pivotal role of electrocatalysts in driving efficient hydrogen production. Furthermore, this paper delves into a specific study that involves the fabrication of 3D hierarchical NiFeP/CoP nano-arrays on conductive carbon cloth. This innovative catalyst architecture, realized through a combination of hydrothermal methods and phosphating treatments, showcases remarkable performance in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. The hierarchical structure of this catalyst maximizes the electrochemically active area, exposing a higher number of active sites and facilitating efficient reaction kinetics. The catalytic performance of NiFeP/CoP/CC is distinguished by its low overpotentials, a small Tafel slope, and exceptional stability over prolonged durations. This promising performance positions it as a potential substitute for precious metal catalysts in the pursuit of sustainable energy conversion. In essence, this research significantly contributes to the ongoing endeavor to discover cost-effective, resource-efficient, and highly active electrocatalysts. It marks a notable step forward in the journey towards achieving green energy transformation, aligning with the imperative for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy solutions.</description>

                Abstract Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) possess tunable electronic structures and efficient atom utilization, making them highly promising for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). However, achieving high catalytic activity and stability for both ORR and OER in DACs remains a challenge. Herein, a flexible membrane of porous carbon fiber anchored with atomically scattered CoN 4 /FeN 4 dual sites and adjacent Co 2 Fe 2 /Fe 5 nanoclusters (Co, Fe&#8208;DACs/NCs@PCF) is synthesized. The local geometry and electronic structure of the CoN 4 /FeN 4 sites, which act as reaction centers for ORR/OER, are finely regulated by the neighboring Co 2 Fe 2 /Fe 5 nanoclusters. This unique structure imparts Co, Fe&#8208;DACs/NCs@PCF with exceptional activity and durability toward ORR/OER, outperforming the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts containing only CoN 4 or FeN 4 sites, as well as commercial Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air battery employing a Co, Fe&#8208;DACs/NCs@PCF cathode exhibits outstanding stability, maintaining cyclability for over 1500 h, outperforming a Pt/C + RuO 2 air cathode. Theoretical calculations highlight distinct synergies between Fe 5 (Co 2 Fe 2 ) clusters and FeN 4 (CoN 4 ) sites, which optimize the coupling strength of Fe(Co)&#9472;OH at the potential&#8208;determining steps and thus improve ORR (OER) catalytic kinetics. This study lays a theoretical and practical foundation for rational design of heterostructure catalysts featuring coexisting DACs and nanoclusters within porous carbon fibers.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical water splitting represents a highly promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion and storage, paving the way for a future hydrogen-based society. This approach necessitates the development of durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts for the OER. In this study, we report the as-synthesized NiFe-based high-entropy compound grown on nickel foam via direct electrochemical deposition. Remarkably, electrodeposition onto 1&#215;1 cm2 nickel foam was optimized by strategically varying critical parameters. Subsequently, the fabricated electrodes underwent evaluation for comprehensive water splitting within the identical flow cell under alkaline conditions. The best-performing sample, NiFe-2:1, required relatively low overpotentials of 232 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the OER. The NiFe-2:1 hydroxides exhibit high entropy, which optimizes the flat-band potential (Efb) and carrier concentration (NA) in high-entropy NiFe-based electrocatalysts. This enhancement facilitates sensitive electron transfer, thereby reducing the kinetic barrier for the OER. Furthermore, this review thoroughly discusses potential degradation mechanisms of active sites and outlines corresponding mitigation strategies. It also offers insights into the discrepancies between research and the design of non-precious metal-based catalysts for the OER, as well as their implementation in practical devices.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stands as a pivotal electrochemical process, playing a crucial role in various cutting-edge renewable energy technologies such as water-splitting and metal-air batteries. However, its inherent sluggish kinetics necessitate a substantial overpotential to drive the OER, which significantly constrains the widespread application of these devices. Consequently, a range of efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts, including carbon-based materials, metals, and metallic compounds, have been engineered to reduce the OER overpotential and enhance energy efficiency. In this section, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the recent intriguing advancements in metallic compounds for the OER, with a deep exploration of the catalytic mechanisms and the underlying structure&#8211;performance relationships. Specifically, we systematically delve into metal oxides, hydroxides, and their supported single-atom/nanoparticle materials, showcasing their superiority in driving the OER. Finally, we offer some new insights into the remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of metallic compounds.</description>

                Porous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), possess distinctive porous structural characteristics such as exceptional porosity, large surface areas, and well-organized nanoporous structures. These materials can be designed with specific structures and compositions to enhance their applications in gas capture, separation, catalysis, energy storage, and conversion. Recently, the development of pure MOFs/COFs along with their derivatives has paved the way for the creation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). This chapter discusses recent progress in the synthesis and the electrocatalytic applications of MOF/COF-based electrocatalysts toward OER, including pristine MOFs/COFs, MOFs/COFs composites, and derivatives. The primary section focuses on the advancements in the design and preparation of various MOF/COF-based catalysts such as metal nodes and organic ligand engineering, conductive substrates and active species composites, and metals into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. Furthermore, the current challenges and outlook of MOFs/COFs-based OER electrocatalysts are also presented.</description>

                Electrocatalysis holds paramount significance in driving the progress of sustainable energy technologies, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and batteries. The presence of various species on the electrode surface, such as reactants, intermediates, and products during electrocatalysis' usually gives rise to complex reaction pathways. A systematic understanding of various electrocatalytic processes in chemical reactions is required to untangle the complicated interaction of species on the catalyst's surface and their influence on the electrocatalytic process. Taking hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as examples, this chapter introduces electrocatalytic mechanisms, feasible reaction pathways, and fundamental concepts to readers and stimulates their interest in the various fields of electrocatalysts and their applications.</description>

                Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their high surface area, tunable pore structures, and abundant active sites. Ligand engineering is an important strategy to optimize their performance. Here, we report the synthesis of NiFe&#8208;MOFs based on three different ligands: 1,4&#8208;terephthalic acid (BDC), 2,4&#8208;thiophene dicarboxylic acid (TDC), and 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDC), to investigate the effects of heteroatom&#8208;based aromatic rings on OER performance. It is revealed that by incorporating electronegative sulfur and oxygen atoms into the ligands, the electron density at the metal sites is reduced, leading to enhanced metal&#8208;oxygen covalency and improved charge transfer kinetics. The NiFe&#8208;FDC/NF catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and stable performance over 1300 hours at 1 A&#183;cm&#8208;2. In situ infrared spectroscopy reveal minimal structural reconstruction in NiFe&#8208;FDC/NF, contributing to its superior stability. The NiFe&#8208;FDC/NF were then subjected to 3600 hours of OER operation and it&#8217;s metal elution was monitored. These findings offer a novel approach to ligand design for high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, highlighting the potential of furan&#8208;based ligands for MOF ligand engineering.</description>

                Sustainable energy societies demand rechargeable batteries using ubiquitous-material electrodes of geopolitical-risk-free elements. We aim to develop low-overpotential oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) catalysts that suppress carbon corrosion of gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to realize two-electrode rechargeable Zn-air batteries (r-ZABs). Herein, single-walled-carbon-nanotube (SWNT) thin films are used as a scaffold for a benchmark OER catalyst, doping-free NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFeLDHs), operating in r-ZABs using alkali aqueous electrolytes. Metal compositions of NiFeLDHs are controlled with an atomic-level quality using Prussian-blue-analog nanoparticles of Ni</description>

      <title>Perchlorate Fusion&#8211;Hydrothermal Synthesis of Nano-Crystalline IrO2: Leveraging Stability and Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-31vk9</link>

                Iridium oxides are the leading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, improving iridium utilization is crucial due to its high cost and scarcity. Crystalline rutile-type iridium dioxide (IrO2) offers superior stability in acidic OER conditions compared to amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx), but the high synthesis temperatures required for crystalline phase formation reduce OER activity by decreasing active surface area. Herein, we present a novel perchlorate fusion&#8211;hydrothermal (PFHT) synthesis method to produce nano-crystalline rutile-type IrO2 nanoparticles with exceptional OER performance. This low-temperature approach involves calcination 300 &#176;C in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent, sodium perchlorate, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 &#176;C, yielding ~2 nm IrO2 nanoparticles. The catalyst achieved a high mass-specific OER activity of 95 A gIr&#8211;1 at 1.525 VRHE in ex situ glass-cell testing. Notably, the PFHT-synthesized IrO2 demonstrated remarkable stability under harsh accelerated stress test conditions, outperforming commercial catalysts. The exceptional activity of the catalyst was confirmed with in situ PEMWE single-cell evaluations. This demonstrates that the PFHT synthesis method leverages the superior intrinsic properties of nano-crystalline IrO2, effectively overcoming the typical trade-offs between OER activity and catalyst stability, making it a promising approach for advancing PEMWE technologies.</description>

                Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8208;N6 and Ni&#8208;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8208;N6 or Ni&#8208;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8208;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8208;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.</description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanism Investigation of Hematite Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: Progress of In Situ and Operando Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c06448</link>
      <description>Yiping Zhao, Guang-Ping Yi, Yong&#8208;Min Liang, Tiger H. Tao, Pengyi Tang, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405428911

                Hematite photoanodes, a promising candidate for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, are far from reaching their theoretical photocurrent limit. Further designing high-performance hematite-based photoanodes requires an in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of PEC water splitting. In situ and operando spectral characterizations facilitate the mechanism investigation, revealing the dynamic surface structures and intermediates of hematite photoanodes during the PEC water splitting process. Herein, in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques were applied for a mechanistic understanding of hematite-based photoanodes in the PEC water splitting system, such as UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The recent progress on charge carrier dynamics and interfacial reaction intermediates of hematite photoanodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is summarized. An outlook on challenges and prospects of in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques for PEC water splitting is given. This review will inspire future mechanism investigation of photoanodes for PEC water splitting to achieve higher performance.</description>

      <title>Triggering Oxygen Redox Cycles in Nickel Ferrite by Octahedral Geometry Engineering for Enhancing Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202409024</link>

                Abstract Spinel&#8208;type nickel ferrite (Ni x Fe 3&#8208;x O 4 , x&#8804;1) is a widely used electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the lower hybridization of metal&#8208; d and oxygen&#8208; p orbitals, the OER process on Ni x Fe 3&#8208;x O 4 follows the sluggish adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Generally, activating the lattice oxygen to trigger the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) can enhance the OER activity. Herein, to trigger the LOM pathway while maintaining high stability, iron foam (IF)&#8208;supported Ni 0.75 Fe 2.25 O 4 (NiFeO) with geometrical defects of [NiO 6 ] (nickel cation coordinated with six oxygen anions) units and higher ratio of Fe to Ni cations in octahedral sites ( d &#8208;NiFe HR O/IF) is prepared by ion&#8208;exchanging with polar aprotic solvent followed by annealing. As a result, as&#8208;synthesized d &#8208;NiFe HR O/IF exhibits excellent activity (at 295 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 34.6 mV dec &#8722;1 ), and high stability (maintaining a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 over 130 h) for the OER. The theoretical calculations reveal that the construction of octahedral defect in Ni x Fe 3&#8208;x O 4 enhances the overlap of Fe&#8208; d and O&#8208; p orbitals, which can activate the lattice oxygen. Therefore, increasing the ratio of Fe to Ni will further improve the lattice oxygen redox activity, and thus trigger the fast LOM pathway, ultimately facilitating the OER process.</description>

                Resolving the three-dimensional structure of transition metal oxide nanoparticles (TMO-NPs), upon self-restructuring from solution, is crucial for tuning their structure&#8211;functionality. Yet, this remains challenging as this process entails complex structure fluctuations, which are difficult to track experimentally and, hence, hinder the knowledge-driven optimization of TMO-NPs. Herein, we combine high-energy synchrotron X-ray absorption and X-ray total scattering experiments with atomistic multiscale simulations to investigate the self-restructuring of self-assembled Co-NPs from solution under dark or photocatalytic water oxidation conditions at distinct reaction times and atomic length-scales. Using the atomic range order as a descriptor, we reveal that dissolution of a Co-salt in BO3 buffer leads to a self-optimization route forming disordered oxyborate Co3BOx-NPs unveiling a high oxygen yield due to the formation of surface oxo/hydroxo adsorbates. Those Co3BOx-NPs further self-restructure into distorted Co3O4-NPs and, lastly, into distorted CoOOH-NPs through a rate-limiting step integrating Co3+-states during the course of a representative photocatalytic assay. Self-restructuring does not proceed from amorphous-to-ordered states but through stochastic fluctuations of atomic nanoclusters of &#8776;10 &#197; domain size. Our key insight into the structure-selection dynamics of TMO-NPs from solution offers a route for tuning their structure&#8211;function relationships for wide-ranging emergent technologies.</description>

      <title>Edge&#8208;Induced Synergy of Ni&#8208;Ni Defects in NiFe Layered&#8208;Double&#8208;Hydroxide for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Reaction</title>

                Abstract Defect engineering is widely regarded as a promising strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, defective NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) with a high density of edge sites (edge&#8208;rich NiFe LDH) is synthesized via a simple reduction process during the early stages of nucleation. The introduction of edges into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts modulates the electronic structure of the active sites. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses revealed that the edges facilitated the formation of unsaturated Ni&#8208;Ni coordination, which is crucial for promoting the deprotonation of the OH * intermediate. Consequently, the edge&#8208;rich NiFe LDH exhibited a significantly lower overpotential of 228 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 , compared to 275 mV for pristine NiFe LDH. The assembled membrane electrode can reach a current density of 1000 mA cm&#8315; 2 at a cell voltage of 2.5 V. This study highlights the role of edge effects in defect engineering to enhance OER activity and provides valuable theoretical insights for the design of efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Effective first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts are crucial for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios in NiFe&#8208;LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm&#8315; 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe&#8208;LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non&#8208;noble composites for long&#8208;term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.</description>

                Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B&#8208;site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B&#8242; and B&#8243; sites. Controlling B&#8208;site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B&#8208;site cation with a d&#8208;band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of &#8722;8.05 mA cm &#8722;2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm &#8722;2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at &#8722;1 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), &#916;E is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as&#8208;designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.</description>

                The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon monoxide (CO) via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction offers a promising pathway toward a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the competing Sabatier reaction presents a significant challenge, underscoring the need for highly efficient catalysts. In this study, we developed a novel catalyst comprising cobalt-oxide-supported nickel-hydroxide nanoparticles (denoted as Co@Ni). This catalyst achieved a remarkable CO production yield of ~5,144 &amp;mu;mol gcatalyst&#8315;&amp;sup1; at 573 K, with a CO selectivity of 77%. These values represent 30% and 70% improvements over carbon-supported Ni(OH)2 (Ni-AC) and CoO (Co-AC) nanoparticles, respectively. Comprehensive physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses reveal that the exceptional CO yield of the Co@Ni catalyst stems from the synergistic electronic interactions between adjacent active sites. Specifically, cobalt-oxide domains act as electron donors to Ni sites, facilitating efficient H2 splitting. Additionally, the oxygen vacancies in cobalt oxide enhance CO2 adsorption and promote subsequent dissociation. These findings provide critical insights into the design of highly efficient and selective catalysts for the RWGS reaction, paving the way for advancements in sustainable carbon utilization technologies.</description>

      <description>Gaoxian Li, Yuanhang Wang, Nan Gao, Hongdong Li, Applied Physics Letters. 125(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405323235

                To alleviate the increasingly serious energy issues, it is essential to develop highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we employed density functional theory to investigate a broad spectrum of transition metal (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Ag, W, Ir, and Pt) atoms supported on N-terminated diamond (100) surface (TM@ND) as single-atom catalysts for their OER and ORR performances. TM atoms (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, and Ir) show large binding energy with substrate and thermal stability, which is advantageous for electrocatalytic reactions. Especially, Ir@ND demonstrates high efficacy as an OER electrocatalyst, and Mn@ND is identified as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst, exhibiting the theoretical overpotentials smaller than 1 V. Consequently, it suggests that diamond-based catalysts could serve as promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications.</description>

                The core of clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries depends on a series of oxygen and hydrogen-based electrocatalysis reactions, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which necessitate cost-effective electrocatalysts to improve their energy efficiency.

                Glucose electrocatalytic-conversion reaction (GCR) is a promising anode reaction to replace the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus promoting the development of hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting. Herein, NiFe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) is used as a precursor to prepare W-doped nickel-iron phosphide (W-NiFeP) nanosheet arrays by ion exchange and phosphorylation, which exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), featuring an overpotential of only -179 mV to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm</description>

                Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in conjunction with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers a feasible and environmentally friendly approach for handling urea-rich wastewater and generating energy-saving hydrogen. However, the deactivation and detachment of active sites in powder electrocatalysts reported hitherto present significant challenges to achieving high efficiency and sustainability in energy-saving hydrogen production.

                Abstract Achieving large&#8208;scale coupling of organic electrooxidation and the hydrogen evolution reaction, while understanding the competition between organic electrooxidation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a significant challenge. In this study, using Ni 3 N&#8208;MoN/NF, an efficient heterojunction electrocatalyst as both anode and cathode in a 50 cm 2 continuous flow reactor, we achieved a total current of ~20 A at 2.6 V. This resulted in the highest single&#8208;pass 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural conversion efficiency (0.049 mmol cm &#8722;2 min &#8722;1 ) and gram&#8208;level production of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. Theoretical studies revealed that MoN accelerated *OH formation and increased its deprotonation energy barrier, leading to *OH accumulation, effectively promoting organic electrooxidation and inhibiting OER. We anticipate that our foundation in understanding the reaction mechanism and catalyst design strategy can be extended to a wider range of anodic oxidation reactions.</description>

                Producing hydrogen through water splitting often faces challenges of overpotential, stability, and expensive catalysts, which limit its efficiency and hinder the advancement of hydrogen production technologies. Nickel foam and nickel meshes have emerged as promising materials for electrolyzer electrodes due to their high surface area and the ability to produce electrolyzers with a very small gap between the anode and cathode. This study presents a simple method for coating Ni-based electrodes with a chiral Ni&#8211;Au film, using electroplating, thus enhancing its efficiency dramatically. We introduce chirality to the electroplating layer by incorporating an enantiopure chiral reagent into the electroplating solution. The chiral layer enhances the oxygen evolution reaction due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect. By optimizing the chiral electroplating process, we demonstrate the reduction of the overpotential and an increase in the reaction efficiency by 95% at 1 M KOH at room temperature.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an indispensable anode reaction for sustainable hydrogen production from water electrolysis, yet overreliance on metal-based catalysts featured with vibrant d-electrons. It still has notable gap between metal-free and metal-based electrocatalysts, due to lacking accurate and efficient p-band regulation methods on non-metal atoms. Herein, a molecular modularization strategy is proposed for fine-tuning the p-orbital states of series metal-free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for realizing OER performance beyond benchmark precious metal catalysts. Optimized combination of benzodioxazole/benzodiimide-based building blocks achieves an impressive applied potential of 1.670 &#177; 0.004 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 1.735 &#177; 0.006 V versus RHE to deliver enhanced current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A cm</description>

                Photosystem II (PSII) splits water in oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. The structure and function of the C 4 S 4 M 2 -type PSII-LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) megacomplexes from the wild-type and PsbR-deletion mutant plants are studied through electron microscopy (EM), structural mass spectrometry, and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy [time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)]. The cryo-EM structure of a type I C 4 S 4 M 2 megacomplex demonstrates that the three domains of PsbR bind to the stromal side of D1, D2, and CP43; associate with the single transmembrane helix of the redox active Cyt b 559 ; and stabilize the luminal extrinsic PsbP, respectively. This megacomplex, with PsbR and PsbY centered around the narrow interface between two dimeric PSII cores, provides the supramolecular structural basis that regulates the plastoquinone occupancy in Q B site, excitation energy transfer, and oxygen evolution. PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (types I and II) and LHC aggregation levels in Arabidopsis psbR mutant were also interrogated and compared to wild-type plants through EM and picosecond TRF.</description>

                Side reactions of water decomposition and capacitive reactions occur concomitantly in aqueous supercapacitors. To improve the energy density, integrated design modifications to address the impact of these two aspects on the reaction kinetics are theoretically effective. Herein, a two-step modification strategy for introducing binary functional species is designed to regulate the chemical environment and electronic structure of the metal active sites and further optimize the electrochemical kinetics comprehensively. For promoting the capacitive reactions, Ag nanoparticles were loaded to decrease the corresponding energy barriers. For suppressing the oxygen evolution side reaction, preintercalation of K+ ions was realized to increase the corresponding energy barriers. The assembled supercapacitor device shows an ultrahigh energy density of 143.2 Wh kg&#8211;1. Uniquely, in situ techniques, DFT calculations, and overpotential tests are combined to verify the suppression mechanism. This work provides valuable guidance for coordinating designs and studies on the electrochemical kinetics of transition-metal-based electrode materials.</description>

                Abstract Spinel oxides still exhibit unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) given their low intrinsic activity, poor electronic conductivity, and limited exposure of reaction sites. Defect engineering has garnered intensive attention and become a promising strategy to enhance the reaction kinetics. In this work, spinel NiFe 2 O 4 nanospheres with rich nickel vacancies are prepared via simple one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis. Combined electrochemical measurements and in situ Raman characterization prove that a relatively higher degree of electrochemical surface reconstruction is realized after the introduction of nickel vacancies in NiFe 2 O 4 , in addition to boosted OER electrocatalytic performance. Further theoretical calculations also reveal that the cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced effect can reduce the difficulty for surface reconstruction by increasing the octahedral nickel&#8208;oxygen covalency in nickel ferrite. Contributed to the great structural flexibility and optimized electronic structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst, the reconstructed electrocatalyst presents desirable OER performance, accompanied by long durability in alkaline solution. This work provides a sound strategy to intensify surface reconstruction on spinel oxides and design electrocatalysts with high efficiency toward water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract Photoelectrocatalysis has the capability to utilize solar energy to produce hydrogen and valuable chemicals; however, their conversion efficiency remains to reach practical thresholds. Here, a rapid&#8208;ramping annealing strategy is reported to synthesize nanoporous Mo&#8208;doped bismuth vanadate (MBVO) photoanodes with (001)&#8208;preferred orientation. This approach leverages the enhanced carrier transport along the crystallographic [001] direction, optimizing the bulk photoelectrical properties of the MBVO photoanodes. By substituting the surface oxygen evolution reaction with the glycerol oxidation reaction, the photoconversion efficiency is significantly boosted, reaching a photocurrent density of 7.45 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus RHE and an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion efficiency of &#8776;100% for hydrogen generation, accompanied by the production of value&#8208;added products in a high rate (&#8776;1700 mmol m &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 in total) with a total Faradaic efficiency up to 96%. These results shed light on the construction of practical photoelectrocatalysis systems by demonstrating the potential of bulk&#8208;phase engineering coupled with surface reaction design.</description>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction Induced by Preconditioning in Different Electrolytes Impacts Electrooxidation of Solketal on Multi&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202419911</link>
      <description>Jian Zhang, Bhawana Kumari, Thomas Quast, Steffen Cychy, Ignacio Sanju&#225;n, Martin Muhler, Wolfgang Schuhmann, Corina Andronescu, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405384345

                Abstract The electrocatalytic oxidation of solketal (SOR) as the anodic reaction can be used to enhance hydrogen production efficiency due to its lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, solketal oxidation yields besides formate also high&#8208;value C 3 products, providing an advantage over the typical alternative reaction for OER, glycerol oxidation. The multi&#8208;metal CoNiFeCu (1:1:1:0.5) catalyst is employed as electrocatalyst for SOR and different activation procedures are explored. The pre&#8208;conditioning of the catalyst in the presence of solketal supports a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 to be recorded at only 1.405 &#177; 1 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) during SOR, while promoting glyceric acid synthesis with 40% faradaic efficiency. Operando attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR) confirms that the activation of the catalyst contributes to an increased formation of products. However, most importantly, through utilizing the single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;nanoelectrode with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscope (IL&#8208;TEM), it is unveiled that solketal suppresses Cu leaching and oxyhydroxide formation. Moreover, the structural transformations are correlated with the increased activity toward SOR.</description>

                Abstract To address the urgent need for sustainable energy processes, there is a growing demand for multifunctional materials that mimic natural photosynthetic enzyme functions, specifically light&#8208;harvesting, efficient photoinduced charge separation, and integration of molecularly defined catalysts, synergistically interacting within these structures. Herein, the successful synthesis of an innovative Covalent Organic Framework ( COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;IsoQ ) constructed from optically active triazine (TFPT) and isoquinoline units (IsoQ) as building blocks is reported. Post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of a Ru(bda)&#8208;based water oxidation catalyst (WOC) is achieved through the IsoQ moieties acting as coordinating sites. Leveraging the synthetic flexibility of the designed COF architecture featuring binding sites on its pore walls, various Ru@COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;IsoQ systems at different Ru:COF ratios are synthesized and tested in the photoinduced (&#955; &gt; 400 nm) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under sacrificial conditions. All synthesized Ru@COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;IsoQ systems demonstrate efficiency in the photocatalytic OER, with the highest turnover number (TON) of 9.1 observed for the system where the Ru&#8208;based WOC is incorporated every fourth COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;IsoQ unit cell. This work provides valuable insights into the structural integration and catalytic behavior of Ru&#8208;based complexes within COF architectures, highlighting the potential of Ru@COF&#8208;TFPT&#8208;IsoQ as a robust, efficient, and synthetically flexible multifunctional material for light&#8208;induced water oxidation catalysis.</description>

                Abstract Seawater electrolysis is an effective way for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen. Nevertheless, the anode suffers from the severe corrosion of Cl &#8722; and Br &#8722; during oxygen evolution, which gives rise to the issues of narrow&#8208;deep pits and shallow&#8208;wide pits, respectively. Herein, an anti&#8208;corrosion strategy is presented by self&#8208;adapting oxyanion armor to prevent the high valence active sites from Cl &#8722; and Br &#8722; corrosion. The core&#8211;shell FeNi 2 Se 4 @NiFe&#8208;Phy is reconstructed to active species NiFeOOH covered by an oxyanion layer composed of phosphoric and carbonate. The aimed anode exhibits remarkable efficiency, achieving current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm &#8722;2 at overpotentials of merely 220 and 277 mV, respectively. Notably, it shows unparalleled durability, enduring without any discernible degradation following rigorous testing for 400 h at 400&#8211;1000 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline simulated seawater, as well as natural seawater. A combination of density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations further confirms the bifunctional enhancement of oxyanion armor on NiFeOOH surface. At a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , the alkaline seawater electrolyzer has significant energy efficiency, consuming merely 4.61 and 4.27 kWh Nm &#8722;3 H 2 at room temperature and 80 &#176;C, respectively. This work offers an efficacious surface corrosion resistance strategy for anode protection during seawater electrolysis.</description>

                During the chemical and biological evolution of the Earth, its atmosphere changed from a highly reducing state to the oxygen-rich state that we know today. Free molecular oxygen (dioxygen) probably appeared on the Earth's surface some 2 billion years ago as a result of photosynthetic microorganisms acquiring the ability to split water. Oxygen is now the most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the second most abundant element in the biosphere. The concentration of molecular oxygen (hereafter referred to as oxygen) in dry air has risen to 21%. Iron, the element of equal importance in this story, is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust.</description>

                Low-metallicity Wolf&#8211;Rayet (WR) populations, such as the one of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are expected to be slightly influenced by metallicity-dependent effects, such as envelope inflation, which typically positions stars at cooler temperatures. Consequently, these populations should be easier to understand from a theoretical point of view. Yet, the observed bimodal temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC cannot be explained by existing single-star or binary evolution models. To better understand the observed temperature distribution of WR stars in the SMC, the role of the evolutionary secondary and its response to mass transfer is studied here in detail. To achieve this, I calculated a small grid of binary evolution models at the SMC metallicity, that follows the evolution of both the primary and secondary stars in detail. The analysis of the new binary evolution models suggests that hot (T &#8776; 100 kK), hydrogen-poor WN-type stars are the descendants of &#8220;ordinary&#8221; primary stars or secondaries that have accreted less than a few percent of their initial mass. In contrast, moderate-temperature (T &#8776; 50 kK) WN stars can emerge through two channels: (i) as former accretors that underwent rejuvenation, altering their interior structure and leading to higher surface oxygen abundances (XO = 20&#215;10&#8722;5) after mass-transfer, or (ii) as luminous stars experiencing envelope inflation, that exhibit surface oxygen abundances in accordance with the CNO-equilibrium value (XO = 2&#215;10&#8722;5). The first observational evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from the WR star SMC AB 4, whose optical spectra can only be explained with a stellar atmosphere model having a surface oxygen abundance one order of magnitude higher than the CNO-equilibrium value. Following the binary evolution models, secondary stars that have accreted mass relatively conservatively and, thus, got rejuvenated will evolve at low metallicity into WN stars with moderate temperatures and should be accompanied by a compact object. This would imply that the WN-type star SMC AB 4 should have a so far unseen compact companion. Future spectroscopic surveys focusing on surface oxygen abundances and multiplicity among SMC WR stars are key to further understanding massive star evolution and the role of binarity in forming WR stars in low-metallicity environments.</description>

                In order to study the dynamic evolution of the &#8220;three zones&#8221; of spontaneous combustion and the distribution characteristics of oxygen concentration under different advancing distances in the compound goaf of shallow coal seam, through the field measurement of oxygen concentration in the goaf and the analysis of the development law and air leakage mechanism of the overlying rock fractures in the goaf, the calculation model of the compound goaf of shallow coal seam was established by using fluent simulation software. The depth, width, and dynamic evolution of the oxidation zone and oxygen concentration were obtained as the advancing distance increased in the lower and upper goaf, respectively. The results indicate that: in the secondary mining stage, with the increase of the advance distance, the oxidation zones on both sides of the overlying goaf and the lower goaf gradually extend backward, and finally form a &#8220;high on both sides, low in the middle&#8221; oxygen concentration distribution pattern within 100 m to 500 m of the goaf. At the same position, the width of the oxidation zone in the overlying goaf is less than that in the lower goaf, and the risk of spontaneous combustion is less than that in the lower goaf. After the advancing distance is greater than 100 m, the width of the oxidation zone at the air inlet side of the overlying goaf decreases with the increasing of the advancing distance, and the width of the oxidation zone at the air return side increases, and the width of the oxidation zone at both sides finally tends to be the same, The width of oxidation zone on both sides of the lower goaf increases first and then decreases with the increase of distance. The research results indicate that the evolution law of &#8220;three zones&#8221; of spontaneous combustion in the composite goaf during the mining process of shallow buried coal seams, and provide reference for preventing and controlling the spontaneous combustion caused by air leakage in the composite goaf in shallow buried depth.</description>

      <title>The Mitochondrial Genomes of the Reef-Dwelling Spiny Lobsters Panulirus echinatus and Panulirus interruptus with Insights into the Phylogeny and Adaptive Evolution of Protein-Coding Genes in the Achelata</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.14293/p2199-8442.1.sop-.pio36p.v1</link>
      <description>Alyssa Baker, Natalie Stephens, F&#225;bio Mendon&#231;a Diniz, Francisco J. Garc&#237;a&#8208;D&#233; Le&#243;n, A. Baeza, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405376035

                Temperature and oxygen levels drive the evolution of morphological, behavioral, and physiological traits in marine invertebrates, including crustaceans. Environmental conditions are also expected to prompt the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs), which are vital for energy production via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. We formally tested for adaptive evolution in mitochondrial protein-coding genes in representatives of the decapod infraorder Achelata, including two spiny lobsters, Panulirus echinatus and Panulirus interruptus , for which we sequenced complete mitochondrial genomes (15,644 and 15,659 bp long, respectively). A phylomitogenomic analysis based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs for 24 species belonging to the infraorder Achelata, plus an outgroup representing the infraorders Caridea and Nephropidae, supported the monophyly of the genus Panulirus , the families Palinuridae and Scyllaridae, and the infraorder Achelata. Over the strong negative selection background observed for mitochondrial PCGs in the Achelata, signatures of positive selective pressure were detected within PCGs in equatorial Panulirus spp. and deepwater Scyllaridae. In Panulirus spp. inhabiting equatorial latitudes with consistently high temperatures, the Datamonkey analysis RELAX suggested intensified purifying selection strength in 9 of the 13 PCGs and relaxation in purifying selection strength in atp6, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complex I, III, and IV PCGs. Likewise, in Scyllaridae species inhabiting depths with low oxygen levels, RELAX indicated relaxed selection strength in 6 of the 13 PCGs, while aBSREL, BUSTED, and MEME recovered signatures of positive selection on PCGs within Complexes I, III, IV, and V. Adaptive evolution likely retains mutations that improve protein stability at sustained temperatures and enhance mitochondrial capacity for energy metabolism in low oxygen conditions. These mutations likely optimize the ability of Complex I to pump protons into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, improve electron transfer and proton translocation in Complex III, boost the efficiency with which Complex IV transfers electrons to oxygen to form water, and refine the ability of Complex V to produce energy via oxidative phosphorylation. The newly assembled mitochondrial genomes of P. echinatus and P. interruptus represent new genomic resources to aid the conservation and management of lobsters targeted by major fisheries through applications such as bioprospecting using eDNA sampling and species identification via DNA barcoding. This study also contributes to our understanding of how environmental conditions drive adaptive evolution in spiny and slipper lobster mitochondrial PCGs and supports the notion that mitochondrial protein-coding genes can and do experience adaptive evolution to optimize mitochondrial function in a wide variety of organisms. Further research is needed to clarify which and how environmental conditions influence the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial PCGs in other crustacean lineages and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ecogeographic body size clines in turtles: analysis and synthesis of pattern and process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blae108</link>

                Abstract The mechanisms underpinning the evolution of ectotherm body size across temperature and latitude remain an enduring mystery. Oxygen limitation in warmer aquatic environments is often invoked to explain steeper temperature&#8211;size relationships of aquatic species across latitude, but the role of aquatic environments on body size evolution of aquatic species that respire primarily in air is unclear. We tested the generality of intraspecific temperature&#8211;size responses in Testudines, assessing whether turtles generally follow Bergmann&#8217;s Rule, and whether aquatic versus terrestrial turtles exhibit different temperature&#8211;size responses. Using a global dataset of turtle body sizes, we found that turtles generally show decreasing body size with increasing temperature. However, we also found that aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial turtles respond similarly to temperature. Our study affirms the possibility that temperature&#8211;size relationships are driven partly by oxygen limitation in other ectotherms, but casts doubt on hypotheses related to oxygen limitation for groups that respire primarily in air. We formalize and explore a hypothesis that temperature&#8211;size responses in turtles are a result of heat balance, arguing small size in warm environments reduces overheating risk, and large size in cool environments minimizes heat loss. Ultimately, we provide new insight and direction in the study of ecogeographic clines.</description>

                Anionic redox has emerged as a transformative paradigm for high-energy layered transition-metal (TM) oxide cathodes, but it is usually accompanied by the formation of anionic redox-mediated oxygen vacancies (OVs) due to irreversible oxygen release. Additionally, external factor-induced OVs (defined as intrinsic OVs) also play a pivotal role in the physicochemical properties of layered TM oxides. However, an in-depth understanding of the interplay between intrinsic and anionic redox-mediated OVs and the corresponding regulation mechanism of the dynamic evolution of OVs is still missing. Herein, we disclose the strong interrelationship between these OVs and demonstrate that the presence of intrinsic OVs in the TMO</description>

      <title>Molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban Beijing: insights from Vocus-PTR measurements</title>

                Abstract. Understanding the composition and evolution of atmospheric organic vapors is crucial for exploring their impact on air quality. However, the molecular and seasonal characteristics of organic vapors in urban areas, with complex anthropogenic emissions and high variability, remain inadequately understood. In this study, we conducted measurements in urban Beijing during 2021&#8211;2022, covering four seasons, using improved proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (Vocus-PTR-MS). During the measurement period, a total of 895 peaks were observed, and 512 of them can be assigned to formulas. The contribution of CxHyOz species is most significant, composing up to 54 % of the number and 74 % of the mixing ratio of total organics. With enhanced sensitivity and mass resolution, various species with multiple oxygens (&#8805; 3) or at a level of sub-parts per trillion (ppt) were observed, with 44 % of the number measured at sub-ppt level and 38 % of the number containing three&#8211;eight oxygen atoms. Organic vapors with multiple oxygens mainly consist of intermediate/semi-volatile compounds, and many formulae detected were reported to be the oxidation products of various volatile organic precursors. In summer, the fast photooxidation process generated organic vapors with multiple oxygens and led to an increase in both their mixing ratio and proportion, while, in other seasons, the variations in organic vapors with multiple oxygens were closely correlated with those of organic vapors with 1&#8211;2 oxygens, which could be substantially influenced by primary emissions. Organic vapors with low oxygen content (&#8804; 2 oxygens) are comparable to the results obtained by traditional PTR-MS measurements in both urban Beijing and neighboring regions.</description>

                Vascular plants and metazoans use selective proteolysis of transcription factors to control the adaptive responses to hypoxia, although through distinct biochemical mechanisms. The reason for this divergence is puzzling, especially when considering that the molecular components necessary to establish both strategies are conserved across the two kingdoms. To explore an alternative evolutionary scenario where plants sense hypoxia as animals do, we engineered a three-components system aimed to target proteins for degradation in an oxygen dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana. Applying the synthetic biology framework, we produced a hypoxia-responsive switch independent of endogenous pathways. When applied to control transcription, the synthetic system partially restored hypoxia responsiveness in oxygen-insensitive mutants. Additionally, we demonstrated its potential to regulate growth under flood-induced hypoxia. Our work highlights the use of synthetic biology to reprogram signalling pathways in plants, providing insights into the evolution of oxygen sensing and offering tools for crop improvement under stress conditions.</description>

      <title>To Explode or Not Explode? An Analysis of the Explodability of Binary and Single Stars</title>

                Abstract Most massive stars in our universe are born in binary systems, and yet their fates are quite uncertain, due to a poor understanding of their evolution. It is well known, however, that the density profile of a collapsing core, particularly at the interface between silicon and oxygen shells, is important when determining the explodability of a star. While this has been studied for single stars, it has been rarely studied for binary stars. In this note, we explore the explodability of single and binary stars using self-consistent supernova simulations. We study the differences in the silicon&#8211;oxygen interface and compactness of the progenitor stars and how they affect the explodability. We find that binary-stripped stars with initial masses above 37 M &#8857; are not as explodable as their single-star counterparts.</description>

      <title>Using stable isotopes in deciphering climate changes from travertine deposits: the case of the Lapis Tiburtinus succession (Acque Albule Basin, Tivoli, Central Italy)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.ps8082</link>
      <description>, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405512563

                Quaternary stable isotope records of marine and lacustrine carbonate deposits as well as speleothems were extensively studied to reconstruct global and regional climatic evolution. This study demonstrates how stable isotope records of travertine provide fundamental information about climate and the consequences of its evolution on groundwater level fluctuations. The deposition of the Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession occurred during the Late Pleistocene (150&#8211;30 ka), coeval with the last activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex. Two boreholes (Sn1 and Sn2) were drilled into the Acque Albule Basin (23 km E of Rome), crossing the entire Lapis Tiburtinus succession. The Sn1 borehole in the central part of the basin crosscuts a travertine succession of 62.1 m in thickness, while the Sn2 borehole in the southern part of the basin is characterized by a travertine succession 36.3 m in thickness. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios were analysed on 118 samples (59 samples both for Sn1 and Sn2 boreholes) representative of the entire Lapis Tiburtinus travertine succession crossed by the boreholes. Values, measured and correlated in the two drilled boreholes, permitted determination of the sensitivity of the travertine depositional system to glacial and interglacial cycles, unravelling the complex oxygen and carbon cycle dynamic recorded in such sedimentary succession. Moreover, the results obtained correlated with available pollen curves of the Mediterranean area (from the Castiglione crater, 25 km E of Rome). Regional and global oxygen isotope continental and marine curves, calibrated with the stratigraphy of the Acque Albule Basin, and available U/Th dating allow the identification of at least three phases of the last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5-MIS5). The carbon isotope record, compared with CO2 flux reconstructed and associated with the volcanic activity of the Colli Albani volcanic complex, instead shows an influence from groundwater level changes. In particular, positive shifts that occurred during arid phases are associated with a lower groundwater level and increased CO2 degassing, inducing a major fractionation effect on carbon isotopes. Instead, the negative shifts occurring during more humid periods indicate the inhibition of CO2 degassing and increase in pressure, attesting to a rise in groundwater level. In this view, travertine deposits, frequently studied to define the tectonic setting and activity of the area where they develop, can thus also be used as a tool to understand climate changes and groundwater variations apparent in their stable oxygen and carbon isotope signature.</description>

                Abstract The possibility of reducing energy costs during hydrogen release was realized using a system in which the anodic process of oxygen release was replaced by the process of dissolution of an electronegative metal (aluminum alloy). The rate of hydrogen release on aluminum, among other equal conditions (temperature and concentration of the electrolyte), depends on the polarization of hydrogen release. On aluminum - a metal of the third group of the periodic table of elements, it is high. The dissolution (corrosion) rate of aluminum can be increased by short-circuiting with an electrode with a low hydrogen evolution polarization, such as nickel. The ratio of hydrogen evolution currents on aluminum and nickel was estimated. The effect of alkali concentration and temperature on the current density, polarization and polarizability of electrodes made of aluminum alloy containing Cu, Mg, Mn and Fe was determined. It was shown that in a 0.1 mol l&#8722; 1 NaOH solution at a temperature of 20&#176;C, the polarization resistance of hydrogen release on nickel is lower than on aluminum, and the hydrogen release rate on Ni is higher. At high temperatures and sodium hydroxide concentrations, the polarizability of metal dissolution and hydrogen release on aluminum increases sharply and exceeds those on nickel.</description>

                The formation of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) presents challenges such as efficiency losses and fine dust emissions in practical iron combustion systems, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of the formation mechanisms and thermochemical conditions. This study combines experiments and multi-scale simulations to analyze NP clouds generated by single iron particles burning in high-temperature oxidizing environments. The ambient gas conditions were provided by a laminar flat flame burner, with post-flame oxygen mole fractions varied between 20, 30, and 40 vol% at a constant temperature of ~1800K. High-speed in-situ diagnostics were used to measure particle size, NP initiation, NP cloud evolution, and microparticle surface temperature history. The experimental setup utilized three 10kHz imaging systems: one for two-color pyrometry and two for diffusive-backlight illumination (DBI), targeting particle size and NP measurements. The findings showcase the powerful capabilities of multi-physics diagnostics in quantifying NP initiation time and temperature, which depend on particle size and ambient oxygen concentration. CFD simulations revealed enhanced convection velocity driven by increased Stefan flow, which transported NPs toward parent iron particles under high-oxygen conditions. This delayed the detection of NP clouds, leading to higher microparticle temperatures at NP initiation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations uncovered FeO2(g) as a key NP precursor, forming when Fe atoms dissociate from the liquid phase. The initial temperature significantly influenced the resulting nanocluster composition, with Fe(II) dominating at higher temperatures and Fe(III) at lower temperatures. This integrated approach enhances understanding of NP formation in iron combustion, offering insights into the conditions affecting nanoparticle characteristics.</description>

                ABSTRACT The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis during the Archean (4&#8211;2.5 Ga) required the presence of complementary reducing pathways to maintain the cellular redox balance. While the timing of the evolution of superoxide dismutases (SODs), enzymes that convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and O 2 , within bacteria and archaea is not resolved, the first SODs appearing in cyanobacteria contained copper and zinc in the reaction center (CuZnSOD). Here, we analyse growth characteristics, SOD gene expression (qRT&#8208;PCR) and cellular enzyme activity in the deep branching strain, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367, previously demonstrated to release significantly more O 2 under anoxic conditions. The observed significantly higher growth rates ( p &lt; 0.001) and protein and glycogen contents ( p &lt; 0.05) in anoxically cultured Pseudanabaena PCC7367 compared to control cultures grown under present&#8208;day oxygen&#8208;rich conditions prompted the following question: Is the growth of Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367 correlated to atmospheric p O 2 and cellular SOD activity? Expression of sodB (encoding FeSOD) and sodC (encoding CuZnSOD) strongly correlated with medium O 2 levels ( p &lt; 0.001). Expression of sodA (encoding MnSOD) correlated significantly to SOD activity during the day ( p = 0.019) when medium O 2 concentrations were the highest. The cellular SOD enzyme activity of anoxically grown cultures was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.001) 2 h before the onset of the dark phase compared to O 2 &#8208;rich growth conditions. The expression of SOD encoding genes was significantly reduced ( p &lt; 0.05) under anoxic conditions in stirred cultures, as were medium O 2 levels ( p &#8804; 0.001), compared to oxic&#8208;grown cultures, whereas total cellular SOD activity remained comparable. Our data suggest that increasing p O 2 negatively impacts the viability of early cyanobacteria, possibly by increasing photorespiration. Additionally, the increased expression of superoxide&#8208;inactivating genes during the dark phase suggests the increased replacement rates of SODs under modern&#8208;day conditions compared to those on early Earth.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation study on the mechanism of plasma dissociation of carbon dioxide in atmospheric pressure packed-bed reactors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7498/aps.74.20241241</link>
      <description>Yi Peng, Chunjing Wang, Jing Li, K. Gao, Han Xu, Chuan-Jie Chen, Muyang Qian, Bingyan Dong, Dezhen Wang, Acta Physica Sinica. 74(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405263325

                The streamer propagation and electric field distribution in a two-dimensional fluid model of a packed bed reactor (PBR) filled with carbon dioxide are comprehensively studied by utilizing the PASSKEy simulation platform in this work. The spatiotemporal evolution of electron density, electric fields and key plasma species in the discharge process are studied in depth. The PBR with layered dielectric spheres is simulated by using the model, indicating that the inner sides of the first layer and the second layer of dielectric spheres are not the main regions for reactions such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation; instead, the main regions are along the streamer propagation path and the outer side of the first layer of dielectric sphere. In this work, the propagation of streamers in an electric field is investigated, highlighting the influence of anode voltage rise and dielectric polarization on local electric field enhancement. This enhancement leads the electron density and temperature to increase, which facilitats streamer propagation and the formation of filamentary microdischarges and surface ionization waves. This work provides a detailed analysis of the local electric field evolution at specific points within the PBR, and a further investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial and surface charges, revealing that negative charges concentrate in the streamer and on the dielectric surface, with density being significantly higher than that of positive charges. The positive charge distribution is closely related to the streamer path, and with time going by, the charge distribution becomes dominated in the discharge space. This work also explores the surface charge deposition on the dielectric spheres, and discusses the evolution trend of the distribution. Additionally, this work discusses the temporal and spatial evolution of key plasma species, including ions and radicals, and their contributions to the overall discharge characteristics. The production mechanisms of carbon monoxide particles, carbon dioxide ions, and oxygen ions are analyzed, with a focus on their spatial distribution and correlation with electron density. Finally, the energy deposition within the PBR is examined by integrating the spatial energy deposition of electrons and major positive ions. The results indicate a total energy deposition value of approximately 1.428 mJ/m, with carbon dioxide ions accounting for 8.8% of this value.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity in electron-hole coexisting
  Sr$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ films</title>

                We report transport measurements of infinite-layer cuprate Sr$_{1-x}$Eu$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ films with controlled electron (by trivalent europium) and hole (by interstitial apical oxygen) carriers grown on SrTiO$_3$(001) with molecular beam epitaxy. An unusual enhancement of superconductivity upon moderate electron-hole coexistence in the films is found, which spans over the whole superconducting phase diagram and becomes more prominent in the underdoped regime. The superconductivity exhibits a two-dimensional nature with a thickness of approximately 5.2 nm, irrespective of the varying carriers, confirmed by angle-resolved magnetoresistance measurements and the Berzzinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Nevertheless, the electron-hole coexistence enlarges the thermal activation energy of vortex motion that deviates obviously from the usual logarithmic evolution with the magnetic field. Our results offer a promising perspective to understand and enhance the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Properties of Type Ibn/Icn Supernovae and Their
  Progenitor Channels through X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2412.09066</link>

                Type Ibn/Icn supernovae (SNe Ibn/Icn), which are characterized by narrow helium or carbon lines originated in hydrogen-poor dense circumstellar medium (CSM), provide new insights into the final evolution of massive stars. While SNe Ibn/Icn are expected to emit strong X-rays through the strong SN-CSM interaction, the X-ray emission modeling effort has been limited so far. In the present study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe Ibn/Icn. We find that the soft X-ray LC provides information about the CSM compositions, while the hard X-ray LC is a robust measure of the CSM density, the explosion energy, and the ejecta mass. In addition, considering the evolution of the ionization state in the unshocked CSM, a bright soft X-ray is expected in the first few days since the explosion, which encourages rapid X-ray follow-up observations as a tool to study the nature of SNe Ibn/Icn. Applying our model to the soft X-ray LCs of SNe Ibn 2006jc and 2022ablq, we derive that the CSM potentially contains a larger fraction of carbon and oxygen for SN 2006jc than 2022ablq, highlighting the power of the soft X-ray modeling to address the nature of the CSM. We also discuss detectability and observational strategy, with which the currently operating telescopes such as NuSTAR and Swift can offer an irreplaceable opportunity to explore the nature of these enigmatic rapid transients and their still-unclarified progenitor channel(s).</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory for Electrocatalytic Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/9783527846368.ch2</link>

                Electrocatalytic technology plays an important role in advancing green and sustainable energy. Various significant electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), have huge potential in green energy conversion. However, the conversion efficiency is limited by slow kinetic processes and high reaction overpotentials. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity is of paramount importance. Based on density functional theory (DFT), theoretical calculations can not only analyze the electrocatalytic reaction processes from the perspective of molecular structure and energy but also provide an in-depth understanding of the electronic structures of the catalysts and establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships between catalysts and electrocatalytic reactions. Thus, DFT calculations can offer theoretical basis and guidance for the design and preparation of efficient electrocatalysts. In this chapter, we will introduce some DFT calculation methods and several electrocatalytic reactions, aiming to help readers understand how DFT calculations are applied to electrocatalytic energy conversion.</description>

                Abstract The formation process plays a key role in developing long life and high energy density materials, during which the phase transition, strain evolution, and structural self&#8208;adaption interact rationally with each other to produce a qualified electrode for Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Taking the layered LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 cathode as an example, the substantial structural changes, both in the bulk and at the surface are thoroughly documented during the formation cycle. Upon initial charging, different phases emerge continuously, resulting in lattice mismatches, inhomogeneous strain, and microstructural distortions. The irreversible loss of lattice oxygen, combined with the spontaneous cation mixing and the formation of rock&#8208;salt phase at the surface, contributes to the initial capacity loss. As a self&#8208;adjustment process, this initial capacity loss facilitates the development of a robust Li x Ni 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 electrode by relieving internal strain and stabilizing the rippled layered structure, thereby ensuring highly reversible electrochemical behavior in subsequent cycles. These findings lay a solid foundation for the design and optimization of layered cathodes for rechargeable batteries.</description>

In this work, within the framework of a global three-dimensional chemical transport model, an analysis of all sources and sinks of odd oxygen and hydrogen families has been conducted, and the main chemical reactions determining the daytime evolution of these families depending on altitude, latitude, and season have been identified. The results obtained are used to simplify the algebraic relationships between the components of these families, derived from the conditions of photochemical equilibrium and intended for the retrieval of poorly measured minor impurities in the mesosphere at altitudes of 50-80 km, data validation, or clarifying the constants of photochemical reactions.</description>

                This case involves a 21-year-old male healthcare student with a medical history of HIV-1 infection for two years and anxiety disorder. He presented to the emergency department with hemoptysis and dyspnea of sudden onset. A thoracic CT scan revealed multiple bilateral nodular ground-glass opacities suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, noninvasive ventilatory support was initiated. A bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the presence of blood. He also showed an elevated troponin I, peaking at 2,915 ng/mL, with no electrocardiographic or echocardiographic abnormalities. Assuming an immune etiology, high-dose corticosteroids were initiated, with three days of methylprednisolone 1 g. However, the entire etiological study for DAH turned out negative. During a follow-up clinical interview, the patient admitted to having self-administered 1 mg of intravenous adrenaline shortly before the onset of symptoms. The patient showed a favorable evolution, with no recurrence of symptoms, allowing for oxygen therapy weaning. A follow-up chest CT on the ninth day of hospitalization showed no significant alterations. This case highlights the importance of a thorough history in determining the etiology of a potentially fatal disease, adding intravenous epinephrine as a potential trigger of hemoptysis due to exogenous agents.</description>

                The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag-Au-Cu-Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core-shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.</description>

                Abstract Investigations of the metabolic capabilities of anaerobic protists advances our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic life on Earth and for uncovering analogous extraterrestrial complex microbial life. Certain species of foraminiferan protists live in environments analogous to early Earth conditions when eukaryotes evolved, including sulfidic, anoxic, and hypoxic sediment porewaters. Foraminifera are known to form symbioses as well as to harbor organelles from other eukaryotes (chloroplasts), possibly bolstering the host&#8217;s independence from oxygen. The full extent of foraminiferal physiological capabilities is not fully understood. To date, evidence for foraminiferal anaerobiosis was gleaned from specimens first subjected to stresses associated with removal from in situ conditions. Here, we report comprehensive gene expression analysis of benthic foraminiferal populations preserved in situ on the euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) bathyal seafloor, thus avoiding environmental alterations associated with sample recovery, including pressure reduction, sunlight exposure, warming, and oxygenation. Metatranscriptomics, metagenome-assembled genomes, and measurements of substrate uptake were used to study the kleptoplastidic foraminifer Nonionella stella inhabiting sulfur-oxidizing bacterial mats of the Santa Barbara Basin, off California. We show N. stella energy generation under dark euxinia is unusual because it orchestrates complex metabolic pathways for ATP production and carbon fixation through the Calvin cycle. These pathways include extended glycolysis, anaerobic fermentation, sulfide oxidation, and the presence of a membrane-bound inorganic pyrophosphatase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes inorganic pyrophosphate to actively pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of the Electronic Properties of Selected Antioxidants Vitamin C, Uric Acid, NAC and Melatonin with Guanosine Derivatives: A Theoretical Study</title>

                Each cell in the human body is continually exposed to harmful external and internal factors. During evolution, cells have developed various defence systems, divided into enzymatic and non-enzymatic types, to which low-weight molecule antioxidants belong. In this article, the ionisation potential and electron affinity, as well as global reactivity descriptors of Vitamin C, Melatonin, Uric Acids, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, were theoretically investigated at the MP-2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory in the condensed (aqueous) phase. The vertical ionisation potential and electron affinity are discussed in terms of non-equilibrated and equilibrated solvent&#8211;solute interactions. Additionally, at the same theoretical level, the electronic properties of canonical and oxidised derivatives of guanine were analysed. The presented results indicate that the selected antioxidants for this study (Vitamin C, Uric Acid, NAC, and Melatonin) exhibit the highest adiabatic electron affinity, while guanine derivatives (Gua, OXOGua, Guo, dGuo, OXOGuo, OXOdGuo) are more prone to adiabatic radical cation formation. A red-ox balance (redox homeostasis) is crucial for intracellular signalling pathways that are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RO/NS)-dependent. Should this gentle balance be disrupted, either by an overload or deficit of species, physiological consequences may result, which in turn lead to pathological outcomes. On the other hand, maintaining the stability of the above balance of antioxidants/radicals may result in the improved effectiveness and safety of anticancer radiotherapy/chemotherapy or combined therapies with a subsequent increase in a patient&#8217;s quality of life.</description>

      <title>Underground Reservoirs Regulate the Composition and Metabolism of Microbial Community in Coal Mine Water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c09348</link>
      <description>Yang Li, Min Wu, Haiqin Zhang, Binbin Jiang, Yixiang Bao, Jie Li, Jing&#8208;Feng Li, Peng Li, Xinyue Yan, Tianqi Qin, ACS Omega. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405372559

                Underground reservoirs were used to purify water through filtration, adsorption, and biodegradation methods in coal mines. However, their effects on the composition and metabolism of microbial communities in mine water remain unknown. In this study, influent and effluent samples from underground reservoirs in seven coal mining areas were analyzed to compare their microbial community compositions and metabolites. The results indicate that the underground reservoirs can significantly reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) levels of mine water (values range from 7.79 to 8.50 for influent and 7.40 to 8.50 for effluent) and regulate water chemistry characteristics such as pH (values range from 7&#8211;1980 for influent and 5&#8211;20 for effluent). Since COD reflects the quantity of reducing substances in water, while total dissolved solids (TDS) indicates the total amount of dissolved solids, both parameters directly influence the physicochemical properties of water. This, in turn, affects microbial growth and metabolic pathways. Consequently, changes in these factors can lead to variations in microbial community composition as well as decreases in the Chao1 and Shannon indices. Underground reservoirs decreased the relative abundance of phyla Actinomycetota and Spirochaetota, and the decreased microbial groups were mainly belonging to phylum Bacillota. In addition, higher concentrations of metabolites, including lipids and lipid-like molecules, mixed metal/nonmetal compounds, hydrocarbon derivatives, nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues were detected in the effluent samples, and most of them were related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, selenocompound metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and the citrate cycle. In summary, this study provided theoretical and experimental support for the evolution mechanism of mine water quality in coal mine underground reservoirs.</description>

In this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews, we present a collection of reviews on some of the key research topics related to the design of components and understanding of the elementary processes in current and emerging water-electrolysis technologies.Green hydrogen is produced through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, or hydropower, or possibly nuclear energy, resulting in low carbon emissions. (1) While the CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced (kgCO2e/kgH2) depends on many factors and requires a lifecycle analysis to assess, the U.S. Department of Energy's Section 45 V tax credit targets green hydrogen at below 0.45 kgCO2e/kgH2. (2) This requires minimizing emissions throughout the entire production process, including electricity use and upstream activities. These emissions are much lower than "gray" hydrogen from reforming natural gas (CH4 + 2H2O &#8594; CO2 + 4H2) with &#8764;10 kgCO2e/kgH2 and "blue" hydrogen using natural gas with carbon capture and &#8764;4 kgCO2e/kgH2. (3)Green hydrogen can dramatically reduce carbon-dioxide emissions associated with transportation and heavy industry. In transportation, hydrogen will be used where direct electrification is challenging, for example in aviation, shipping, and trucking. How the hydrogen is used will depend on the scale and cost of the (currently expensive) infrastructure to store and transport hydrogen. Pipelines are in principle cost-effective, but retrofitting existing natural-gas infrastructure is difficult (in part due to metals embrittlement discussed in this issue (4)). Hydrogen can also be combined with captured CO2 in efficient thermochemical processes to produce hydrocarbons, such as methanol or synthetic aviation fuels. (5) These renewable fuels can displace conventional fossil fuels without requiring major infrastructure changes, but CO2 capture (not discussed here) is an issue. (6) Hydrogen is also essential for the production and upgrading of biofuels, particularly synthetic fuels derived from renewable biomass. Substantial amounts of hydrogen&#9472;roughly 1/2H2 per carbon atom&#9472;in the resulting fuel are used to remove heteroatoms via hydro-deoxygenation, hydro-desulfurization, and hydro-denitrogenation processes. (7)Green hydrogen is likely to serve important roles in the future fully renewable electric grid that must deal with intermittent wind and solar generation on the daily, seasonal, and decadal time scales. (8,9) When energy storage is needed to fill gaps in production over multiple days, electricity generation from fuel cells and stored hydrogen become economically compelling, especially as the costs of fuel cells and electrolyzers continue to rapidly decline. (10)The ability of green hydrogen electrolyzers to serve as dispatchable load will also play a large role in enabling a reliable, expanded, and fully renewable electric grid. When renewable energy production is high or demand low, electrolyzers ramp up to productively use surplus electricity, and during peak demand, electrolyzers turn down or off. The hydrogen produced from these intermittent electrolyzers will be buffered in storage facilities and piped for industrial uses in fertilizer synthesis via Haber&#8211;Bosch chemistry and future green-steel and synthetic fuels industries. Fertilizer synthesis alone accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions&#9472;most of which come from making the fossil hydrogen currently used (and thus readily displaced by green hydrogen). This also enables seasonal energy storage to ensure grid reliability and obviate the need for natural-gas peaker plants. Electric power markets will evolve to create profitable businesses around this range of grid services.Despite these advantages for green-hydrogen production, there remain many technical and scaling challenges. The U.S. DOE has established the Hydrogen Earthshot goal to reduce the cost of producing green hydrogen to $1 per kg by 2030, roughly an 80% reduction from the current &#8764;$5/kg. Storing and transporting hydrogen add more challenges that increase costs, as hydrogen gas has a low energy density compared to liquid hydrocarbons. Liquefaction of hydrogen requires energy-intensive processes. New infrastructure, including high-pressure tanks, possible cryogenic systems, and pipelines resistant to hydrogen embrittlement are needed. Transportation costs are historically expensive due to limited capacity, safety protocols, and energy losses from evaporation.There are a number of realistic pathways to reach the $1 per kg hydrogen target, bolstered by the science and technology innovation discussed in this thematic issue, coupled with reduced production costs with scaling. (11) A basic calculation is simple. The thermoneutral voltage for liquid water electrolysis is 1.48 V; below this voltage requires extra heat input. Faraday's law (and unit conversion) yields a minimum of 39.4 kW&#183;h per kg of hydrogen. A modern electrolyzer runs between 1.7 and 2.0 V, depending on current density, and there is additional electrical power associated with balance of plant. A practical high-performance electrolyzer thus requires &#8764;50 kW&#183;h per kg H2. Therefore, electricity is needed at $0.01&#8211;$0.015 per kW&#183;h so that the electricity cost is $0.50&#8211;$0.75 per kg H2.This need for extremely low-cost electrical energy has been used to argue that the cost target is not possible, particularly by entities involved in competing energy technologies. Yet the economics of the electric grid is changing. In 2024 there were a record number of hours with negative electricity prices in the European, Texas, and California markets where intermittent renewable generation has high penetration. While markets will adapt to limit negative electric prices, renewables will be overbuilt to provide capacity when rates are high&#9472;this necessarily leads to periods when rates are low. The fraction of time for which rates will average $0.01 per kW&#183;h is unknown but is likely to be substantial. A reasonable prediction is that electrolyzer systems can run with 30% capacity factor and access &#8764;$0.01 per kW&#183;h electricity, i.e. during the middle of the day and/or when there is high wind.While current electrolyzer prices from US and European manufacturers are too high to run at 30% capacity factor (&#8764;1000 $/kW combined price for alkaline stacks and balance of plant), (12) electrolyzer prices are dropping with manufacturing scale; similar, although a bit slower, to how battery and photovoltaic technologies have, (13) which both dropped &#8764;10&#215; since 2010. If we then assume a reasonable capital cost of $200 per kW by 2030, and a 20-year lifetime running at 30% capacity factor, the amortized cost is $0.19 per kg of H2. While there are additional maintenance, land, and financing costs, the sum of electric and equipment expenses can be below $1 per kg of hydrogen over a range of scenarios.The above simple analysis makes the case that the core needs for electrolysis are that next-generation technologies:(1)be relatively inexpensive and thus not use large amounts of precious metals (although low loadings may be acceptable),(2)have electrode, catalyst, and system designs that allow for intermittent operation without damage to the cell,(3)be able to operate with high efficiency given the high fraction of the cost electrical energy is to the output hydrogen, even at &#8764;$0.01 per kW&#183;h, and(4)must be durable for at least a decade or two under these conditions (recognizing that electrode/stack reconditioning may be much less expensive than building entirely new systems and enable operation for much longer).The contributions in this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the science and engineering research needed to overcome the challenges associated with green hydrogen and reach the cost levels where hydrogen is able to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions from large segments of the global economy.Several of the reviews deal with solid-oxide-based electrochemical technology. For example, Ming Chen's review provides analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which offer the highest efficiency (&#8764;36 kWh/kg) among all technologies because they operate at temperatures near 800 &#176;C, where thermodynamics favor efficient water splitting and the electrode kinetics are fast. (14) The review covers advances in SOEC component design&#9472;from electrodes to electrolytes&#9472;and discusses strategies for mitigating performance degradation over time, which is a major issue today with this technology. Challenges, such as stack scalability, cost, and system durability, are addressed, with recommendations for future research focused on enhancing reliability and reducing capital costs. Eranda Nikolla's review focuses on solid-oxide cells (SOCs), particularly those that can switch between fuel-cell and electrolyzer modes. (15) SOCs are relevant in the context of green hydrogen because they can efficiently convert renewable electricity into hydrogen during times of surplus and generate power from hydrogen when energy demand peaks, both with much higher thermodynamic efficiency than possible in lower temperature (&lt;100 &#176;C) systems. The review highlights significant degradation of electrocatalytic materials under dynamic conditions, such as switching between modes or handling multiple fuel types, and identifies the bottlenecks in catalytic performance due to effects such as sintering, poisoning, and undergoing phase transitions, and provides guidelines for designing stable, efficient electrode catalysts.Other reviews discuss materials and processes for low temperature electrolysis systems that rely on liquid water and either alkaline or acidic electrolytes. Paul Kempler's review focuses on the role of gas bubbles generated during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in electrolysis. (16) Gas evolution impacts the overall efficiency of electrolyzers by blocking active catalytic sites, increasing electrical resistance, and disrupting fluid dynamics at the electrode surface. The review discusses techniques for characterizing gas evolution in real time and optimizing electrode designs to enhance gas removal at high current densities. Effective bubble management is particularly essential for liquid alkaline electrolysis technology that has been historically limited to lower current densities (&lt;0.5 A cm&#8211;2) and constant current operation, but where innovation could enable dynamic operation and higher currents (&#8764;1&#8211;2 A cm&#8211;2) at high efficiency. The review identifies key strategies, such as tailoring electrode surfaces and structure to promote gas transport and bubble detachment. Managing gas evolution directly impacts the operational efficiency of electrolyzers, particularly at the high currents needed to reduce capital expense.Dirk Henkensmeier's review focuses on another key component for alkaline water electrolysis&#9472;the separator and/or membrane between the anode and cathode. (17) The review traces the historical evolution from asbestos-based diaphragms to polymeric composite diaphragms and the possibility to employ anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which offer improved conductivity and safety but are not yet fully proven stable for commercial application. Challenges in balancing the trade-offs between conductivity, membrane lifetime, and operational costs are discussed highlighting recent developments in ion-solvating membranes and improvements in AEM durability in strong hot alkaline solutions through chemical structure design. Thinner separators with lower ionic resistance that can effectively separate the evolved hydrogen and oxygen under varying load are central to lower the capital cost of the liquid alkaline electrolysis through higher current density while maintaining high efficiency.Travis Jones's review provides a detailed review of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and their fundamental mechanisms, focusing on the challenges involved in understanding and modeling multiple electron transfers and bond-forming/breaking steps. (18) The review traces the evolution of OER models, from early phenomenological approaches to modern ab initio simulations that incorporate electric fields, solvent effects, and explicit reaction kinetics. Jones explores how these models compare with experiment and identifies areas where key work is needed to bridge theory and practice. Because the OER is one of the major sources of inefficiency in low-temperature water-electrolysis technology, these understandings are central to designing electrodes with better activity and durability without resorting to high mass loading of expensive precious metals (in the case of proton-exchange membrane, PEM, electrolysis technology).Laurie King's review addresses an important challenge facing PEM electrolysis technology, the use of precious metals. (19) PEM electrolyzers offer perhaps the most-compelling performance metrics, but remain more expensive. Emerging alkaline membrane electrolyzer systems also tend to use precious metal cathodes. (20) The review highlights alternative catalyst materials, including molybdenum disulfides (MoS2), nickel&#8211;molybdenum alloys, phosphides, and carbides, with a focus on their stability and performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, reducing dependence on expensive precious metals, such as platinum, used in hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. King also evaluates metrics for measuring HER activity and stability, offering insights into best practices for catalyst testing under real-world conditions.Jeffrey Dick's review focuses on single-entity electrocatalysis, an emerging field that investigates the catalytic behavior of individual nanoparticles, atomic structures, or molecules. (21) Traditional studies measure the performance of catalysts as ensembles, where the activity of many particles is averaged. Dick's review highlights the experimental challenges of studying single entities, such as the development of new measurement tools and techniques capable of probing individual particles in real-time. Case studies discussed in the review include hydrogen evolution, carbon-dioxide reduction, and hydrazine oxidation, each demonstrating how single-entity studies can uncover new insights into catalyst behavior that ensemble measurements cannot capture. This approach is useful in future catalyst design and targeted improvements in the catalyst nanopowders and nanostructures used in electrolyzer electrodes.Returning to foundational understanding, Yuanyue Liu's review explores the potential of atomistic modeling to accelerate the discovery of high-performance catalysts for green hydrogen production. (22) This review focuses on addressing the complexity of electrochemical interfaces, which involve interactions between dynamic catalysts, electrolyte ions, solvent molecules and electrode surfaces. Liu discusses techniques to model solvation effects, electrode potentials, reaction kinetics, and pH. The review also highlights computational spectroscopy methods, which can bridge the gap between theory and experiment by offering molecular-level insights into mechanisms.Aliaksandr Bandarenka's review provides an in-depth review of the electrical double layer (EDL)&#9472;the critical region of molecular dimensions that forms at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, where ions accumulate, large electric fields exist, and solvent and other molecular species have properties very different than those of their bulk counterparts. (23) The review explores experimental techniques and theoretical models used to assess double-layer capacitance and ion interactions at electrochemical interfaces. Bandarenka emphasizes the influence of electrode composition, electrolyte chemistry, temperature, and pressure on EDL behavior, providing insights for optimizing catalysts and improving the efficiency and durability of electrochemical systems.Finally, Haiyang Yu and Zhiliang Zhang's review addresses perhaps one of the most critical issues for green hydrogen systems: hydrogen embrittlement, a phenomenon in which hydrogen atoms penetrate metallic structures, degrading their mechanical strength and causing cracks or fractures under stress. (4) This degradation is particularly dangerous for pipelines, tanks, and equipment used in hydrogen transport, storage, and processing. With green hydrogen production expected to scale rapidly, hydrogen embrittlement poses a significant threat to infrastructure reliability and safety particularly for any repurposed infrastructure from the natural gas industry. The review discusses how hydrogen interacts with different metals&#9472;steels, nickel alloys, and aluminum alloys&#9472;commonly used in energy infrastructure. Yu and Zhang explore the behavior of high-entropy alloys, the use of additive manufacturing to produce materials resistant to embrittlement, and the need for AI-driven predictive models to assess material performance and forecast failures. Reliable and predictable materials are central to hydrogen pipelines and storage facilities deployment at scale.The reviews presented in this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews collectively address some of the key science and engineering challenges associated with green-hydrogen production. From fundamental research on catalysts and materials to applied studies on electrolysis systems and gas-evolution, these contributions reflect some, but certainly not all, of the breadth of innovation required to realize the potential of green hydrogen. With work, green hydrogen is poised to be a cornerstone in the global energy transition.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorShannon W.

Increasingly, many propose using carbon capture and storage to reduce these emissions, producing so-called "blue hydrogen," frequently promoted as low emissions. We undertake the first effort in a peer-reviewed paper to examine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of blue hydrogen accounting for emissions of both carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane. Far from being low carbon, greenhouse gas emissions from the prodn. of blue hydrogen are quite high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. For our default assumptions (3.5% emission rate of methane from natural gas and a 20-yr global warming potential), total carbon dioxide equiv. emissions for blue hydrogen are only 9%-12% less than for gray hydrogen. While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture. Perhaps surprisingly, the greenhouse gas footprint of blue hydrogen is more than 20% greater than burning natural gas or coal for heat and some 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat, again with our default assumptions. In a sensitivity anal. in which the methane emission rate from natural gas is reduced to a low value of 1.54%, greenhouse gas emissions from blue hydrogen are still greater than from simply burning natural gas, and are only 18%-25% less than for gray hydrogen. Our anal. assumes that captured carbon dioxide can be stored indefinitely, an optimistic and unproven assumption. Even if true though, the use of blue hydrogen appears difficult to justify on climate grounds. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3MXhslKltrzL&amp;md5=a039b5ef4489e2eba5c08725ea4802074Yu, H.; D&#237;az, A.; Lu, X.; Sun, B.; Ding, Y.; Koyama, M.; He, J.; Zhou, X.; Oudriss, A.; Feaugas, X.; Zhang, Z.

(Cell Press) A review. The United States electricity grid is undergoing rapid changes in response to the sustained low price of natural gas, the falling cost of electricity from variable renewable resources (which are increasingly being paired with Li-ion storage with durations up to &#8764;4 h at rated power), and state and local decarbonization policies. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chem. storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to &#8764;3 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;100 h), &#8764;7 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;50 h), or &#8764;40 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technol. classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochem., thermal, and mech., are briefly ed. This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-d. storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXnslemtbw%253D&amp;md5=7d8b498c5c80d2a97d401187faec698a9Tong, D.; Farnham, D.

                quality was proposed. This model revealed favorable lithofacies in deltaic sand bodies could form lithologic traps, which have important exploration and development value for lithologic hydrocarbon reservoirs.proposed an improved stacked model with a gate network module to predict the permeability of tight sandstone reservoirs. The GNS model can automatically evaluate the impact of various logging parameters and significantly improve the prediction accuracy, which helps to enhance the reliability of tight reservoir evaluation parameters.He et al. established a data-driven fracture propagation model and fracture channeling identification method, successfully explains the reason for cross-well fracture channeling, and its conclusion aligns with the actual monitoring results.Shi et al. proposed a method to characterize the regional distribution of complex multi-layer migration pathways for oil and gas in the paleo-slope zone outside petroliferous basins' source kitchens. This study established a method creatively for determining the threshold for oil and gas migration along sandbodies and faults, and it improves the exploration efficiency of petroleum in areas with similar geological conditions like eastern basins in China.Zhang et al. study the dynamic loss process and the molecular changes of hydrocarbons in preserved shale samples exposed in open air for different time, and reveal that there is a large amount of oil loss of about 42% to 78% for samples with maturity %Ro between 1.01 and 1.53. The oil loss is mainly contributed by free oil, while adsorbed oil remains unchanged. NMR T1-T2 mapping can be an important method to estimate in-situ fluid saturation without sample crushing.Dong et al. employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) to analyze the descriptive topological and geometric features of carbonate samples from the Gaoshitti-Moxi area of the Sichuan Basin, compared the corresponding experimental results, and developed a novel comprehensive characterization approach for its parameters, which is conducive to characterizing the pore structure of carbonate rock.Zhou et al. characterized the source rocks and the structural evolution history is restored by using 2D-Move software. The characteristics of reservoirs and caps are clarified, and the controlling factors of reservoir formation are summarized. The sandstone reservoir has fracture and dissolution porosity, which provide storage space for oil accumulation. Faults and unconformities provide pathways for oil migration. The dense basalt is a good cap layer to preserve the reservoir. The research results are of great significance to guide future oil and gas exploration in the Liaohe Basin.Li et al. revealed the main controlling factors of reservoir heterogeneity in the Jiaxian area through thin rock sections, scanning electron microscopy, high-pressure mercury intrusion, and conventional property analysis. The multi-stage metamorphic hydrocarbon expulsion process in coal seams enriched the organic-inorganic interactions in coal-bearing strata, adding some reservoir capacity.Zhang et al. proposed a new method for dynamic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing of shale gas by borehole-to-surface Transient Electromagnetic Methods (BSTEM). By combining field-based shale gas fracturing monitoring models, the response patterns of the borehole-to-surface transient electromagnetic field under different fracturing stages are analyzed, which can guide importance for the application of borehole-to-surface transient electromagnetic methods in monitoring hydraulic fracturing of shale gas.Wang et al. constructed a three-dimensional model using hydraulic fracturing software based on the discrete lattice theory and synthetic rock mass method. The effect of a relatively short cluster spacing (5 m or less) on fracture propagation behavior was investigated through a series of case studies, considering operational parameters (injection rate, the number of fractures) and reservoir parameters (reservoir Young's modulus, stress anisotropy, principal stress direction).Wang et al. employed a well-seismic fusion method, incorporating RGB seismic attribute fusion technology, to classify and detail the sedimentary architecture of thin-layer beach-bar sand bodies in Niger's G oilfield. By integrating seismic attributes and well-logging data, it identifies the spatial distribution and connectivity of sand bodies, presenting a comprehensive architecture classification. These findings enhance the fine characterization of thin-layer beach-bar reservoirs, supporting efficient reservoir development and offering an important methodological reference for similar geological settings.He et al. explored the necessity of switching from water injection to natural gas injection in the fault-controlled fracture-cavity reservoir in Shunbei. They studied the optimization of natural gas injection parameters and methods, analyzed the natural gas displacement mechanism, optimized well pattern layout and injection-production parameters, and constructed an evaluation system for natural gas injection. This improves reservoir development efficiency and oil production rate, reduces the risk of gas channeling, and provides technical support for oil and gas field development.Li et al. based on a systematic study of the noble gas and stable isotope characteristics of normally-pressured shale gas samples, revealed the origin of noble gas from normally-pressured shale gas reservoirs and discussed the accumulation and expulsion mechanisms of normally-pressured shale gas in the tectonically complex margin of the southeastern Sichuan Basin. The result can provide insights into the enrichment mechanism of shale gas reservoirs and the prediction of shale gas production capacity in other structurally complex regions of the world.Wang et al. analyzed the Carboniferous Dawuba and Cambrian Niutitang shales in the Upper Yangtze Platform, South China, revealing their paleoenvironmental conditions and gas potential. Dawuba shales formed in warm, arid, reducing conditions, while Niutitang shales experienced cooler, arid climates. Both have high gas generation potential, with Dawuba featuring Type II2 kerogens and Niutitang Type I. Despite low gas content, promising exploration areas include the Qiannan Depression's Shangyuan and Zongdi regions.Fu et al. investigated the influence of extensional strike-slip fault systems on hydrocarbon accumulation in the Bohai Bay Basin's Huanghekoudong and Miaoxi'nan sub-sags. Utilizing three-dimensional seismic data, new sequence stratigraphic frameworks, and advanced analysis techniques, they develop a model detailing how these systems shape sub-sag evolution and trap formation. This research enhances understanding of structural trapping dynamics, providing crucial insights for exploration strategies in similar geological settings globally.Yuan et al. proposed a method for the identification of complex lithology of tight marl reservoir based on logging data. Lithological identification of 2D and 3D plots is established using sensitive GR, DEN, and RT. Corresponding identification standards are built in two hierarchies. The lithological characteristics of vertical, horizontal, and plane are discussed in the research area, which may aid in understanding the complex marl reservoir in the Leikoupo Formation 32 Submember of the Sichuan Basin, China.Meng et al. found that the factors that influence the CO 2 injectivity are CO 2 injection rate, reservoir pressure, formation water saturation, and permeability, respectively. The oil recovery is mainly influenced by CO 2 injection rate and formation permeability, and the influences of reservoir pressure and water saturation on oil recovery are smaller. To improve the CO 2 injectivity, the threshold values for radial perforation and fracture half-length are 25 m and 50 m. The different provenance controls the distribution of sedimentary facies in the vertical and lateral directions, which in turn controls the spatial distribution of the grain size and clastic composition. The study of provenance analysis and sediment transport can integrate tectonics, climate, provenance lithotypes, transport dynamics, and burial diagenesis, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of unconventional reservoirs. Wang et al. studied the seasonal deltaic deposits in the Cretaceous red bed of the Tarim Basin. As seasonal deltaic deposits were still not well studied in previous research, a concept depositional model about seasonal deltaic deposits was proposed in this research. This model revealed different types of distributary channels in Cretaceous arid paleoclimate, which have important value for both delta sedimentology and deltaic hydrocarbon reservoir exploration. Lan et al. used the Jurassic asphalt found in the QD1 well, combined with the source rocks of drilling cores and outcrops, and explored the possible hydrocarbon source and forming process in the Ruoqiang Sag using oil-source correlation and hydrocarbon accumulation geochronology methods. Peng et al. analyzed beach-bar reservoirs in Qinghai Lake, NW China, linked to unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. It highlights the influence of lake-level fluctuations, wind wave dynamics, sediment provenance, and terrain gradient on beach bar formation and morphology. Large-scale fluctuations set initial conditions, while small-scale ones refine features. Wind dynamics define depth zones, affecting morphology. Beach bars are categorized by sediment provenance: bedrock, alluvial fan, and braided river systems. Terrain gradients under 0.7 degrees favor formation, aiding hydrocarbon exploration and sedimentary geology. Wang et al. spectral analysis and wavelet transform are used to study the high frequency Milankovitch sedimentary cycle in Fengcheng Formation. A high resolution astronomical age scale is established, and the 2-stage sedimentary cycle and 8-layer sweet spot are identified. Qi et al. take the Chang 6 lobate delta in the Wuliwan area of the Jing'an Oilfield in the Yishan Slope of the Ordos Basin as an example, this study sets parameters including sediment grain size, hydraulic conditions, and slope gradient similar to those underground to simulate the evolution of the shallow-water delta in the research area through flume experiments, dissect its internal configuration characteristics, establish a sedimentary model, and provide guidance for water flooding adjustments in the oilfield. Dong et al. based on the observation and description of drilling cores, carbon and oxygen isotope tests, inclusion analysis, logging data analysis, and seismic data interpretation, they depict the filling architecture, analyze the stages of collapse-filling, and discuss the differential evolution process and associated filling mechanism of typical paleounderground rivers.Machine learning and artificial intelligence are of great value to the research of unconventional reservoirs. Wei et al. presented a hybrid feature selection method that integrates hyperspectral data with machine learning for precise estimation of dolomite content in carbonate rocks. This non-destructive approach improves the accuracy of field-based mineral identification and facilitates more detailed geological surveys, offering practical significance for oil resource assessment and exploration.</description>

A broad range of topics are covered, among these, energy and biorelated research take center stage, with a significant number of papers dedicated to these fields. Given the diversity of the topics, it is challenging to single out individual contributions. Instead, I have approached this by analyzing the prevailing trends across the Forum.Energy research is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by advancements in catalysts, photocatalysts, batteries materials, and fabrication techniques. These breakthroughs are driving innovations in energy storage, harvesting, and conversion technologies, offering sustainable and efficient solutions for the future. Multifunction catalysts and photocatalysts materials are unlocking new potential in applications such as zinc&#8211;air batteries, hydrogen production, and water splitting. (1&#8722;4)Progress in advanced photovoltaic materials, including perovskites and photonic nanomaterials, is accelerating renewable energy technologies. Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion of low-grade heat into usable energy, whereas lightweight, flexible materials, such as 2D structures and thin-film polymers, are paving the way for scalable solar films and stretchable thermoelectric generators. (5&#8722;7)In biomaterials, different types of nanoparticles are revolutionizing cancer therapy, imaging, and biosensor technologies. Stimuli-responsive materials are employed for targeted drug delivery and advanced medical applications. Meanwhile, bioinks and 3D-printed biomaterials are driving breakthroughs in tissue engineering and wound healing, combining biocompatibility with functional properties to support regenerative medicine. (8&#8722;12)I would like to highlight a few noteworthy articles in key themes such as energy, catalysis, and device technologies. In a perspective, Xin et al. discuss nonconventional electrochemical reactions in rechargeable lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, addressing the challenge of unstable polysulfide intermediates. The authors review innovative strategies to enhance battery stability and performance, focusing on modifications to sulfur allotropes, electrolyte composition, and electrode design. (13) In a related study, Shi et al. investigate the nucleation mechanisms of lithium pits and their morphological evolution across large electrode areas. Their findings reveal that overpotential is inversely related to pit radius and exponentially related to nucleation rate, offering new insights for predicting and controlling surface area and roughness in lithium electrodes under various stripping conditions (Figure 2). (14)Figure 2Figure 2. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces Early Career Forum, showcasing energy-related research, including studies on lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries and lithium pit nucleation.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn the rapidly growing area of electronics, two particularly exciting fields&#9472;optoelectronic synapses and heat harvesting&#9472;are showcased. Xu and co-workers present an organic optoelectronic synapse with multilevel memory, enabled by gate modulation. It mimics synaptic plasticity with both volatile and nonvolatile states, transitioning between short-term and long-term plasticity through gate voltage and light exposure. The device offers program/erase current ratios and stability, making it a promising candidate for neuromorphic systems in image processing and memory retention (Figure 3A).
