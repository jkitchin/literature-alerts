                Abstract The development of new energy conversion and storage technologies has contributed to the widespread use of renewable energy. However, new methodologies for electrochemical energy storage systems remain to be developed. This study presents a facile, low-cost, scalable, and environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of nickel oxide (NiO) nanostructures by hydrothermal methods using lotus root extract. The different volumes of lotus root extract were tested on NiO nanostructures (sample 1, sample 2) using 1 mL and 2 mL amounts of the extract, respectively. Therefore, phytochemicals from lotus extract have influenced the surface morphology, crystal quality, optical band gap, electrical conductivity, and surface active sites of NiO nanostructures. Sample 2 of the NiO nanostructures was found to be highly active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and showed an overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a durability of 30 hours at 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, sample 2 of NiO has shown specific capacitance of 1503.84 F/g at 2 A/g as well as cycling stability over a period of forty thousand GCD cycles. The percentage specific capacitance retention were highly improved up to 100.6%. An asymmetric energy storage device has been constructed using NiO sample 2 as the anode electrode material, demonstrating excellent capacitance of about 700 F/g at 5 A/g. For the asymmetric supercapacitor device, a power density of 20000 W/kg and an energy density of 245 Wh/kg were obtained. In a study of cycling stability for 40000 GCD cycles, it was observed that the asymmetric device retained 96.86% of its specific capacitance. A significant contribution was made to the electrochemical performance of sample 2 of NiO by phytochemicals derived from lotus extract.</description>

Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, 51.0 mV dec&#8722;1, and 1624 A gIr&#8722;1 at 1.50 V in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77 V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains stable over 900 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations attribute the enhanced intrinsic activity to the broad distribution of the binding energy for OER intermediates on IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA, which breaks the linear scaling relationship and accelerates the OER process.</description>

      <title>Cascading Water Activation and Interfacial Lattice Oxygen over Nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 for Electrocatalytic Propylene Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202420780</link>

                Direct electrooxidation of propylene using water&#8208;oxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0 g/m2/h and 95% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated water activation on CuOx&#8208;MnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts and renewable electricity&#8208;driven route.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is crucial for sustainable energy solutions, focusing on energy harvesting, storage, and pollution control. Despite the development of various electrocatalysts, understanding the dynamic processes in electrochemical reactions is still limited, hindering effective catalyst design. In situ Raman spectra have emerged as a critical tool, providing molecular-level insights into surface processes under operational conditions and discussing their development, advantages, and configurations. This review emphasizes new findings at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, especially interface water molecule state, during the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in recent years. Finally, the challenges and future directions for in situ Raman techniques in electrocatalysis are discussed, emphasizing their importance in advancing understanding and guiding novel catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Tuning on Highly Dispersed Iridium on Antimony-Doped Tin Oxide with Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                In the present study, we used a simple and efficient microwave-assisted NaBH4 reduction method to generate unsupported and antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO)-supported metallic iridium nanoparticles (Ir-NPs). The effects of pretreatment on the support and iridium precursor oxidation state in two different salts (IrCl3&#183;nH2O and (NH4)2IrCl6) were investigated to produce efficient and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolysis. Electrocatalysts with an Ir loading of 40 wt % supported on pristine ATO and acid-treated ATO were synthesized, and the performance was compared with the unsupported, synthesized, and commercial electrocatalysts. The Ir-NPs loaded on the support surface with 98% reaction yield and narrow size distribution, while without the support, somewhat agglomerated Ir-NPs were generated. A strong metal&#8211;support electron interaction at the junction of the Ir support, promoting the electrocatalyst stability and activity, was achieved for the supported electrocatalysts obtained from both precursors. The best electrocatalyst has demonstrated an excellent OER activity of 597 A gIr&#8211;1 compared to that of 305 A gIr&#8211;1 for a commercial IrO2 benchmark and a high potentiodynamic accelerated stress test stability (OER activity retention: 76% compared to 31% for commercial IrO2). The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the prereaction strong adsorption of the iridium precursor on the support surface, resulting in postreaction highly dispersed small NPs over the support surface generating strong metal&#8211;support interaction at the junction of Ir-ATO.AT.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Cycling Zinc Sites Promote Ruthenium Oxide for Sub-Ampere Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c04485</link>
      <description>Meihuan Liu, Xiaoxia Chen, Shiyu Li, C.Y. Ni, Yiwen Chen, Hui Su, Nano Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405113290

                Although iridium-based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, their exorbitant cost and scarcity severely restrict their widespread application. Herein, we introduce a promising alternative to iridium: zinc-doped ruthenium dioxide (TE-Zn/RuO2), which exhibits remarkable and enduring activity for acidic OER. In situ characterizations elucidate that the dynamic cycling of zinc dopants serves as both electron acceptors and donors, facilitating the activation of Ru sites at low overpotentials while thwarting peroxidation at high overpotentials, thus concurrently achieving heightened activity and robust stability. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc induces weakened Ru&#8211;O covalency, thereby stabling *OOH intermediates and instigating a sustained adsorbate evolution mechanism, dramatically stabilizing the RuO2 lattice. Importantly, the TE-Zn/RuO2 catalyst as an anode exhibits good stability over 300 h at a water-splitting current of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 in the PEMWE device, underscoring its considerable promise for practical applications.</description>

                Achieving large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a key strategic direction in the energy revolution. However, the high potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and acidic environment seriously limit hydrogen production efficiency. RuO2&#8208;based catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their unique electronic structure and exceptional activity in the OER. Nevertheless, their durability remains insufficient for long&#8208;term PEMWE and hydrogen generation. This paper explores the fundamental causes of catalyst degradation and strategies to enhance catalyst stability under different reaction pathways. Additionally, the importance of PEMWE components, including bipolar plates and membrane electrode assemblies, in improving system stability and efficiency is emphasized, highlighting their role in large&#8208;scale applications of PEMWE. Looking forward, research efforts should prioritize the optimization of both catalysts and system components to achieve a balance between performance, cost, and long&#8208;term durability. By addressing these factors, we can unlock the full potential of PEMWE technology and make hydrogen a viable, large&#8208;scale solution for clean energy production.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Reduction of Kinetic Overpotential on Magnetic Electrocatalysts under Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4rlmq</link>

                The direct enhancement of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by a magnetic field is a novel strategy for high-efficiency alkaline water electrolysers. The influence of a magnetic field on either electrochemical equilibria or electron-transfer kinetics remains controversial, partially due to the difficulty of eliminating the mass-transfer related effects. In this work, a magneto-electrochemical system, which contains a thin-layer flow cell allowing a forced convection flow, is designed to decouple the magnetic effects on mass transfer from those on the reaction kinetics. When OER is catalyzed by magnetic materials, the active species on the surface, rather than the composition and magnetic property of the bulk material, determine the magneto-enhancement of the reaction kinetics. The enhancement at monometallic active sites follow the order Ni3+ &lt; Co3+ &lt; Fe3+, corresponding to the change in kinetic overpotential (&#916;Ek) of 2.7, 18.8, and 42.9 mV at 1 mA&#183;cm-2, respectively. It was assumed that a magnetic field acts on the spin moments of active sites, leading to variations in the d-band center and the electrochemical equilibria. Here we show that the magneto-enhancement follows the same trend of the average spin moments in the order Ni &lt; Co &lt; Fe. Thus, the spin state of active sites determines the &#916;Ek on magnetic electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The high overpotential and unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 &#8208;based catalysts seriously hinder their application in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a Ru@RuO 2 core/shell catalyst doped with atomically dispersed Mn species, denoted as Ru@Mn&#8208;RuO 2 , is reported, which is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot method. Detailed structural characterizations confirm that Mn is homogeneously and atomically distributed in RuO 2 shell, which causes lattice contraction of RuO 2 . The as&#8208;prepared Ru@Mn&#8208;RuO 2 exhibits a very low overpotential of 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and an excellent stability of 360 h, far surpassing the control samples Ru@RuO 2 without atomically dispersed Mn dopants and home&#8208;made RuO 2 nanoparticles without metallic Ru core. With the further assistance of density functional theory calculations, the enhanced OER activity of Ru@Mn&#8208;RuO 2 is attributed to multiple synergistic effects, including the MnO x &#8208;Ru (oxide shell) synergy, MnO x &#8208;Ru (metal core) synergy, and the Ru (core)&#8208;RuO 2 (shell) synergy. Besides, the atomically dispersed Mn doping can increase the formation energy of soluble Ru cations, thus leading to the excellent stability of the Ru@Mn&#8208;RuO 2 catalyst. This work shines light on the design of electrocatalysts with multiple synergistic effects towards efficient acid water splitting.</description>

                Bidirectional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are key for molecular oxygen-centric renewable energy transduction via metal-air batteries. Here, a molecular cobalt complex is covalently tethered on a strategically functionalized silica surface that displayed both ORR and OER in alkaline media. The detailed X-ray absorbance spectroscopy (XAS) studies indicate that this catalyst retains its intrinsic molecular features while playing a central role during bidirectional electrocatalysis and demonstrating a relatively lower energy gap between O</description>

                The synergistic electrochemical properties of a rational design transition metal oxide can improve its efficiency. However, the optimal synergistic effect of transition metal oxide nanostructures toward energy storage and conversion is still unsatisfactory. Herein, a simple, efficient wet chemical synthesis method is promoted for the incorporation of iron and cobalt ions into the nickel oxide matrix as (Fe&#8211;Co-doped NiO), with excellent high energy storage and electrocatalytic OER performance. Importantly, the correlation between varying amounts of Fe&#8211;Co-doped NiO electrodes and catalysts with different surface morphologies, crystallographic phases, and electrochemical activities was investigated. Benefiting from strong synergistic action, rich oxygen vacancies, oxidation behavior, transferred ion diffusion, and morphology, the 5 wt % Fe and Co-doped NiO electrode (5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;NiO) exhibit a better specific capacitance of 5419.3 F g&#8211;1 at a current density of 2 A g&#8211;1, which is better than that of the pristine NiO (530.4 F g&#8211;1). Similarly, a 5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;NiO//5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;NiO symmetric device provides a superb volumetric energy power density (47.9 Wh kg&#8211;1/545.8 WK g&#8211;1). It also demonstrates durable redox cycle life with 92.86% retention after 10,000 redox cycles scanned at a current density of 10 A g&#8211;1. At the same time, a panel consisting of 42 red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a voltage of approximately 1.5 V has been successfully illuminated for five min, exhibiting a high level of illumination intensity. This was accomplished by connecting two symmetric supercapacitor devices in series. This demonstrates the significance of the as-grown 5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co-doped NiO electrode for commercial applications. Furthermore, compared to the pristine NiO (680 mV and 146 mV s&#8211;1) catalyst, the 5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co&#8211;NiO electrocatalyst shows impressive intrinsic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2 and a small Tafel slope of 85.6 mV dec&#8211;1, approving the importance of bimetallic ion doping in water splitting activity. Additionally, the 5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co-doped NiO nanostructured catalyst presents the highest turn-on-frequency (1.64 s&#8211;1) and electrochemically active surface area (84.75 mF cm&#8211;2) values, thus indicating the specific efficacy of each active site. Also, a 5 wt % Fe&#8211;Co-doped NiO catalyst has maintained steady performance for more than 115 h. This work offers a deep understanding of the impact of optimal bimetallic doping through the synergistic effect on energy storage and water splitting performance of the NiO electrode/catalyst for commercial practices.</description>

                ABSTRACT As for the high sustainable solar hydrogen production via water splitting, transition metal doping on an oxide photoanode in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells has been recognized as an effective approach. However, conventional thermal&#8208;diffusion&#8208;mediated doping strategies face the challenge of resolving sluggish catalytic kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its practical utilization for the synthesis of photoanode films. Herein, we introduce facile ultrafast flame&#8208;boosted doping of Mo into a BiVO 4 (FL MoBVO) film for 20 s to achieve an efficient PEC OER. Mo elements in a low&#8208;valence state (i.e., Mo 6&#8722; &#948; ) and Mo 6+ are successfully doped into the photoanode, which manipulate the energy band structure, facilitating the downward shift of band edges and promoting the surface catalytic kinetics. Consequently, the flame&#8208;boosted Mo&#8208;doping results in superior PEC performance in a mild environment with neutral electrolyte without introducing any other additives or co&#8208;catalysts, where the photocurrent density at 1.23 V RHE under 1 sun illumination in pH 7 is outstandingly enhanced, over 9&#8208;fold higher than that of a pristine BiVO 4 . The flame&#8208;boosted doping induces significantly enhanced photoexcited charge transport and catalytic reaction kinetics performances simultaneously. Our report provides the effective strategy boosting both the thermodynamic and kinetic charge migration properties for sustainable materials.</description>

                Ni-Co-based oxides (Ni-Co-O) are promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their adaptable structures, affordability, abundance, and strong electrochemical performance. While various studies explored the structure-activity relationships and OER mechanisms in these catalysts, comprehensive anode development requires a systematic workflow covering all stages of catalyst optimization. Here, we present an integrated approach for characterizing commercial Ni-Co-O nanomaterials using a combination of analytics during processing, in operando, and post-catalysis to gain insights into parameters influencing anode performance. Key findings include the critical impact of catalyst ink optimization through solvent matrix screening, enabling high-quality electrode layers via ultrasonic spray coating on Ni plates. These Ni-Co-O layers, tested as anodes in alkaline OER, were further enhanced by plasma post-processing, resulting in binder-free surfaces with increased porosity and wettability compared to untreated samples. Notably, plasma treatment also promoted a more redox reversible catalyst structure, improved Fe uptake efficiency, and led to a significantly enhanced OER activity by reducing the overpotential by ~43 mV at 100 mA/cm&#178; compared to untreated samples. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic evaluation approach, from catalyst powder to post-mortem analysis, that enabled us to discover how plasma post-processing can yield binder-free electrodes with superior electrochemical properties.</description>

                Abstract Solar hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production has garnered increased research interest owing to its safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and sustainability. The synthesis of H 2 O 2 relies mainly on renewable resources such as water, oxygen, and solar energy, resulting in minimal waste. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) stands out among various oxide semiconductors for selective H 2 O 2 production under visible light via direct two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) pathways. Significant advancements have been achieved using BiVO 4 &#8208;based materials in solar H 2 O 2 production over the last decade. This review explores advancements in BiVO 4 &#8208;based photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 production, focusing on photocatalytic powder suspension (PS) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems, representing the main approaches for heterogenous artificial photosynthesis. An overview of fundamental principles, performance assessment methodologies, photocatalyst and photoelectrode development, and optimization of reaction conditions is provided. While diverse strategies, such as heterojunction, doping, crystal facet engineering, cocatalyst loading, and surface passivation, have proven effective in enhancing H 2 O 2 generation, this review offers insights into their similar and distinct implementations within the PS and PEC systems. The challenges and future prospects in this field are also discussed to facilitate the rational design of high&#8208;performing BiVO 4 &#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrodes for H 2 O 2 generation under visible light.</description>

                Abstract The NiFe&#8208;oxy/hydroxides (NiFeO x H y ) have emerged as promising candidates for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but suffer from irreversible metal dissolution to pose a great challenge to long&#8208;term stability. Here, a self&#8208;supported electrode of NiFeO x H y /FeNiO x /SS&#8208;A (substrate&#8208;etched stainless steel, SS&#8208;A; interlayer&#8208;amorphous Fe 3 Ni 1 O x oxide; catalytic layer&#8208;amorphous Ni 3 Fe 1 O x H y ) is fabricated and presents rare self&#8208;healing property of surface cracks, as well excellent activity and stability. It is found that crack repair is driven by the redeposition of dissolved Fe and Ni ions from the amorphous interlayer involved in the OER process because no similar behavior is observed in Fe&#8208;free and crystalline interlayer&#8208;supported NiFeO x H y . Moreover, the repair performance is dependent on current density and electrolysis time, with 71% of surface cracks being repaired after 72 h operated on an industrial level of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 . It needs to be emphasized that the irreversible dissolution of Fe and Ni from the catalytic layer of NiFeO x H y still occurs but is effectively suppressed. It is demonstrated that the construction of an amorphous FeNiO x oxide interlayer in self&#8208;supported electrodes plays an important role in improving the stability and is expected to open up an opportunity for the design and develop highly efficient and durable alkaline OER catalytic electrodes.</description>

                Abstract Rutile RuO 2 is recognized for its outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and notable cost advantage compared to iridium oxide for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, the unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 hinders its practical application. Here, we report a lattice modulation strategy to enhance both the OER activity and stability of RuO 2 . Interestingly, the newly synthesized Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 &#8208;RuO 2 , with Mo doped first and then Nb, presents the greatest lattice spacing and possesses an overpotential of merely 205 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which significantly outperforms Nb 0.05 Mo 0.15 &#8208;RuO 2 (239 mV), where Nb was doped first followed by Mo, as well as the initial RuO 2 (323 mV). Remarkably, Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 &#8208;RuO 2 requires only 1.76 V to achieve 1 A cm &#8722;2 and exhibits exceptional stability in PEMWE testing, with a voltage rise of only 58 mV at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 for more than 80 h.</description>

                Abstract Spin configuration and coordination environment changes have emerged as promising strategies to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, achieving the precise and gradual regulation of both spin states and coordination environment to elucidate the structure-activity relationship remains a key priority and is rarely reported. In this work, we successfully induce the gradual transition of spin states of Fe sites from low spin state to a medium spin state and ultimately to high spin state by meticulously adjusting coordination environment within NiFe-MOF, while the Ni sites still keep a low spin state. Experimental and theoretical calculations confirm the precise regulation of spin polarization and electrons migration from the Fe-t2g to the Fe-eg orbitals with a reduced coordination saturation, which optimizes the spin orbital exchange interactions between Fe and Ni ions and facilitates adsorption of reaction intermediates. The NiFe-MOF-D3 with unique NiO6-FeO4 geometric structure exhibits low overpotential of 328 mV@1 A cm-2 and 365 mV@1.5 A cm-2 in alkaline medium. Furthermore, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer also presents remarkable activity (1.77 V@500 mA cm-2) and lower cost ($ 0.94) than the target of U.S. Department of Energy ($ 2.00).</description>

                Abstract Developing stable and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting is essential for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. In this work, CuBP microparticle clusters (MPCs) electrocatalyst is demonstrated on a Ni foam substrate, fabricated by using a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal approach followed by post&#8208;annealing treatment. The optimized CuBP electrode exhibits impressive activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), showing overpotentials of 49 and 220 mV at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH, which are comparable to benchmark Pt/C and RuO 2 electrodes. The bifunctional CuBP achieves a cell voltage of 1.52 V at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 , outperforming the Pt/C||RuO 2 systems and also demonstrating excellent stability over 120&#8208;h operations. At 2000 mA cm &#8722;2 , a voltage of 3.12 V is required in CuBP||CuBP configuration whereas the hybrid Pt/C||RuO 2 design exhibits a significantly lower cell voltage of 2.25 V at 2000 mA cm &#8722;2 . The superior catalytic behavior of the CuBP electrode can be attributed to the high active surface area due to the micro&#8208;particle topology, the optimal balance of Cu, B, and P, and the enhanced conductivity achieved through vacuum annealing. Overall, the CuBP electrode is highly efficient and has significant potential to replace traditional RuO&#8322; electrodes.</description>

      <title>Thin Nickel Coatings on Stainless Steel for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution and Reduced Iron Leaching in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>

      <description>Yashwardhan Deo, Niklas Thissen, Vera Seidl, Julia Gallenberger, Julia Hoffmann, Jan P. Hofmann, Bastian J. M. Etzold, Anna K. Mechler, Electrochemical Science Advances. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405202960

                ABSTRACT One of the most mature technologies for green hydrogen production is alkaline water electrolysis. However, this process is kinetically limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Improving the OER kinetics requires electrocatalysts, which can offer superior catalytic activity and stability in alkaline environments. Stainless steel (SS) has been reported as a cost&#8208;effective and promising OER electrode due to its ability to form active Ni&#8208;Fe oxyhydroxides during OER. However, it is limited by a high Fe&#8208;to&#8208;Ni ratio, leading to severe Fe&#8208;leaching in alkaline environments. This affects not only the electrode activity and stability but can also be detrimental to the electrolyzer system. Therefore, we investigate the effect of different Ni&#8208;coatings on both pure Ni&#8208; and SS&#8208;supports on the OER activity, while monitoring the extent of Fe&#8208;leaching during continuous operation. We show that thin layers of Ni enable enhanced OER activities compared to thicker ones. Especially, a less than 1 &#181;m thick Ni layer on an SS&#8208;support shows superior OER activity and stability with respect to the bare supports. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals traces of oxidized Fe species on the catalyst surface after OER, suggesting that Fe from the SS may be incorporated into the layer during operation, forming active Ni&#8208;Fe oxyhydroxides with a very low Fe leaching rate. Utilizing inductively coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy, we prove that thin Ni layers on SS decrease Fe leaching whereas the Fe from the uncoated SS&#8208;support dissolves into the electrolyte during operation. Thus, OER active and stable electrodes can be obtained while maintaining a low Fe concentration in the electrolyte. This is particularly relevant for application in high&#8208;performance electrolyzer systems.</description>

                Mixed-metal nickel-iron, NixFe materials draw attention as affordable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here nickel and mixed-metal nickel-iron metal-organic framework (MOF) composites with the carbon materials ketjenblack (KB) or carbon nanotubes (CNT) were synthesized in situ in a one-pot solvothermal reaction. As a direct comparison to these in situ synthesized composites, the neat MOFs were postsynthetically mixed by grinding with KB or CNT, to generate physical mixture composites. The in situ and postsynthetic MOF/carbon samples were comparatively tested as (pre-)catalysts for the OER and most of them outperformed the RuO2 benchmark. Depending on the carbon material and metal ratio the in situ or postsynthethic composites performed better, showing that the method to generate the composite can influence the OER activity. The best material Ni5Fe-CNT was synthesized in situ and achieved an overpotential (&#951;) of 301 mV (RuO2 &#951; = 354 mV), a Tafel slope (b) of 58 mV/dec (RuO2 b = 91 mV/dec), a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 7 &#8486; (RuO2 Rct= 39 &#8486;) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95% (RuO2 FE = 91%). Structural changes in the materials could be seen through a stability test in the alkaline electrolyte and chronopotentiometry over 12 h showed that the derived electrocatalysts and RuO2 have a good stability.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal&#8208;based tellurides (TMTs) with excellent electrical conductivity are expected to be ideal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. However, compared to transition metal sulfides and selenides, the reported applications of TMTs in overall water splitting are fewer. Herein, the NiTe/FeTe/Fe 3 O 4 /FF carnation flower&#8208;like with a semi&#8208;coherent interface is successfully constructed to enhance the electrochemical overall water splitting performance. Specifically, it achieves low overpotentials of 54 and 176 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. What's more, the electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.5 V to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains remarkable stability for an extensive duration of 450 h even at a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Semi&#8208;coherent interface engineering and vacancy engineering not only improve the OH&#8315; adsorption capacity of catalysts but also promote the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen (H ads ). In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that FeOOH and NiOOH formed by NiTe/FeTe/Fe 3 O 4 /FF during the OER are the genuine active sites. This study provides a promising approach for the electrochemical water splitting of TMTs by combining semi&#8208;coherent interface engineering and vacancy engineering.</description>

                Abstract This study reports an effective strategy for designing 3D electrocatalyst via the deposition of ZIF67&#8208;derived Co&#8211;CN shell layer over CuO nanoarrays to form a CuO@Co&#8211;CN hybrid, followed by incorporation with p &#8208;block Sb single atoms (CuO@Co&#8211;CN/Sb) to obtain highly activated catalytic behaviors. Inheriting both the excellent intrinsic catalytic activity of the components and their synergy, the CuO@Co&#8211;CN/Sb material serves as a high&#8208;efficiency multifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting and zinc (Zn)&#8211;air batteries. The material yields a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 72 and 250 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Furthermore, an electrolyzer based on CuO@Co&#8211;CN/Sb shows remarkable performance with a derived current density of 0.5 A cm &#8722;2 at low cell voltage of 2.67 V and good stability for 50 h continuous operation at a high current density of 0.5 A cm &#8722;2 . Simultaneously, Zn&#8211;air battery using the CuO@Co&#8211;CN/Sb material as air cathode yields a high open circuit voltage of 1.455 V and a discharge power density of 131.07 mW cm &#8722;2 .</description>

                Abstract Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the alternative glycerol electro&#8208;oxidation reaction (GER) provides a promising strategy to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production via water electrolysis while co&#8208;generating high&#8208;value chemicals. However, obtaining low&#8208;cost and efficient GER electrocatalysts remains a big challenge. Herein, a self&#8208;supported N&#8208;doped Co 2 NiO 4 nanoflakes (N&#8208;Co 2 NiO 4 NF) is proposed for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol to formate. The synergistic effect induced by the interaction of the layered Co 2 NiO 4 nanostructures on the 3D&#8208;printed Nickel&#8208;Yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (Ni&#8208;YSZ) substrate and the amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doping promotes the anodic GER. The N&#8208;Co 2 NiO 4 NF exhibits low potentials of 1.07 and 1.18 V ( vs . RHE) for GER to drive 10 and 50 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. The constituted two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer (N&#8208;Co 2 NiO 4 NF//NiS&#8208;Co&#8208;NiP) displays excellent activity that only requires ultralow cell voltages of 1.24 and 1.55 V to afford 10 and 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively, with a high FE (97%) for formate production and an excellent durability (120 h). This study provides a versatile approach for manufacturing high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based electrocatalyst for GER, paving the way for the energy&#8208;saving and environmentally&#8208;friendly co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen.</description>

  Evolution Reaction (OER) in Fe-doped Copper Oxide (CuO) Catalysts</title>

                Although hydrogen generation by water electrolysis is the cheapest of all other available sources, water splitting still occurs with sluggish kinetics. It is a challenging barrier for H2 production on a large scale. Moreover, research is still underway to understand the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and design the catalysts with improved OER performance. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and OER performance of iron-doped copper oxide (CuO) as low-cost catalysts for water oxidation. The OER occurs at about 1.49 V versus the RHE with a Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH solution. The overpotential of 338 mV at 10 mA/cm2 is among the lowest compared with other copper-based materials. The catalyst can deliver a stable current density of &gt;10 mA/cm2 for more than 10 hours. Additionally, wastewater treatment, particularly synthetic dye wastewater, is vital for preventing water scarcity and adverse effects on human health and ecotoxicology. The as-synthesized catalysts are also utilized for Fenton-like photo-degradation under low-power visible household LED lights toward the most commonly industrially used simulated Methylene blue dye wastewater. Almost complete degradation of the MB dye has been achieved within 50 minutes of visible light irradiation with a first-order rate constant of 0.0973/min. This dual functionality feature can open new pathways as a non-noble, highly efficient, and robust catalyst for OER and wastewater treatments.</description>

                Oxygen redox chemistries at high voltage have materialized as a revolutionary paradigm for cathodes with high-energy density; however, they are plagued by the challenges of labile oxygen loss and rapid degradations upon cycling, even after concerted endeavors from the research community. Here we propose a multi-concentration stratagem propelled by entropy reinforcement to enhance the electronic structure disorder (ESD) at high desodiation states for impeding undesired oxygen mobility and ensuring controlled oxygen activity, elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The increased disorder strengthens the reversible electrochemistry of lattice oxygen redox, leading to effectively suppressed P-O structural evolution and highly stable localized TMO6 octahedral environments, as demonstrated by soft/hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, we reveal that a high-entropy state induced by cationic disordering has capacity to perturb cationic redox boundaries, significantly restraining the formation of detrimental P3' phases. As a consequence, the high-voltage cycling stability has been greatly enhanced, up to 4.4 V versus Na+/Na, with an impressive 90.1% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles and 76.1% capacity retention at 2C over 300 cycles. The resilient oxygen redox, enabled through the control of ESD, broadens the horizons for entropy engineering and lays the foundation for advancements in high-energy, long-cycling, safe batteries.</description>

                Abstract A promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy cathode material, LiNiO 2 (LNO) has failed to realize commercialization due to severe capacity degradation during cycling. The dual mechanisms of surface oxygen evolution due to anion redox and anisotropic volume change upon delithiation synergistically pulverize and degrade the material. Detailed Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling and analysis of the anisotropic structural changes associated with crack formation in LiNiO 2 (LNO) reveals the link of mechanical behavior to charge transfer and oxygen redox activity upon deep charge cycling (&gt;4.2 V vs Li/Li + ). In the two&#8208;phase region and H2&#8211;H3 transition from 66% to 100% delithiation, oxygen of [NiO 6 ] octahedra is discovered to undergo redox in growing the Li&#8208;deficient regions, causing c&#8208;lattice mechanical weakening and collapse as the Li&#8208;slab becomes depleted. Li&#8208;site dopants are investigated to locally compensate against anion redox, resulting in enhanced coulombic repulsion and supporting the interslab layer thickness even at 100% depth of charge. Ionic size and oxidation state of M in Li x&#8208;y M y NiO 2 are found to fundamentally impact stabilization capability, moderating the anisotropic strain and volume expansion asynchronously. Optimization of mixed doping composition may then enable &#8220;zero strain&#8221; high&#8208;Ni Li(Ni,Co,Mn)O 2 (NCM) or LNO.</description>

      <description>Lei Zhu, Xiao&#8208;Jing Sang, Peng Zhao, Jiansheng Li, Sifan Li, Hao Dong, Xin Zhou, Meiying Liu, Wan&#8208;Sheng You, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405261426

                The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver-based electrocatalysts (Ag-x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver-based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag-10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm-2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag-10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (-111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag-O-O-Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.</description>

                Metal phosphate-type compounds have been utilized in diverse applications, and their distinctive chemical properties have recently opened avenues for their use as catalysts. Metal phosphates have previously demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical water splitting. However, the critical factors influencing OER electrocatalysis on Ni-based phosphates have been insufficiently explored. We herein demonstrate nickel (Ni)-based phosphates-monoclinic Ni</description>

                Extended hydrogen initiatives promote the urgency of research on water splitting technologies and therein oxygen evolution reaction catalysts being developed. A route to access a ZrF4 supported high-entropy fluoride catalyst using a facile sol-gel route is presented. The high-entropy character of the catalyst was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) as well as inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Additional investigations on the local structure were performed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. The catalyst shows significant potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media with a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at approximately 1.60 V, thus outperforming benchmark materials such as IrO2, despite a significant reduction in electrochemical mass loading. A potential mechanism is suggested based on free energy calculation using DFT calulations.</description>

                Optimizing the composition and structure of nanocatalysts is an efficient approach to achieving the top electrocatalytic performance. However, the construction of hollow nanocomposites composed of metal phosphides and highly conductive carbon to promote the electrocatalytic performance of metal phosphide-based catalysts is rarely reported. Herein, a CoFeP/C nanobox nanocomposite consisting of Co-Fe mixed-metal phosphides and N-doped carbon was successfully fabricated through an ion-exchange phosphidation strategy derived from ZIF-67 nanocubes. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between multiple components and the unique hollow structure, CoFeP/C nanoboxes can catalyze the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high activity and stability. Furthermore, in the construction of an alkaline water electrolyzer using CoFeP/C nanoboxes as both OER and HER catalysts, they were capable of efficiently splitting water with a current density of 10 mA cm</description>

                Abstract Noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts are impractical for large&#8208;scale manufacture due to their high cost, limited availability, and poor long&#8208;term stability in performing several functions. Hence, an alternative is the need of the hour that emphasizes blending metals and ceramic property materials with compelling electroconductivity. In this research, we synthesized two bare materials, Nb 2 AlC MAX (Nb&#8208;MX) phase and graphitic carbon&#8208;nitride (GCN) sheets using the calcination method which is then converted into a composite (Nb&#8208;MX/GCN) material through wet impregnation technique. The electrochemical investigations were conducted to assess the catalytic efficacy of the composite material. The synthesized Nb&#8208;MX/GCN electrocatalyst exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic efficiency for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment. The catalyst exhibits a significantly low overpotential of just 66 mV and 450 mV for the HER and OER performance, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in a 1.0 M KOH solution. In addition, the catalytic activity exhibited no change over 24 h which indicated the excellent stability of the material. This performance surpassed the previously reported electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electrolyte pH in Additive&#8208;Free NiFe Catalyst Electrodeposition for Electro&#8208;Catalytic OER Applications</title>

                Abstract This study presents the correlation between electrolyte pH, surface morphology, chemical speciation and electro&#8208;catalytic oxygen evolution activity of additive&#8208;free electrodeposited NiFe catalysts for application in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis. Spherical morphologies were identified at pH 0, shifting towards honey&#8208;combed structures at pH 4 with increasing surface area, especially at pH 3. Further, the electrolyte pH was found to influence the NiFe composition and electro&#8208;catalytic activity. Enhanced OER activity was noted at pH 2 with overpotentials of 214 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and 267 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . The results reveal that the electrolyte pH is a parameter not only influencing the morphology but also tailoring the surface area, Fe oxide and Fe hydroxide composition and consequently the catalytic activity. Further, the outcomes highlight the electrolyte pH as a key process parameter that should be adjusted according to the application, and may substitute the addition of electrolyte&#8208;additives, proposing a simpler method for improving catalyst electrodeposition.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Electrocatalyst Degradation Testing by Accurate and Robust Forecasting of Multidimensional Kinetic Model with Bayesian Data Assimilation</title>

      <description>Miao Wang, Akimitsu Ishii, Ken Sakaushi, ACS Energy Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405193872

                Degradation tests represent a significant bottleneck in electrochemical technology development, occasionally requiring tens of thousands of hours. Thus, reliable degradation forecasting in a short time frame is a game-changer in accelerating the establishment of future electrochemical devices. Herein, we show a multidimensional kinetic model for electrocatalyst degradation by quantifying the relationship among potential, current, and time, applicable under various conditions. Aiming to predict reliable degradation behaviors in shorter experimental timeframes and inspired by modern weather forecasting methods, we integrated Bayesian data assimilation with our model to expedite multidimensional parameter optimization. Consequently, we achieved accurate and robust forecasting of electrocatalyst lifetime by employing oxygen evolution reaction as a representative system: it takes just 300 h to obtain the final lifetime of close to 1000 h even with environmental noise. This data-driven approach can accelerate our understanding of the microscopic electrochemical mechanisms and simultaneously directly bridge this understanding to develop next-generation energy technologies.</description>

                Abstract Despite the great success in deploying metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as efficient electrocatalysts, the low adoption of operando methods hinders the understanding of underlying mechanism. By leveraging the subtle refractive index evolution, including both the real and the imaginary parts, an entirely new concept of a lab&#8208;on&#8208;fiber operando method and its feasibility for &#8220;pristine&#8208;immersion&#8208;operando&#8208;post analysis&#8221; of electrocatalyts are demonstrated. Concurrent collection of absorption spectra and surface plasmon resonance is achieved by engineering fiber&#8208;optic waveguides to simultaneously induce guided light attenuation and plasmonic coupling. In situ&#8208;formed Co hydroxide and oxide reactive intermediates in zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) electrocatalyst are optically identified, which shows its underlying self&#8208;reconstruction conversions at different stages during electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions, and address the gap in knowledge concerning whether ZIF&#8208;67 is a precatalyst for real catalyst production. This illuminating operando method offers intriguing opportunities to collect all the observables in a single fiber, provides an exciting potential of a new class of device with long&#8208;sought integration and miniaturization capability, and is expected to enable the electrocatalysis community to conquer challenges with conducting multimodal operando experiments outside the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Innovations and Challenges in Water Electrolysis for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55529/jeet.46.22.35</link>
      <description>Tanvir Haider, Zulfiqar Haider, Journal of Energy Engineering and Thermodynamics. None(46)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405208416

                Hydrogen is renewable, efficient energy carrier that can contribute to solve the climate change problem when paired with sustainable electricity and water electrolysis. While PEM electrolysis is outstanding in producing high purity of hydrogen, the AWE electrolysis has been Versatile in meeting several industrial purposes. AEM technology is considered as more cost effective than the existing technologies which uses highly costly metal catalysts such as Pt, Au, Ru, etc. However, water electrolysis which is a sustainable method for hydrogen production supplies only 4% of the global hydrogen due to high costs. Unfortunately, the use of precious metals constrains the prospect of scale-up; nevertheless, automation-based naked-metal electrocatalysts can be advanced as cost-effective yet conductive and electrocatalytically active solutions. But much more work has to be done to improve their characteristics and stability. In the context of this paper, the major developments and problems in water electrolysis are discussed based on the outlook for the effective and inexpensive catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. To this end, it seeks to overcome these barriers in order to provide direction to future studies and facilitate the development of cost-effective water electrolyzers for sustainable hydrogen generation.</description>

                ABSTRACT Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are ionic layered compounds characterized by anion&#8208;containing intermediate regions within positively charged brucite&#8208;like layers. LDHs have shown high electrochemical activity in energy conversion systems such as batteries and fuel cells. In this study, we developed a hierarchically porous nanostructure derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67, which was subsequently transformed into an LDH structure with varying Ni concentrations. We precisely controlled the Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Co ratio within the LDH structure and investigated how different mole fractions of Co and Ni influence catalytic activity and selectivity for the electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR). LDH structures with low Ni content (up to 40%) demonstrated high activity and selectivity for O 2 due to their structural instability and the predominant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) originating from ZIF&#8208;67. In contrast, LDHs with high Ni content (over 60%) supressed OER and exhibited enhanced activity for UOR. The resulting hollow structure with an expanded electrochemically active surface in LDHs with high Ni content could improve mass transport and diffusion at the electrode interface, leading to better reaction kinetics and higher current densities. These findings provide a foundational design guideline for metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived nanostructure in UOR. image</description>

      <title>Interface Electron Transfer Direction&#8208;Tuned Urea Electrooxidation Over Multi&#8208;Interface Nickel Sulfide Heterojunctions</title>

                Abstract Hydrogen can be produced by electrolyzing urea aqueous solution under smaller overpotentials, owing to the lower thermodynamic potential of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) at anode than oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The efficient and selective electrocatalysts for UOR are crucial to achieve this. Herein, two NiS&#8208;based NiS/Ni 3 S 2 and NiS/NiS 2 heterojunctions with Ni cores embedding in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NiS/Ni 3 S 2 &#8208; and NiS/NiS 2 &#8208;Ni@NCNT) are demonstrated as efficient UOR electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic UOR performance over heterojunctions is efficiently tuned by altering the electron transfer direction on their interfaces. NiS/Ni 3 S 2 &#8208;Ni@NCNT with interface electrons transferring from Ni 3 S 2 to NiS, delivers a 10 mA cm &#8722;2 UOR current density in 1.0 m KOH with 0.5 m urea at 1.37 V, superior to NiS/NiS 2 &#8208;Ni@NCNT with the electron transfer direction from NiS to NiS 2 . Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that NiS/Ni 3 S 2 Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunctions facilitate the rapid in situ formation of NiOOH active species by removing electrons of Ni 3 S 2 , and also accelerate the adsorption and conversion of urea molecules and key intermediates of * CON 2 at its interfaces. This work demonstrates an interface electron transfer direction tuning strategy on heterojunctions for harvesting high&#8208;performance UOR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Constructing Highly Porous Low Iridium Anode Catalysts Via Dealloying for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202409386</link>
      <description>Jiashun Liang, Cehuang Fu, Sooyeon Hwang, Chaochao Dun, Liuxuan Luo, Zulipiya Shadike, Shuiyun Shen, J. Zhang, Hui Xu, Gang Wu, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405083952

                Abstract Iridium (Ir) is the most active and durable anode catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, their large&#8208;scale applications are hindered by high costs and scarcity of Ir. Lowering Ir loadings below 1.0 mgcm &#8722;2 causes significantly reduced PEMWE performance and durability. Therefore, developing efficient low Ir&#8208;based catalysts is critical to widely commercializing PEMWEs. Herein, an approach is presented for designing porous Ir metal aerogel (MA) catalysts via chemically dealloying IrCu alloys. The unique hierarchical pore structures and multiple channels of the Ir MA catalyst significantly increase electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and enhance OER activity compared to conventional Ir black catalysts, providing an effective solution to design low&#8208;Ir catalysts with improved Ir utilization and enhanced stability. An optimized membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with an Ir loading of 0.5 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 generated 2.0 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.79 V, higher than the Ir black at a loading of 2.0 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 (1.63 A cm &#8722;2 ). The low&#8208;Ir MEA demonstrated an acceptable decay rate of &#8776;40 &#181;V h &#8722;1 during durability tests at 0.5 (&gt;1200 h) and 2.0 A cm &#8722;2 (400 h), outperforming the commercial Ir&#8208;based MEA (175 &#181;V h &#8722;1 at 2.0 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 ).</description>

      <title>Ecogeographic body size clines in turtles: analysis and synthesis of pattern and process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/blae108</link>
      <description>C. K. Yang, John B. Iverson, Joshua R. Ennen, Njal Rollinson, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. 143(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405251489

                Abstract The mechanisms underpinning the evolution of ectotherm body size across temperature and latitude remain an enduring mystery. Oxygen limitation in warmer aquatic environments is often invoked to explain steeper temperature&#8211;size relationships of aquatic species across latitude, but the role of aquatic environments on body size evolution of aquatic species that respire primarily in air is unclear. We tested the generality of intraspecific temperature&#8211;size responses in Testudines, assessing whether turtles generally follow Bergmann&#8217;s Rule, and whether aquatic versus terrestrial turtles exhibit different temperature&#8211;size responses. Using a global dataset of turtle body sizes, we found that turtles generally show decreasing body size with increasing temperature. However, we also found that aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial turtles respond similarly to temperature. Our study affirms the possibility that temperature&#8211;size relationships are driven partly by oxygen limitation in other ectotherms, but casts doubt on hypotheses related to oxygen limitation for groups that respire primarily in air. We formalize and explore a hypothesis that temperature&#8211;size responses in turtles are a result of heat balance, arguing small size in warm environments reduces overheating risk, and large size in cool environments minimizes heat loss. Ultimately, we provide new insight and direction in the study of ecogeographic clines.</description>

      <title>Nutrient-rich spatial refuges buffer against extinction and promote evolutionary rescue in evolving microbial populations</title>

                Microbial populations are often exposed to long-term abiotic disturbances, which can reduce population viability and cause local extinction. Eco-evolutionary theory suggests that spatial refuges can facilitate persistence and evolutionary rescue. However, one drawback of spatial refuges is reduced exposure to nutrients such as carbon and oxygen, suggesting the protective effect of refuges depends on the interplay between environmental conditions and the degree of stress. Here, we test this general idea using mathematical modelling, and experimental evolution of the model bacterium</description>

                The link between the chemistry of the protoplanetary disk and the properties of the resulting planets have long been a subject of interest in the effort to understand planet formation. These connections have generally been made between mature planets and young protoplanetary disks through the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. In a rare number of systems, young protoplanets have been found within their natal protoplanetary disks. These systems offer a unique opportunity to directly study the delivery of gas from the protoplanetary disk to the planet. In this work we post-process 3D numerical simulations of an embedded Jupiter-mass planet in its protoplanetary disk to explore the chemical evolution of gas as it flows from the disk to the planet. The relevant dust to this chemical evolution is assumed to be small co-moving grains with a reduced dust-to-gas ratio indicative of the upper atmosphere of a protoplanetary disk. We find that as the gas enters deep into the planet's gravitational well, it warms significantly (up to $ 800$ K), releasing all of the volatile content from the ice phase. This change in phase can influence our understanding of the delivery of volatile species to the atmospheres of giant planets. The primary carbon, oxygen, and sulphur carrying ices (CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and H$_2$S) are released into the gas phase and along with the warm gas temperatures near the embedded planets lead to the production of unique species such as CS, SO, and SO$_2$ compared to the protoplanetary disk. We compute the column densities of SO, SO$_2$, CS, and H$_2$CS in our model and find that their values are consistent with previous observational studies.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of O,F Co-Modified g-C3N4 for Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity Improvement and Corrosion Protection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst14121063</link>
      <description>Shiyu Zhou, Pei Li, Chunbo Zhang, Yang Wang, Jingting Hu, Ruokun Jia, Crystals. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405195974

                Herein, we report the rational synthesis of porous g-C3N4 co-modified with oxygen (O) and fluorine (F) for the first time. Incorporating colloidal SiO2 during thermal polymerization introduces lattice oxygen, forming C&#8211;O bonds, while post-treatment with NH4&#183;HF2 establishes C&#8211;F bonds. The dual incorporation of O and F elements extends visible light absorption and effectively promotes the separation and transport of photoexcited charge carriers. Consequently, the co-modified g-C3N4 (O,F-g-C3N4) achieves a 13.2-fold increase in H2 evolution rate compared to pristine g-C3N4. This synthesized O,F-g-C3N4 is then dispersed in waterborne polyurethane (WPU) to create an anti-corrosive coating for Q235 carbon steel substrates. Water resistance, mechanical property, and electrochemical characterization analyses reveal that the O,F-g-C3N4/WPU composite coating exhibits remarkable corrosion resistance with a high protection efficiency of 90.23%. This work offers a straightforward approach for developing highly efficient g-C3N4-based photocatalysts and corrosion-resistant coatings.</description>

      <title>Evolving massive stars to core collapse with GENEC: Extension of equation of state, opacities, and effective nuclear network</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202451816</link>
      <description>Adam Griffiths, M. &#193;. Aloy, Rapha&#235;l Hirschi, Moritz Reichert, M. Obergaulinger, Emily E. Whitehead, S&#233;bastien Martinet, Luca Sciarini, Sylvia Ekstr&#246;m, G. Meynet, Astronomy and Astrophysics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405055206

                Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 $M_ odot $ will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements, at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron capture, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes, and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgraded the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it covers the regime of high-temperatures and high-densities required to produce the progenitors of core-collapse. Our ultimate goal is producing pre-supernova models with GENEC, not only right before collapse, but also during the late phases (silicon and oxygen burning). We have improved GENEC in three directions: equation of state, the nuclear reaction network, and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero age main sequence masses of $15M_ odot $, $20M_ odot $, and $25M_ odot $ at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies, and impacts explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with the potential for further dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Resistive Switching Dynamics by Controlling Phase and Self&#8208;Assembled Nanochannels in HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                Abstract A resistive switching device with precise control over the formation of conductive filaments (CF) holds immense potential for high&#8208;density memory arrays and atomic&#8208;scale in&#8208;memory computing architectures. While ion migration and electrochemical switching mechanisms are well understood, controlling the evolution of CF remains challenging for practical resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) deployment. This study introduces a systematic approach to modulate oxygen vacancies (OV) in HfO 2 films of Ag/HfO 2 /Pt&#8208;based RRAM devices by controlling the substrate temperature. At 300 &#176;C, the HfO 2 film exhibits a dominant monoclinic phase with maximum OV concentration, which plays a key role in achieving optimal multilevel resistive switching behavior. Self&#8208;assembled nanochannels in the HfO 2 films guide CF evolution, and the diffusion of Ag at inside these films suggests a synergistic interplay between OV and Ag&#8314; ion migration for reseting the voltage&#8208;controlled resistive states. This approach addresses the endurance/retention trade&#8208;off with an impressive R on /R off ratio of &#8776;8000 while demonstrating growth temperature&#8208;driven OV modulation as a tool for multi&#8208;bit data storage. These findings provide a blueprint for developing high&#8208;performance oxide&#8208;based RRAM devices and offer valuable insights into multilevel resistive switching mechanisms, paving the way for future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation study on the mechanism of plasma dissociation of carbon dioxide in atmospheric pressure packed-bed reactors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7498/aps.74.20241241</link>
      <description>Yi Peng, Chunjing Wang, Jing Li, K. Gao, Han Xu, Chuan-Jie Chen, Muyang Qian, Bingyan Dong, Dezhen Wang, Acta Physica Sinica. 74(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405263325

                The streamer propagation and electric field distribution in a two-dimensional fluid model of a packed bed reactor (PBR) filled with carbon dioxide are comprehensively studied by utilizing the PASSKEy simulation platform in this work. The spatiotemporal evolution of electron density, electric fields and key plasma species in the discharge process are studied in depth. The PBR with layered dielectric spheres is simulated by using the model, indicating that the inner sides of the first layer and the second layer of dielectric spheres are not the main regions for reactions such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation; instead, the main regions are along the streamer propagation path and the outer side of the first layer of dielectric sphere. In this work, the propagation of streamers in an electric field is investigated, highlighting the influence of anode voltage rise and dielectric polarization on local electric field enhancement. This enhancement leads the electron density and temperature to increase, which facilitats streamer propagation and the formation of filamentary microdischarges and surface ionization waves. This work provides a detailed analysis of the local electric field evolution at specific points within the PBR, and a further investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of spatial and surface charges, revealing that negative charges concentrate in the streamer and on the dielectric surface, with density being significantly higher than that of positive charges. The positive charge distribution is closely related to the streamer path, and with time going by, the charge distribution becomes dominated in the discharge space. This work also explores the surface charge deposition on the dielectric spheres, and discusses the evolution trend of the distribution. Additionally, this work discusses the temporal and spatial evolution of key plasma species, including ions and radicals, and their contributions to the overall discharge characteristics. The production mechanisms of carbon monoxide particles, carbon dioxide ions, and oxygen ions are analyzed, with a focus on their spatial distribution and correlation with electron density. Finally, the energy deposition within the PBR is examined by integrating the spatial energy deposition of electrons and major positive ions. The results indicate a total energy deposition value of approximately 1.428 mJ/m, with carbon dioxide ions accounting for 8.8% of this value.</description>

                Abstract Giant viruses (GVs; Nucleocytoviricota) impact the biology and ecology of a wide range of eukaryotic hosts, with implications for global biogeochemical cycles. Here, we investigated GV niche separation in highly stratified Lake A at the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. This lake is composed of a layer of ice-covered freshwater that overlies saltwater derived from the ancient Arctic Ocean, and it therefore provides a broad gradient of environmental conditions and ecological habitats, each with a distinct protist community and rich assemblages of associated GVs. The upper layer (mixolimnion) had measurable light and oxygen, and contained diverse GVs linked to photosynthetic protists, indicating adaptation to surface biotic and abiotic conditions. In contrast, the saline lower layer (monimolimnion), lacking oxygen and light, hosted GVs associated with predicted heterotrophic protists, some of which are known for a predatory lifestyle, and with several viral genes suggesting adaptation to deep-water anaerobic conditions. Our observations underscore the coupling between physical and chemical gradients, microeukaryotes and their associated GVs in Lake A, and provide insight into the potential for GVs to directly and indirectly impact host metabolism. There were similarities between the genetic composition of GVs and the metabolic processes of their potential hosts, implying co-evolution and niche-adaptation within the lake habitats. Notably, we found a greater presence of viral rhodopsins in deeper water layers, suggesting an evolutionary relationship with potential hosts capable of supplementing their energetic needs to thrive in low energy, anoxic conditions.</description>

                Understanding the structure evolution of nanoalloys under reaction conditions is vital to the design of active and durable catalysts. Herein, we report an operando measurement of the dynamic lattice strains of dual-noble-metal alloyed with an earth-abundant metal as a model electrocatalyst in a working proton-exchange membrane fuel cell using synchrotron high-energy X-ray diffraction coupled with pair distribution function analysis. The results reveal an interfacial reaction-triggered oscillatory lattice strain in the alloy nanoparticles upon surface dealloying. Analysis of the lattice strains with an apparent oscillatory irregularity in terms of frequency and amplitude using time-frequency domain transformation and theoretical calculation reveals its origin from a metal atom vacancy diffusion pathway to facilitate realloying upon dealloying. This process, coupled with surface metal partial oxidation, constitutes a key factor for the nanoalloy's durability under the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction condition, which serves as a new guiding principle for engineering durable or self-healable electrocatalysts for sustainable fuel cell energy conversion.</description>

      <title>High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) Reinforcement of Amorphous Materials: A Pathway to Superior Wear and Corrosion Resistance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.13111/2066-8201.2024.16.4.4</link>
      <description>Emilia DOBRIN, Alin Constantin Murariu, INCAS BULLETIN. 16(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405108337

                The escalating demand for advanced structural materials with superior wear and corrosion resistance in aeronautical and military applications has spurred interest in amorphous alloys, particularly metallic glasses, due to their non-crystalline atomic configurations and exceptional mechanical properties. High-Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) spraying, a high-performance thermal spray technology, has emerged as a robust solution for enhancing the surface integrity of these materials by delivering dense, well-bonded coatings. This study investigates the integration of HVOF in reinforcing amorphous materials, with a specific focus on augmenting wear resistance under extreme mechanical stresses and improving corrosion protection in hostile environments. Key parameters such as particle velocity, flame temperature, and spray distance are analyzed to optimize coating quality while preserving the amorphous phase. The article delves into the microstructural evolution during deposition, assessing the resultant performance improvements through empirical data and computational models. Findings indicate that HVOF reinforcement significantly enhances the operational longevity of amorphous materials, positioning them as viable candidates for high-stress, corrosive conditions in military aviation, defense systems, and aerospace components.</description>

                Red supergiants may lose significant mass through steady winds and episodic eruptions in the final 100-1000 years before the core collapses, shaping their circumstellar environment. Interaction between supernova (SN) ejecta and distant circumstellar material (CSM) can generate shocks, which can energize the ejecta and serve as a key power source during the nebular phase of the SN. In the present work, we investigate the nebular spectrum of SN 2023ixf, observed one year post-explosion (at +363 d) with the recently commissioned WEAVE instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. This marks the first supernova spectrum captured with WEAVE. In this spectrum, H$\alpha$ exhibits a peculiar evolution, flanked by blueward and redward broad components centred at $\sim\pm 5650\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the rest velocity of H$\alpha$, which are seen for only a few SNe to date. These features indicate energy deposition from shocks generated by the interaction of ejecta with a CSM expelled nearly 350 $-$ 640 years pre-explosion. Comparisons of the +363 d spectrum with model spectra from the literature, that include varying shock powers, suggest a shock power of at least $\sim 5 \times 10 ^{40}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ at this epoch. Additionally, analysis of the [O I] doublet, along with other prominent emission lines, provides evidence for clumpiness, dust formation, and asymmetry within the ejecta and/or the surrounding CSM. These emission lines also helped to constrain the oxygen mass ($\approx0.19^{\scriptscriptstyle +0.08}_{\scriptscriptstyle -0.04} M_\odot$), He-core mass ($&lt;3 M_\odot$) and the zero-age main sequence mass ($\lesssim 12 M_\odot$) of the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. The comparison with other Type II SNe highlights SN 2023ixf's unique shock interaction signatures and evidence of dust formation, setting it apart in terms of evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>C/O ratios in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with dust evolution</title>

                Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\,Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation and advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase C/O$\approx0.2-0.3$ between the CO, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.</description>

                We present numerous aspects of the evolution of the LP 890-9 (SPECULOOS-2/TOI-4306) planetary system, focusing on the likelihood that planet c can support life. We find that the host star reaches the main sequence in 1 Gyr and that planet c lies close to the inner boundary of the habitable zone. We find the magma ocean stage can last up to 50 Myr, remove 8 Earth-oceans of water, and leave up to 2000 bars of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, if the planet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water will be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape processes. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion resonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal dissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of mantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require more than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach hundreds of terawatts. We thus conclude that the habitability of planet c depends most strongly on the initial volatile content and internal properties, but no data yet preclude the viability of an active biosphere on the planet.</description>

                ABSTRACT Polymer&#8208;derived SiOC materials are widely regarded as a new generation of anodes owing to their high specific capacity, low discharge platform, tunable chemical/structural composition, and good structural stability. However, tailoring the structure of SiOC to improve its electrochemical performance while simultaneously achieving elemental doping remains a challenge. Besides, the lithium storage mechanism and the structural evolution process of SiOC are still not fully understood due to its complex structure. In this study, a hollow porous SiOCN (Hp&#8208;SiOCN) featuring abundant oxygen defects is successfully prepared, achieving both the creation of a hollow porous structure and nitrogen element doping in one step, finally enhancing the structural stability and improving the lithium storage kinetics of Hp&#8208;SiOCN. In addition, the formation of a fully reversible structural unit, SiO 3 C&#9472;N, through the chemical interaction between N and Si/C, showcases a strong lithium adsorption capacity. Taking advantage of these combined benefits, the as&#8208;prepared Hp&#8208;SiOCN electrode delivers a reversible specific capacity of 412 mAh g &#8722;1 (93% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g &#8722;1 and exhibited only 4% electrode expansion. This work offers valuable mechanistic insights into the synergistic optimization of elemental doping and structural design in SiOC, paving the way for advanced developments in battery technology.</description>

                Abstract The early evolution of eukaryotes and their adaptations to low-oxygen environments are fascinating open questions in biology. Genome-scale data from novel eukaryotes, and particularly from free-living lineages, are key to answering these questions. The Parabasalia are a major group of anaerobic eukaryotes that form the most speciose lineage of Metamonada. The most well-studied are parasitic parabasalids including Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus, but very little genome-scale data is available for free-living members of the group. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of Pseudotrichomonas keilini, a free-living parabasalian. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that P. keilini possesses a metabolism and gene complement that are in many respects similar to its parasitic relative Trichomonas vaginalis, and that in the time since their most recent common ancestor, it is the Trichomonas vaginalis lineage that has experienced more genomic change, likely due to the transition to a parasitic lifestyle. Features shared between P. keilini and Trichomonas vaginalis include a hydrogenosome (anaerobic mitochondrial homologue) that we predict to function much as in Trichomonas vaginalis, and a complete glycolytic pathway that is likely to represent one of the primary means by which P. keilini obtains ATP. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that P. keilini branches within a clade of endobiotic parabasalids, consistent with the hypothesis that different parabasalid lineages evolved towards parasitic or free-living lifestyles from an endobiotic, anaerobic or microaerophilic common ancestor.</description>

      <title>Geological and experimental evidence of bioavailable phosphite during the Great Oxygenation Event</title>

                Abstract Phosphorus (P) availability throughout geologic time has likely impacted the co-evolution of life and Earth&#8217;s environments. Phylogenetic data suggest that phosphate was the primary P-source for microbial life during the Archean, but phosphite, a reduced form of P, became relatively more important leading up towards the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) in the Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic. However, seawater phosphite concentrations during this time, and the potential processes driving this shift in P utilization, are unknown. Here, we performed laboratory experiments simulating the precipitation of banded iron formations (BIFs) as hydrous ferric oxyhydroxides (HFO) in deionized water, diluted seawater, and seawater containing phosphate and phosphite. We also measured phosphite concentrations in BIF samples from four Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic formations. Our results indicate a weaker removal of phosphite compared to phosphate by HFO irrespective of solution chemistry. Paired with measurements of phosphite (up to 0.05&#8211;250 ppm) in BIFs, we estimate that seawater phosphite concentration at the onset of the GOE could have reached up to 0.01&#8211;0.17 &#181;M. We propose that the preferential removal of phosphate relative to phosphite by HFO, coupled with microbial competition for P facilitated by oxygenic photosynthesis, might have created phosphate-depleted environments, prompting life to exploit alternative P sources such as phosphite.</description>

      <title>Deepening the understanding of wreck ecology: a comparative study of marine sediment microbiomes across 10 Maltese wreck sites</title>

                The anthropogenic influences of historical shipwrecks on the marine environment remain largely uncharacterized, particularly for wrecks located at depths of ~50 meters and lost over 80 years ago. Below 50 meters, the marine environment transitions from the euphotic to the mesophotic zone, where reduced light, significant changes in oxygen levels, and increased pressure may alter microbial communities and metabolic pathways. Understanding these shifts can provide insights into the adaptation and evolution of microorganisms. Sediment samples were collected by a team of divers from nine wreck sites off the coast of Malta, varying in depth from 5 to 100 meters. All sampling was conducted with the consent and authorization of the Government of Malta for the collection of marine genetic resources. Chemical analyses and metabarcoding techniques were employed to assess how shipwrecks influence microbial diversity and community composition in the surrounding sediments. Alpha ( &#945; ) diversity of microbial communities was higher in sediments adjacent to the shipwrecks compared to those collected over 100 meters away from any wreck site. Across all nine wreck sites, sediment size emerged as the most significant driver of microbial diversity, followed by frame type and the presence of oil leaks. This study demonstrates that shipwrecks, varying in depth, frame type, and country of origin, significantly influence the microbial ecosystems and sediment chemistry of their surrounding environment. The findings suggest that shipwrecks act as focal points for ecological and chemical changes, contributing to the dynamic interactions between historical artifacts and marine ecosystems.</description>

      <title>The ones that got away: Chemical tagging of globular cluster-origin stars with gaia BP/RP spectra</title>

                Abstract Globular clusters (GCs) are sites of extremely efficient star formation, and recent studies suggest they significantly contributed to the early Milky Way&#8217;s stellar mass build-up. Although their role has since diminished, GCs&#8217; impact on the Galaxy&#8217;s initial evolution can be traced today by identifying their most chemically unique stars&#8212;those with anomalous nitrogen and aluminum overabundances and oxygen depletion. While they are a perfect tracer of clusters, be it intact or fully dissolved, these high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] GC-origin stars are extremely rare within the current Galaxy. To address the scarcity of these unusual, precious former GC members, we train a neural network (NN) to identify high-[N/O], high-[Al/Fe] stars using low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra. Our NN achieves a classification accuracy of approximately $\approx 99~{{\%}}$ and a false positive rate of around $\approx 7~{{\%}}$, identifying 878new candidates in the Galactic field. We validate our results with several physically-motivated sanity checks, showing, for example, that the incidence of selected stars in Galactic GCs is significantly higher than in the field. Moreover, we find that most of our GC-origin candidates reside in the inner Galaxy, having likely formed in the proto-Milky Way, consistent with previous research. The fraction of GC candidates in the field drops at a metallicity of [Fe/H]&#8776;&#8722;1, approximately coinciding with the completion of spin-up, i.e. the formation of the Galactic stellar disk.</description>

                Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown. &#160;Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that&#160;may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 &#8211; Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22&#176; 45&#8217;,158&#176; W), and along a transect from 22&#176; 45&#8217; to 31&#176; N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021.&#160; Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 &#8211; 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32&#8211;38) toward the gyre centre at 31&#176; N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn (4&#8211;8 &#181;M C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5&#8211;3 &#181;M C)&#160; and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5&#8211;20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to &lt;10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22&#8211;67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.</description>

      <title>Understanding and optimizing Li substitution in P2-type Sodium Layered Oxides for Sodium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7x9sm</link>

                In the quest for novel cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, we studied a family of Li-substituted P2 layered oxides with nominal stoichiometry Na5/6LiyNi5/12-3y/2Mn7/12+y/2O2 (y = 2/18, 3/18, 4/18, 5/18). We explored the consequences of Li substitution, as well as the challenge of elevating the Na content in the pristine materials through solid-state synthesis. By in situ temperature-resolved x-ray diffraction (XRD) we observed the synthesis process, clearly showing the formation of an intermediate Li2MnO3 structure with increasing Li content. Structurally, honeycomb ordering is observed in all samples, while we show that Li induces the loss of Na+/vacancy ordering hence it leads to more disordered Na positions. Electrochemically, this family of materials exhibits an increasing trend of polarized hysteresis in the first cycle, suggesting the contribution of oxygen redox. We coupled semi-simultaneous operando x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and XRD to appreciate the structural evolution and redox behavior during this process. We verified that Li in the transition metal site eliminates phase transitions at high voltage and modifies the activation of O-redox. As confirmed by our XANES analysis and by Density Functional Theory calculations, the Li-free sample already surprisingly show anionic redox despite the residual availability of Ni-redox, due to the peculiar density of states dominated by Ni-O hybridized states at high state of charge. On the other hand, Li-containing samples have O non-bonding states that lead to increasing O-redox contribution as expected due to the limited Ni content. One composition (Na0.745(6)Li0.164(4)Ni0.238(1)Mn0.599(3)O2) proves to have the lowest proportion of O-redox among all samples, coupled with reduced phase transitions, disordered occupancy of Na sites, and small volume change during cycling (4.8%). This material hence delivers the best balance of cycling stability (&#8764;92% after 100 cycles in half cells), capacity (&gt; 100 mAh/g) and rate capability. Determining this optimal compositional range is a promising starting point for further development of P2 layered oxides as cathode materials for Na-ion batteries and can be generalized to other families of Na-based layered oxides with redox-inactive dopants.</description>

However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 &#8211; Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22&#176; 45&#8217;,158&#176; W), and along a transect from 22&#176; 45&#8217; to 31&#176; N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021.&#160; Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 &#8211; 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32&#8211;38) toward the gyre centre at 31&#176; N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn (4&#8211;8 &#181;M C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5&#8211;3 &#181;M C)&#160; and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5&#8211;20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to &lt;10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22&#8211;67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.</description>
