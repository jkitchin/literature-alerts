The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Tensile straining of iridium sites in manganese oxides for proton-exchange membrane water electrolysers</title>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

      <title>TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF ELECTROLIZERS FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6036/10907</link>
      <description>Pierfrancesco Molina, Francisco Montero&#8208;Chac&#243;n, J.J. Brey, Dyna. 99(1)] 2024.
Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

      <title>The electrocatalytic self-reconstruction of ultrathin 2D MOF nanoarrays supported on alloy foam improves the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.133136</link>
      <description>Tao Ren, Jia Wang, Xinhui Yu, Yi Chen, Yuanyuan Wu, Bo Yu, Wei Jiang, Honghui Teng, Chunbo Liu, Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects. None(None)] 2024.
Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

      <title>Observing Long-lived Photogenerated Holes in Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-14dr7</link>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

      <title>Recent advances and perspective on transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for efficient electrochemical water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cnl2.105</link>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost. Future prospects include exploring new materials and optimizing the preparation methods to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Plasma&#8208;Engineering of Oxygen Vacancies on NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Nanowires with Enhanced Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Performance for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;air Battery</title>

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

      <title>Nickel Nanoparticles Protruding from Molybdenum Carbide Micropillars with Carbon Layer-Protected Biphasic 0D/1D Heterostructures for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c15769</link>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of a highly active &#946;-PbO2-Co3O4 electrode for zinc electrowinning by pulse electrodeposition: Characterization and catalytic performance analysis</title>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode.

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Surface Reconstruction of FeOOH/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Redistribution via Anionic Modulator for Superb and Highly Stable Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07364</link>

Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost.

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

      <title>The electrocatalytic self-reconstruction of ultrathin 2D MOF nanoarrays supported on alloy foam improves the oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

      <title>Recent advances and perspective on transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for efficient electrochemical water splitting</title>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost. Future prospects include exploring new materials and optimizing the preparation methods to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.</description>

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

      <title>Atomically dispersed catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical water splitting: from catalyst design, performance to catalytic mechanism</title>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024.
In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

      <title>Atomically dispersed catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical water splitting: from catalyst design, performance to catalytic mechanism</title>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

      <title>A Self-Supporting Electrode Material (NiS/NF) as a Stable and Efficient Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution: &lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Surface Activation of Nickel Sulfide to Nickel Oxide/(Oxy)hydroxide</title>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

      <title>Nano&#8208;Au&#8208;decorated hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide derived from ZIF&#8208;67 toward optimized oxygen evolution catalysis: Important roles of microstructures and electronic modulation</title>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>
