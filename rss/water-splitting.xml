      <title>Lattice Strain with Stabilized Oxygen Vacancies Boosts Ceria for Robust Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Outperforming Benchmark Pt</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202405970</link>

                Abstract Earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides are usually considered as stable but catalytically inert towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unfavorable hydrogen intermediate adsorption performance. Herein, a heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual&#8208;doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy is proposed to boost CeO 2 towards robust alkaline HER. The induced lattice compression and increased oxygen vacancy (O v ) concentration in CeO 2 synergistically improve the water dissociation on O v and sequential hydrogen adsorption at activated O v &#8208;neighboring sites, leading to significantly enhanced HER kinetics. Meanwhile, Y doping offers stabilization effect on O v by its stronger Y&#8722;O bonding over Ce&#8722;O, which endows the catalyst with excellent stability. The Y,Co&#8208;CeO 2 electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low HER overpotential (27 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and Tafel slope (48 mV dec &#8722;1 ), outperforming the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst. Moreover, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporated with Y,Co&#8208;CeO 2 achieves excellent stability of 500 h under 600 mA cm &#8722;2 . This synergistic lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy sheds new light on the rational development of efficient and stable oxide&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts.

      <title>How to Break the Activity&#8208;Stability Conundrum in Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis: Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400567</link>

                Abstract Technically viable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) must be both active and stable under the harsh conditions at an electrolyser anode. While numerous highly active metal&#8208;oxide catalysts have been identified, only very few are sufficiently stable, with iridium oxides being the most prominent. In this perspective, we draw insights from OER mechanisms to circumvent the activity&#8208;stability conundrum generally plaguing the development of OER catalysts. In the commonly considered OER mechanisms, one or several metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8722;O) bonds are required to be broken along the OER pathway, providing a mechanistic link between the OER and oxide decomposition. However, a recently discovered mechanism on crystalline iridium dioxide provides a new OER pathway without M&#8722;O bond breakages, thus enabling the combination of sufficient activity and stability.</description>

      <title>Structure and oxygen evolution reaction performance of Ni-supported catalysts based on steam-exploded poplar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15376/biores.19.3.4886-4898</link>
      <description>Jing Yuan, Xiaofei Li, Feifan Wu, Peng Cheng, Haitao Yang, Bioresources. 19(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399565772

                Using renewable steam-exploded poplar (SEP) as carbon source, nickel metal doped carbon hybrid materials were designed to synthesize catalysts (Ni/SEP) with certain oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties and were compared with nickel catalysts supported on metal organic framework structure (ZIF67-Ni). The roles of SEP support in Ni-based catalyst were considered. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the fiber could better hinder the aggregation of metal particles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) indicated the presence of surface OH groups after the reduction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the major form of metallic Ni in the resulting Ni catalysts. Carbon materials as carriers, the synergetic effect of Ni-doped, and carbon carrier played an important role in facilitating the kinetics of OER, which was similar to the carrier of metal-organic frame material. Notably, the Ni/SEP (11.3 mF/cm-2) and ZIF67-Ni (37.2 mF/cm-2) with better OER performance exhibited a smaller double layer capacitances (Cdl), suggesting the intrinsic OER catalytic activity of the Ni/SEP and ZIF67-Ni were much higher in comparison to the ZIF67-Ni/SEP. Moreover, the inferior performance of Ni/SEP further indicated that the synergistic effect between carbon and Ni/NiO contributes to the enhanced OER activity.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409449</link>
      <description>Jian Zhou, Liang Xu, Huiyu Gai, N. Xu, Zhichu Ren, Xianbiao Hou, Zongkun Chen, Zhongkang Han, Debalaya Sarker, Sergey V. Levchenko, Minghua Huang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399575217

                The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Through an artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d&#8208;band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8208;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Functional Groups Regulate Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Molecular Electrocatalyst for Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202407163</link>
      <description>Y. L. Chen, Cheng Zhang, Yubin Chen, Haijun Zhao, Yuda Wang, Zhouying Yue, Qiansen Wang, Jun Li, Meng Gu, Qingqing Cheng, Hui Yang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399582041

                Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) reactor represents a promising approach to industrial&#8208;level H2O2 production, while it is hampered by the lack of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts in acidic medium. Herein, we present a strategy for the specific oxygen functional group (OFG) regulation to promote the H2O2 selectivity up to 92% in acid on cobalt&#8208;porphyrin molecular assembled with reduced graphene oxide. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray adsorption spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy combined with theoretical calculation unravel that different OFGs exert distinctive regulation effects on the electronic structure of Co center through either remote (carboxyl and epoxy) or vicinal (hydroxyl) interaction manners, thus leading to the opposite influences on the promotion in 2e&#8208; ORR selectivity. As a consequence, the PEM electrolyzer integrated with the optimized catalyst can continuously and stably produce the high&#8208;concentration of ca. 7 wt% pure H2O2 aqueous solution at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 over 200 h with a cell voltage as low as ca. 2.1 V, suggesting the application potential in industrial&#8208;scale H2O2 electrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Amphiphilic Polymer Electrolyte Blocking Lattice Oxygen Evolution from High&#8208;Voltage Nickel&#8208;rich Cathodes for Ultra&#8208;Thermal Stabile Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202407024</link>
      <description>Jialiang Chen, Yan Lin, Bo Li, Hao Ren, Linchen Zhang, Yuanyuan Sun, Siyu Zhang, Xinchao Shang, Weidong Zhou, Mingbo Wu, Zhongtao Li, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399582079

                Ni&#8208;rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li&#8208;ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2&#8208; species in Ni&#8208;rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel&#8208;like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA&#8208;Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C&#8208;F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self&#8208;assemble on Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+&#8594;Co4+) at high volt (&gt;4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA&#8208;F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120&#8451; without short circuits or explosions.</description>

      <title>A Universal Coulombic Efficiency Compensation Strategy for Zinc&#8208;based Flow Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202406366</link>
      <description>Shiqiang Huang, Mengxiao Li, Yuxi Song, Shibo Xi, Chao Wu, Zhi Wei Javier Ang, Qing Wang, Advanced materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399601496

                Abstract Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are well suited for energy storage because of their good safety, high cell voltage, and low cost. However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, we report a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3&#8208;/4&#8722; &#8208;based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox&#8208;mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3&#8722; in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH) 4 ] 2&#8722; in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH &#8722; during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrated exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs but can also be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen&#8208;induced parasitic reactions.

                Herein, a self&#8208;supported, robust, and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free 3D hierarchical interface&#8208;rich Fe&#8208;doped Co&#8208;LDH@MoS2&#8208;Ni3S2/NF heterostructure electrocatalyst has been prepared through a controllable two&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The resultant electrode shows low overpotential of &#8275;95 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), &#8275;220 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the two&#8208;electrode system requires only a cell voltage of &#8275;1.54 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, respectively. Extensive ab initio calculations were carried out to find out the overpotential for HER, orbital interaction through the determination of electron density of states and quantification of charge transfer by Bader charge analysis. The computed overpotential matched closely with the experimental data. The superior HER performance of the tri&#8208;layer is enhanced due to the charge transfer (1.7444e) to Fe&#8208;doped Co&#8208;LDH from Ni3S2&#8208;MoS2 hybrid. This research strategy paves an effective pathway for affordable green H2 production and future efficient non&#8208;precious bifunctional electrocatalyst design for overall water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract The potential of electrochemical water splitting to tackle energy and environmental issues has garnered substantial interest. In the present work, an effective ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has been constructed by hydrothermal support on a stainless&#8208;steel strip and explored for oxygen evolution. The addition of ZnS modifies the band structure of In 2 Te 3 and enhances its specific conductivity and capacitance on an intrinsic level, making rapid ion transportation. The optimized ZnS/In 2 Te 3 displayed efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 228 mV and a Tafel slope of 111 mV dec &#8722;1 with cyclic activity up to 1000 cycles in 1 M KOH solution. ZnS/In 2 Te 3 has a large surface area (28 m 3 g &#8722;1 ) and a charge capacitance of (.037 mF), according to studies using Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller and double&#8208;layer capacitance. Combining several strategies improves overall electrochemical performance of ZnS/In 2 Te 3 , making it a promising option for use in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER.</description>

                A series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, with the same pillar and layer linkers 4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method within only 12 min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4:1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301 mV and Tafel slopes of 42 mV dec&#8722;1 on a glassy carbon electrode in 1 mol L&#8211;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was in situ grown in just 25 min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) where overpotentials of 313 and 328 mV at current densities of 50 and 300 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27 mV dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Rfar = 2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the discrepancy between the intrinsic structural instability and the apparent catalytic steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8208;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8208;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8208;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies during cycling in antiferroelectric HfxZr1&#8722;xO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0214584</link>
      <description>Haoji Qian, Ruijie Shen, Hongrui Zhang, Jiacheng Xu, Gufa Lin, Yu Ding, Jiani Gu, Xiao Yu, Yan Liu, Chengji Jin, Jiajia Chen, Genquan Han, Applied physics letters. 124(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399680029

                Antiferroelectric (AFE) ZrO2-based devices are anticipated to exhibit superior endurance properties in comparison to their ferroelectric (FE) counterparts. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of AFE devices remain elusive. In this study, guided by the dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies (Vo), we reveal three kinds of fatigue in AFE HfxZr1&#8722;xO2 (HZO) during uni-directional cycling. The first mechanism is related to the interfacial Vo charge trapping, which accelerates the switching from the P&#8595;&#8593; state to the P&#8595;&#8595; state, leading to extrinsic fatigue, and is demonstrated by electrical stress measurements. The other two mechanisms are Vo-related AFE to FE phase transition (PT) and Vo localization inside the HZO films, which are supported by the first-principles calculations. The highest polarization switching barrier occurs when Vo is localized at the tetra-coordinated oxygen sites inside HZO films. This means that tetra-coordinated Vo accumulation leads to less polarization switching, resulting in AFE to FE PT and Vo localization induced fatigue, i.e., intrinsic fatigue. This work reveals the dynamic evolution of Vo during cycling and its impact on AFE properties, paving the way for developing more durable AFE ZrO2-based devices and contributing to the emergence of diverse recovery methods in the future.</description>

                Although Ru&#8208;based materials are among the outstanding catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the instability issue still haunts them and impedes the widespread application. The instability of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts is generally ascribed to the formation of soluble species through the over&#8208;oxidation of Ru and structural decomposition caused by involvement of lattice oxygen. Herein, an effective strategy of selectively activating the lattice oxygen around Ru site is proposed to improve the OER activity and stability. Our synthesized spinel&#8208;type electrocatalyst of Ru and Zn co&#8208;doped Co3O4 showed an ultralow overpotential of 172 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and a long&#8208;term stability reaching to 100 hours at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for alkaline OER. The experimental results and theoretical simulations demonstrated that the lattice oxygen site jointly connected with the octahedral Ru and tetrahedral Zn atoms became more active than other oxygen sites near Ru atom, which further lowered the reaction energy barriers and avoided generating excessive oxygen vacancies to enhance the structural stability of Ru sites. The findings hope to provide a new perspective to improve the catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;incorporated OER catalysts and the stability of lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism.</description>

                Designing bifunctional catalysts to reduce the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) reaction barriers while accelerating the reaction kinetics is perceived to be a promising strategy to improve the performance of Zinc-air batteries. Unsymmetric configuration in single-atom catalysts has attracted attention due to its unique advantages in regulating electron orbitals. In this work, a seesaw effect in unsymmetric Fe-Co bimetallic monoatomic configurations is proposed, which can effectively improve the OER/ORR bifunctional activity of the catalyst. Compared with the symmetrical model of Fe-Co, a strong charge polarization between Co and Fe atoms in the unsymmetric model is detected, in whom the spin-down electrons around Co atoms are much higher than those spin-up electrons. The seesaw effect occurred between Co atoms and Fe atoms, resulting in a negative shift of the d-band center, which means that the adsorption of oxygen intermediates is weakened and more conducive to their dissociation. The optimized reaction kinetics of the catalyst leads to excellent performance in ZABs, with a peak power density of 215 mW cm</description>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolutionc reaction (OER) are important chemical reactions for a rechargeable lithium&#8211;oxygen battery (LOB). Recently, high-entropy alloys and oxides have attracted much attention because they showed good electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and/or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we aimed to synthesize and characterize CoSn(OH)6 and two types of high-entropy perovskite hydroxides, that is, (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Mg0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMMSOH) and (Co0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)Sn(OH)6 (CCFMNSOH). TEM observation and XRD measurements revealed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH had cubic crystals with sides of approximately 150&#8211;200 nm and crystal structures similar to those of perovskite-type CSOH. LSV measurement results showed that the high-entropy hydroxides CCFMMSOH and CCFMNSOH showed bifunctional catalytic functions for the ORR and OER. CCFMNSOH showed better catalytic performance than CCFMMSOH.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Metal Impurities on NiOOH Electrocatalytic Activity in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202400223</link>

                Abstract The energy transition and the implementation of new electrochemical technologies will result in an increased reliance on critical raw materials for electrodes. Their large&#8208;scale application will ultimately mean working with lower grade materials. Here we study the influence of metal impurities on nickel foam electrocatalysts. We do this by electrodepositing known amounts of first&#8208;row transition metals (Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) on nickel foam and studying their performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model reaction. The electrodes&#8217; performance is studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel analysis, stepwise chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Combining these results with microscopy analysis, we show that even small amounts of transition&#8208;metal impurities have profound effects on the catalytic performance of nickel electrodes. The changes affect the OER onset potential (the energy that the system requires to convert OH &#8211; to O 2 ) and the Tafel slope of each electrode (the electrode's initial activity in the OER onset region). Our results highlight the implications of such impurities on electrode design and future large&#8208;scale application.</description>

      <title>Effect of pH on the Selectivity of &#947;&#8208;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrocatalysts towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction in the Presence of Chloride Ions in Alkaline Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202400220</link>
      <description>Matthew D. Finn, B. J. Weathers, Bethany M. Hudak, Olga A. Baturina, ChemElectroChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399740275

                Abstract In this manuscript, we explore the effect of pH on the selectivity of a hydrothermally synthesized nanostructured &#947;&#8208;MnO 2 electrocatalyst in the alkaline environment. Selectivity of electrodeposited &#947;&#8208;MnO 2 toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.5 M NaCl at pH 12 has been demonstrated by Fujimura et al (Mat. Sci. Eng., A267 (1999) 254&#8211;259). Herein, we extend the pH region from pH 8.2 to pH 13 and demonstrate by thin&#8208;film rotating disk electrode (RDE) method that the catalyst is selective toward the OER at current densities up to ca 15 mA/cm 2 in the entire range of pH, if buffer is utilized to mitigate the effect of local pH. In synthetic seawater, at pH 8.2, the catalyst is not selective toward the OER. The analysis of the OER Tafel slopes at low current densities (&lt;3 mA/cm 2 ) shows that the slopes were not affected by pH in 0.5 M NaCl solutions, which suggests the same OER mechanism. At the same time, reaction rate decreased with decrease in pH. Nafion ionomer in the catalyst layer may adversely affect the catalyst's performance at pH &#8804;12 by limiting diffusion of OH &#8722; ions through the Nafion film. Catalyst layers need to be carefully designed to avoid negative effects of Nafion.</description>

      <title>Quantitative study of oxygen evolution reaction using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin-film electrodes</title>

                The development of water electrolysis catalysts that accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial challenge. Ni-based oxides are promising OER catalysts; however, quantitative studies of Ni-based oxides remain unexplored. In this study, we quantitatively evaluated the OER activity of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as a thin-film electrode catalyst. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin film fabricated using a sputtering method exhibited a current density of 6.6 and &#8764;2.6 mAcm&#8722;2 for geometric and estimated areas, respectively, at 1.78 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Ni3+ in the as-grown and post-OER LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 thin films. These results suggest that Ni3+ plays a key role in the OER of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4.</description>

                Abstract Alkali&#8208;metal doped perovskite oxides have emerged as promising materials due to their unique properties and broad applications in various fields, including photovoltaics and catalysis. Understanding the complex interplay between alkali metal doping, structural modifications, and their impact on performance remains a crucial challenge. In this study, this challenge is addressed by investigating the synthesis and properties of Rb&#8208;doped perovskite oxides. These results reveal that the doping of Rb into perovskite oxides function as a structural modifier in the as&#8208;synthesized samples and during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well. Electron microscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations confirm the enrichment of Rb on the surface of the as&#8208;synthesized sample. Further investigations into the electrocatalytic reaction revealed that the Rb&#8208;doped perovskite underwent drastic restructuring with Rb leaching and formation of strontium oxide.</description>

      <title>Phosphorous Vacancy and Built&#8208;In Electric Field Effect of Co&#8208;Doped MoP@MXene Heterostructures to Tune Catalytic Activity for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202400304</link>

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective, durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial but remains challenging due to slow hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) kinetics in water electrolysis. Herein, a combined engineering strategy of phosphorous vacancy (V p ) and spontaneous built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) is proposed to design novel highly&#8208;conductive Co&#8208;doped MoP@MXene heterostructures with phosphorous vacancy (V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene). Wherein, Co doping regulates the surface electronic structure and charge re&#8208;distribution of MoP, V p induces more defects and active sites, while BIEF accelerates the interfacial charge transfer rate between V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP and MXene. Therefore, the synergistic integration of V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP/MXene efficiently decreases activation energy and kinetic barrier, thus promoting its intrinsically catalytic activity and structural stability. Consequently, the V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene catalyst displays low overpotentials of 102.3/196.5 and 265.0/320.0 mV at 10/50 mA cm &#8722;2 for HER and OER, respectively. Notably, two&#8208;electrode electrolyzers with the V p &#8208;Co&#8208;MoP@MXene bifunctional catalysts to achieve 10/50 mA cm &#8722;2 , only need low&#8208;cell voltages of 1.57/1.64 V in alkaline media. Besides, experimental and theoretical results confirm that the hetero&#8208;structure effectively reduces hydrogen adsorption free energy and rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step energy barrier of OER intermediates, thereby greatly boosting its intrinsically catalytic activity. This work verifies an effective strategy to fabricate efficient non&#8208;precious bifunctional electro&#8208;catalysts for water splitting via combination engineering of phosphorous vacancy, cation doping, and BIEF.</description>

                The generation of clean, zero-carbon, and renewable energy is a challenge for the development of a sustainable and egalitarian society. Hydrogen gas can be produced by water electrolysis and has been claimed as the most promising option to replace fossil fuels. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most energetically demanding step of the water splitting and requires the use of electrocatalysts to overcome the kinetic barrier. Iron oxide nanomaterials have been emerging as a low-cost and Earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts. The synthesis of iron oxide assisted by plant extract is an eco-friendly approach to obtain nanomaterials with unique properties. Herein, we investigated iron oxide synthesized with the assistance of Camellia sinensis extract, under different experimental conditions towards oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis. Pure phases of iron oxide were obtained, ferrihydrite and maghemite showed overpotentials of 460 and 480 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 , respectively. After calcination, hematite was formed and the overpotential was raised to 610 and 810 mV, respectively. The lower overpotential of the amorphous materials could be related to the lower electron transfer resistance and faster reaction rate. On the other hand, the calcinated materials presented higher specific activity, stability and higher Faradaic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Data&#8208;Driven Descriptors for Establishing the Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Toward Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                The development of readily accessible and interpretable descriptors is pivotal yet challenging in the rational design of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts. This study presents a straightforward and physically interpretable activity descriptor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), derived from a dataset of bimetallic Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Through an artificial&#8208;intelligence (AI) data&#8208;mining subgroup discovery (SGD) approach, a combination of the d&#8208;band center and number of missing electrons in eg states of Ni, as well as the first ionization energy and number of electrons in eg states of the substituents, is revealed as a gene of a superior OER catalyst. The found descriptor, obtained from the AI analysis of a dataset of MOFs containing 3&#8208;5d transition metals and 13 organic linkers, has been demonstrated to facilitate in&#8208;depth understanding of structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. The descriptor is validated experimentally for 11 Ni&#8208;based MOFs. Combining SGD with physical insights and experimental verification, our work offers a highly efficient approach for screening MOF&#8208;based OER catalysts, simultaneously providing comprehensive understanding of the catalytic mechanism.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the discrepancy between the intrinsic structural instability and the apparent catalytic steadiness of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202409079</link>

                Despite the widespread investigations on the M&#8208;N&#8208;C type single atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an internal conflict between its intrinsic thermodynamically structural instability and apparent catalytic steadiness has long been ignored. Clearly unfolding this contradiction is necessary and meaningful for understanding the real structure&#8208;property relation of SACs. Herein, by using the well&#8208;designed pH&#8208;dependent metal leaching experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, an unconventional structure reconstruction of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst during OER process was observed. Combining with density functional theory calculations, the initial Ni&#8208;N coordination is easily broken in the presence of adsorbed OH*, leading to favorable formation of Ni&#8208;O coordination. The formed Ni&#8208;O works stably as the real active center for OER catalysis in alkaline media but unstably in acid, which clearly explains the existing conflict. Unveiling the internal contradiction between structural instability and catalytic steadiness provides valuable insights for rational design of single atom OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Amphiphilic Polymer Electrolyte Blocking Lattice Oxygen Evolution from High&#8208;Voltage Nickel&#8208;rich Cathodes for Ultra&#8208;Thermal Stabile Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407024</link>
      <description>Jialiang Chen, Yan Lin, Qiang Li, Hao Ren, Linchen Zhang, Yi Sun, Siyu Zhang, Xinchao Shang, Weidong Zhou, Mingbo Wu, Zhongtao Li, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399581620

                Ni&#8208;rich cathodes have been intensively adopted in Li&#8208;ion batteries to pursuit high energy density, which still suffering irreversible degradation at high voltage. Some unstable lattice O2&#8208; species in Ni&#8208;rich cathodes would be oxidized to singlet oxygen 1O2 and released at high volt, which lead to irreversible phase transfer from the layered rhombohedral (R) phase to a spinel&#8208;like (S) phase. To overcome the issue, the amphiphilic copolymers (UMA&#8208;Fx) electrolyte were prepared by linking hydrophobic C&#8208;F side chains with hydrophilic subunits, which could self&#8208;assemble on Ni&#8208;rich cathode surface and convert to stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer. Thereafter, the oxygen releasing of polymer coated cathode was obviously depressed and substituted by the Co oxidation (Co3+&#8594;Co4+) at high volt (&gt;4.2V), which could suppressed irreversible phase transfer and improve cycling stability. Moreover, the amphiphilic polymer electrolyte was also stable with Li anode and had high ion conductivity. Therefore, the NCM811//UMA&#8208;F6//Li pouch cell exhibited outstanding energy density (362.97 Wh/kg) and durability (cycled 200 times at 4.7V), which could be stalely cycled even at 120&#8451; without short circuits or explosions.</description>

                Given their intriguing properties, porous carbons have surfaced as promising electrocatalysts for various energy conversion reactions. This study presents a unique approach where iron-cobalt (FeCo) is confined in a boron, nitrogen-doped chitosan-derived porous carbon aerogel (BNPC-FeCo) to serve as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The BNPC-FeCo-900 electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent catalyst activity, with very low overpotentials of 186 and 320 mV at 10 mA cm</description>

                Synthesis of high-entropy oxide (HEO) nanocrystals has focused on increasing the temperature in the entropy term (T(&#916;S)) to overcome the enthalpy term. However, these high temperatures lead to large, polydisperse nanocrystals. In this work, we leverage the low solubility product (Ksp) of metal oxides and optimize the Lewis-acid-catalyzed esterification reaction for equal rate production of the cation monomers to synthesize HEO nanocrystals at low temperatures, producing the smallest (&lt;4 nm) and most monodisperse (&lt;15% size dispersity) HEOs to date. We apply these HEO nanocrystals as electrocatalysts, exhibiting promising activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media, with an overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA/cm2.</description>

                The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro&#8208;electrochemical X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell&#8217;s performance. The first two reactions; an in&#8208;situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in&#8208;situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.</description>

                N-regulated three-dimensional (3D) turf-like carbon material loaded with FeCoNi nanoalloys (F-CNS-CNT), composed of carbon nanotubes (CNT) grown in situ on carbon nanosheets(CNS), was synthesized using a low-temperature solution combustion method and organic compounds rich in pyridinic-N. This distinct structure significantly expands the effective electrochemical surface area, revealing an abundance of active sites and enhancing the mass transfer capability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations corroborate that the synergy between the FeCoNi nanoalloy and the highly pyridinic N-doped carbon substrate optimizes the adsorption and desorption-free energy of oxygen intermediates, resulting in a remarkable improvement of intrinsic ORR/OER activity. Therefore, the derived F-CNS-CNT electrocatalyst can present a favorable half-wave potential of 0.85 V (ORR) and a lower overpotential of 260 mV (corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Leaching of Ni Dopants in IrRu Alloy Electrocatalyst Boosts Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract The commercialization of water&#8208;splitting technology strongly relies on the stable and high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER&#8208;OER). In this work, the nickel dopants in IrRu alloyed electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting activity are investigated. The incorporation of nickel dopants induces more oxygen atoms coordinating with Ir/Ru facilitating the formation of *OOH species via nucleophilic attack by H 2 O. Additionally, a fast surface reconstruction is achieved due to the electrochemical dissolution of Ni dopants; as a result, more oxygen species are incorporated, evidenced by in situ Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Therefore, the mass activity for Ni@IrRu is enhanced by threefold than commercial IrO 2 in acidic OER catalysis. Moreover, the nickel dopants balance the hydrogen binding strength; as a result, only 609 mV overpotential is demanded to reach 1 A cm &#8722;2 in acidic HER catalysis. The polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) test indicates only 1.87 V is required to attain 2 A cm &#8722;2 , 160 mV lower than Pt/C&#8208;IrO 2 revealing its potential application in PEMWE.</description>

                Abstract Homogeneous microstructure in lead alloy matrix plays an important role in improving its mechanical and electrochemical properties. In this work, different stirring speed provided during the melt casting of the alloy are tended to obtain lead alloys with different microstructure. The results show that proper stirring speed is beneficial for improving the overall homogeneity of the alloy, however, as the stirring speed is too high, plenty of second phase impurities and defects produced in the lead matrix, which possesses negative effect on the mechanical and electrochemical properties. The most uniform composition and homogeneous microstructure was obtained when the stirring speed is 100 r/min, which is conducive to the decrease of oxygen evolution potential of 30 mV and charge transfer resistance of 22.77%, and the increase of the corrosion resistance of 1.49%, and promote the generation of the uniform and dense PbO2 protective layer.</description>

                Abstract To address the rising demand for H_{2} for fuel cells, hydrogen is produced through water splitting (electrochemically/photoelectrochemically).Although perovskite-structured materials show promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their effectiveness in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a challenge. Consequently, there's a growing demand for bifunctional catalysts exhibiting high electroactivity across a broad pH range. One potential candidate for exploration as a negative electrode in batteries and fuel cells is LaFeO_{3}. With co-substitution of Sr and Ti, La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}Fe_{0.5}Ti_{0.5}O_{3} (LSFT) is formed and explored as an air electrode. In this study, we systematically assess LSFT as a bifunctional catalyst across a broad pH spectrum of electrolytic solutions. LSFT displays increased current densities in both the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) domains, alongside improved stability, notably in neutral conditions. Our investigation incorporates Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to determine surface binding energies and construct a Pourbaix diagram. The results underscore the robustness of LSFT as a perovskite-based bifunctional catalyst, achieving a cycle stability exceeding 600 cycles and a chronopotentiometric stability of 1500 hours with a stable potential of \sim2 V at the current density of 150 mA/cm&#178; in the neutral environment.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical water splitting offers an advancing approach to producing highly pure hydrogen and oxygen, motivated by the prevalence of a low&#8208;carbon economy and the goal of a sustainable future. The customized modulation of electronic structures enables the electrocatalyst to directionally promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a promising shortcut to overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, 3D homologous WSeS/CoSeS heterojunction nanoarrays (WSeS/CoSeS NAs) and W&#8208;doped CoSeS nanoarrays (W&#8208;CoSeS NAs) are investigated. Abundant heterointerfaces within WSeS/CoSeS NAs facilitate HER kinetics, boosting mass diffusivity, and increasing carrier separation and transfer process. High&#8208;valence W 6+ doping into CoSeS prevents phase separation and stabilizes Co sites by charge offset effect, leading to enhanced OER. Consequently, the WSeS/CoSeS NAs and W&#8208;CoSeS NAs reach 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at an overpotential of 43.8 and 233.3 mV in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, when asymmetrically engaged as an electrolyzer, this configuration exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performances (cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with satisfying stability and mechanical robustness (over 1000 h at 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The modulation and manufacture of reaction&#8208;property&#8208;oriented materials are experimentally and theoretically validated potential, illuminating the light of inspiration for multiple applications.</description>

                Metal atom catalysts have been among the most important research objects due to their specific physical and chemical properties. However, precise control of the anchoring of metal atoms is still challenging to achieve. Cobalt and iridium atomic arrays formed sequentially ordered stable arrays in graphdiyne (GDY) triangular cavities depending on their intrinsic chemical properties and interactions. The success of this method was attributed to multifunctional integration of GDY, enabling selective growth from one to several atoms and various atomic densities. The bimetallic atom arrays show several advantages resulting from reducibility of acetylene bonds, space limiting effect, incomplete charge transfer between GDY and metal atoms, and sp&#8208;C hybridized triple bond skeleton. This well&#8208;designed system exhibits unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a mass activity of 2.6 A mgcat.&#8211;1 at a low overpotential of 300 mV, which is 216.6 times higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art IrO2 catalyst, and long&#8208;term stability.</description>

                Abstract Owing to great energy density, eco-friendliness, safety and security, and cost-effectiveness, rechargeable metal-air batteries (MABs) have engrossed substantial devotion. The MABs signify one of the most feasible forthcoming alternatives to powering electric vehicles (EVs) and smart-grid energy storage. The progress of MABs has offered a solution benefitting from its much higher theoretical energy density than that of lithium-ion batteries (LIB). However, certain technical difficulties allied with metal-air batteries include sluggish electrochemical oxygen reaction kinetics that has yet to be fixed. The transition single metal and mixed metals sulfides (TMS) nanostructures have validated an advanced electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, due to their higher electronic conductivity and fast-charge transfer kinetics. The bifunctional electrocatalytic act of the TMSs can be enhanced by altering the electronic configuration, double layer structure and interface, valence state, and vacancies. In this minireview, the preparation, properties, and testing of electrode components of transition metal sulfides (TMS) nanomaterials towards different types of metal-air batteries (aqueous and non-aqueous), the fundamentals, configuration of battery, choice of electrode materials, electrolyte, and separator, current challenges as well as perspectives of the design of high-performance MABs are also discussed based on the existing execution.</description>

                Robust engineering of two-dimensional (2D) materials via covalent grafting of organic molecules has been a great strategy for permanently tuningtheir physicochemical behaviors toward electrochemical energy applications. Herein, we demonstrated that a covalent functionalization approach of graphitic surfaces including graphene by a graftable porphyrin (g-Por) derivative, abbreviated as g-Por/HOPG or g-Por/G, is realizable. The efficiency of this approach is determined at both the molecular and global scales by using a state-of-the-art toolbox including cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Consequently, g-Por molecules were proven to covalently graft on graphitic surfaces via C-C bonds, resulting in the formation of a robust novel hybrid 2D material visualized by AFM and STM imaging. Interestingly, the resulting robust molecular material was elucidated as a novel bifunctional catalyst for both the oxygen evolution (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in acidic medium with highly catalytic stability and examined at the molecular level. These findings contribute to an in-depth understanding at the molecular level ofthe contribution of the synergetic effects of molecular structures toward the water-splitting process.</description>

                Abstract Coordination complexes are promising candidates for powerful electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but challenges remain in favoring the kinetics behaviors through local coordination regulation. Herein, by refining the synergy of carboxylate anions and multiconjugated tripodal benzimidazole ligands, we tailor a series of well-defined and stable coordination complexes (CCs), Ni-tPBA0~3, with three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular/coordinated structures. The coordinated water as potential open coordination sites (OCSs) can directly become intermediates, while the metal center easily achieves re-coordination with water molecules in the pores to resist lattice oxygen dissolution. Specifically, nickel centers with mono-coordinated water undergo the intermolecular oxygen coupling while those with neighboring coordinated water molecules follow an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism (IOM) with a low thermodynamic energy barrier. With more coordinated water introduced, an optimized IOM process appears with the synergy of potential OCSs, enabling fast generation of &#8211;Ni&#8211;(OH)x intermediate and synchronizing the re-coordination of water molecules with the deprotonation of active &#8211;OH for enhanced kinetics. As such, a low overpotential of 265 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and long-term stability of 150 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 was achieved, superior to most single transition metal-based molecular electrocatalysts. This study underscores the potential of crafting the coordinated water molecules for efficient electrocatalysis applications.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting through the electrolyzer is the most promising strategy for hydrogen production. Recently, water electrolysis is mainly based on high&#8208;purity freshwater, which not only consumes a large number of freshwater resources but also improves the overall cost due to the extra water purification system. Hence, direct electrolysis of seawater is more desirable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. As is known, the dominant rate&#8208;determining step of overall water splitting is the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves four&#8208;electron transfer and owns a much larger overpotential than cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction. The large challenge for the design of OER catalysts in the seawater media is the competition reaction between OER and chloride oxidation reaction, which greatly influences energy efficiency. Hence, except for the activity and stability, selectivity is another key point for seawater splitting. Herein, after a brief introduction of two half reactions for water splitting, the latest metal hydr(oxide) electrocatalysts with different crystalline structures are summarized according to the previous reports. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of three common water electrolyzers are compared. Finally, the perspectives of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production are outlined for practical applications.</description>

                Abstract Although lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) hold great promise as future energy storage systems, they are impeded by insulated discharge product Li 2 O 2 and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution revolution (ORR/OER) kinetics. The application of a highly efficient cathode catalyst determines the LOBs performance. The d&#8208;band modulation and catalytic kinetics promotion are important concept guidelines for the performance enhancement of cathode catalysts. In this work, the homogeneous in&#8208;plane distortion&#8208;derived synergistic catalytic capability of an Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 catalyst with modulated d&#8208;band centers and promoted ORR/OER kinetics is demontrated. The uniform elongation of Ag&#9472;O bonds and compression of Mo&#9472;O bonds in (020) plane leads to d&#8208;band splitting and d&#8208;band center optimization and delivers improved adsorption behavior for high ORR/OER capability. Furthermore, the spatial and energy overlap of Ag d xz and O 2 anti&#8208;bonding &#960; * orbitals facilitate electron injection during ORR process and reduce the energy barrier for charge transfer and O 2 desorption during OER process, accelerating the ORR/OER kinetics. As a result, the (020) plane&#8208;exposed Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 cathode exhibits ultralong cycle stability of 817 cycles at 500 mA g &#8722;1 and large specific discharge/charge capacities of 15898/15180 mAh g &#8722;1 . This work provides facile concept guidance for optimizing catalytic capability through controlled lattice distortion in cathode catalysts for LOBs.</description>

                IrO2 is the benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, the high cost and low earth abundance hinder its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, surface&#8208;segregated IrCo nanoparticles on CoO nanosheets with a strong electronic interaction are synthesized through the ion exchange&#8208;pyrolysis method. The resulting IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures, containing an ultra&#8208;low Ir content of 4.73 wt %, demonstrate exceptional performance in the acidic OER. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and remarkable stability, with noticeable activity decay observed only after 140 hours of continuous operation. These results surpass most reported Ir&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Specifically, the mass activity at the overpotential of 300 mV for the IrCo&#8208;CoO catalyst reaches 124.52 mA mgIr&#8208;1, which is 20 times higher than that of commercial IrO2. Furthermore, we constructed a home&#8208;made overall water splitting cell utilizing IrCo&#8208;CoO heterostructures as both anode and cathode electrodes, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a voltage of 1.51 V. Our findings present a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;efficient catalysts with significantly reduced noble metals loading.</description>

      <title>Sulfidation of Iron - Based Nanomaterial as Catalyst for Water Splitting Using Hydrothermal</title>

                Consumption of fossil fuels causes greenhouse effect and global warming, hence the need for renewable energy sources that are environmentally friendly. Hydrogen is one of the abundant elements on earth. Hydrogen refers to a clean and renewable energy source, hydrogen can be a good choice to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One way to produce hydrogen is by electrochemical water splitting. This study aims to determine the characterization of iron-based nanomaterials (iron sulfide - iron hydroxide) as a water splitting catalyst in general. Iron sulfide synthesis was carried out using hydrothermal sulfidation method for 6 hours at 80 oC with nickel foam as substrate. Synthesis of iron sulfide varying the concentration of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (0.0125 M, 0.025 M, 0.05 M and 0.1 M) produced brownish yellow to blackish grey colored samples. Characterization results using XRD showed that iron sulfide peaks were detected at higher concentrations of sodium sulfide nonahydrate. Based on the results of analyzing iron hydroxide using SEM, it is known that the sample is in the form of nano walls and on iron sulfide, it is known that the sample is in the form of nanoscale particles. Based on electrochemical measurement results, iron hydroxide can be a good catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with commercial Pt/C. The overpotential of iron hydroxide is smaller than Pt/C, which is only 15 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm2 and iron sulfide can be a good catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with electrocatalytic measurement results close to commercial RuO2. This is indicated by the small overpotential (260 mV at current densisty 10 mA/cm2 and small tafel slope (51 mV/dec).</description>

                We have demonstrated a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from a two&#8208;dimensional noninterpenetrated layer to a microporous three&#8208;dimensional fourfold interpenetrated MOF. The centrosymmetric [Co 2 (&#956; 2 &#8208;OH)(EIBA) 3 ] n ( SNUT&#8208;25 ) transforms into a microporous [Co(EIBA) 2 ] n ( SNUT&#8208;26 ), which is triggered by the reaction time with DMF that acts as a structure&#8208;directing agent (HEIBA = 4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzoic acid; DMF = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethylformamide). Despite the distinct structure and coordination arrangements of SNUT&#8208;25 in contrast to SNUT&#8208;26 , both Co&#8208;MOFs were synthesized using the same ligand. Fascinatingly, upon introducing a specific quantity of DMF combined with a negligible proportion of nitric acid, SNUT&#8208;25 will progressively and completely transform into SNUT&#8208;26 . Under the synergistic induction of solvent molecules and temperature, SNUT&#8208;25 changed from the original two&#8208;dimensional layered structure to the three&#8208;dimensional pore structure of SNUT&#8208;26 . In addition, SNUT&#8208;25 and SNUT&#8208;26 are efficient photocatalysts for the degradation of organic dye methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. Surprisingly, the degradation rates of both SNUT&#8208;25 and SNUT&#8208;26 can reach over 96%. In addition, SNUT&#8208;25 and SNUT&#8208;26 also exhibited high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.</description>

      <title>Study of the Suitability of Corncob Biochar as Electrocatalyst for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/batteries10060209</link>

                There has been a recent increasing interest in Zn&#8211;air batteries as an alternative to Li-ion batteries. Zn&#8211;air batteries possess some significant advantages; however, there are still problems to solve, especially related to the tuning of the properties of the air&#8211;cathode which should carry an inexpensive but efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reaction electrocatalyst. Biochar can be an alternative, since it is a material of low cost, it exhibits electric conductivity, and it can be used as support for transition metal ions. Although there is a significant number of publications on biochars, there is a lack of data about biochar from raw biomass rich in hemicellulose, and biochar with a small number of heteroatoms, in order to report the pristine activity of the carbon phase. In this work, activated biochar has been made by using corncobs. The biomass was first dried and minced into small pieces and pyrolyzed. Then, it was mixed with KOH and pyrolyzed for a second time. The final product was characterized by various techniques and its electroactivity as a cathode was determined. Physicochemical characterization revealed that the biochar had a hierarchical pore structure, moderate surface area of 92 m2 g&#8722;1, carbon phase with a relatively low sp2/sp3 ratio close to one, and a limited amount of N and S, but a high number of oxygen groups. The graphitization was not complete while the biochar had an ordered structure and contained significant O species. This biochar was used as an electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in Zn&#8211;air batteries where it demonstrated a satisfactory performance. More specifically, it reached an open-circuit voltage of about 1.4 V, which was stable over a period of several hours, with a short-circuit current density of 142 mA cm&#8722;2 and a maximum power density of 55 mW cm&#8722;2. Charge&#8211;discharge cycling of the battery was achieved between 1.2 and 2.1 V for a constant current of 10 mA. These data show that corncob biochar demonstrated good performance as an electrocatalyst in Zn&#8211;air batteries, despite its low specific surface and low sp2/sp3 ratio, owing to its rich oxygen sites, thus showing that electrocatalysis is a complex phenomenon and can be served by biochars of various origins.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Ions Synergistic Bilayer H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Pillared MXene Directing In Situ Ordered Embedding Growth of Highly Efficient NiFe Alloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202408303</link>
      <description>Zhongjie Qiu, Jiayan Wu, Baolin Zhang, Hui&#8208;Hua Song, Zhiming Cui, Zhenxing Liang, Li Du, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399764220

                Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi&#8208;directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano&#8208;hybrid material (NiFe/MX&#8208;HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX&#8208;HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene&#8208;based heterogeneous materials.</description>

                Abstract Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses M &#8819; 1.1 M&#8857; probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon&#8211;oxygen (CO) versus oxygen&#8211;neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields &#8211; single stellar evolution or a stellar merger &#8211; is another open question. The steep mass&#8211;radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time tcryst, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf&#8217;s surface delays the magnetic field&#8217;s breakout time tbreak &amp;gt; tcryst. We compute tbreak(M) for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that tbreak is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.</description>

                Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses $M\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) versus oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields - single stellar evolution or a stellar merger - is another open question. The steep mass-radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time $t_{\rm cryst}$, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf's surface delays the magnetic field's breakout time $t_{\rm break}&gt;t_{\rm cryst}$. We compute $t_{\rm break}(M)$ for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that $t_{\rm break}$ is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.</description>

                Manganese, a 3d transition metal, with variable oxidation states(-3 to +7) is ubiquitous in earth&#8217;s crust, has low toxicity, and as a catalyst in cyanobacterial photosynthesis accumulated oxygen in the ocean which gradually escaped into the atmosphere displacing methane sometime between 2.4 &#8211; 2.1 billion years ago1. Cyanobacteria evolved from an anaerobic environment to produce oxygen which wiped out much of anaerobic life and gave rise to aerobic metabolism. Manganese thus plays a central role in evolution. Biophysical and biochemical studies of manganese as biocatalysts is described from a chemical and biological perspective in this chapter. The dissertation work done by the author dictates the choices in this chapter that are thus more like vignettes considering the vast amount of ongoing work in the area of Manganese bio catalysis. Manganese as a catalyst that produces hydrogen from water might turn out to be the key to a carbon neutral green economy of the future.</description>

                Abstract An interplay between Pd and PdO and their spatial distribution inside the particles are relevant for numerous catalytic reactions. Using in situ time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) supported by theoretical simulations, a mechanistic picture of the structural evolution of 2.3 nm palladium nanoparticles upon their exposure to molecular oxygen is provided. XAS analysis revealed the restructuring of the fcc &#8208;like palladium surface into the 4&#8208;coordinated structure of palladium oxide upon absorption of oxygen from the gas phase and formation of core@shell Pd@PdO structures. The reconstruction starts from the low&#8208;coordinated sites at the edges of palladium nanoparticles. Formation of the PdO shell does not affect the average Pd&#8210;Pd coordination numbers, since the decrease of the size of the metallic core is compensated by a more spherical shape of the oxidized nanoparticles due to a weaker interaction with the support. The metallic core is preserved below 200 &#176;C even after continuous exposure to oxygen, with its size decreasing insignificantly upon increasing the temperature, while above 200 &#176;C, bulk oxidation proceeds. The Pd&#8210;Pd distances in the metallic phase progressively decrease upon increasing the fraction of the Pd oxide due to the alignment of the cell parameters of the two phases.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Plasma Oxidation of Ag Nanofilms: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>

                Plasma oxidation of metals has been studied extensively to fabricate nanoporous oxides with the merits of room temperature treatment and facile control of the oxidation rate. Plasma oxidation of Ag, motivated by studies on atomic oxygen corrosion of Ag, is one of the most studied systems. However, several important questions remain unaddressed and even overlooked traditionally: the critical role played by atomic O in promoting oxidation, evolution of microstructures during plasma exposure, and a sound framework for quantitative oxidation kinetic analyses. In this paper, the O2 plasma oxidation behavior of Ag films deposited on Si substrates was systematically studied both experimentally and theoretically. The effects of plasma pressure and power on the microstructural evolution and oxidation kinetics of Ag films of various thicknesses were investigated using comprehensive characterization, as well as numerical analysis of plasma chemistry for deriving atomic O concentration. The findings here provide a full picture and deep mechanistic insights into the morphology and microstructure evolution of Ag films and the growth of dense or porous Ag2O and AgO oxide layers by plasma oxidation, revealing the intricate interplay between atomic O, vacancy creation, Ag ion diffusion, Kirkendall effect, formation of pores, and interfacial void coalescence.

      <title>Evolution of the Surface Wettability of Vertically Oriented Multilayer Graphene Sheets Deposited by Plasma Technology</title>

                Carbon deposits consisting of vertically oriented multilayer graphene sheets on metallic foils represent an interesting alternative to activated carbon in electrical and electrochemical devices such as super-capacitors because of the superior electrical conductivity of graphene and huge surface&#8211;mass ratio. The graphene sheets were deposited on cobalt foils by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition using propane as the carbon precursor. Plasma was sustained by an inductively coupled radiofrequency discharge in the H mode at a power of 500 W and a propane pressure of 17 Pa. The precursor effectively dissociated in plasma conditions and enabled the growth of porous films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets. The deposition rate varied with time and peaked at 100 nm/s. The evolution of surface wettability was determined by the sessile drop method. The untreated substrates were moderately hydrophobic at a water contact angle of about 110&#176;. The contact angle dropped to about 50&#176; after plasma treatment for less than a second and increased monotonously thereafter. The maximal contact angle of 130&#176; appeared at a treatment time of about 30 s. Thereafter, it slowly decreased, with a prolonged deposition time. The evolution of the wettability was explained by surface composition and morphology. A brief treatment with oxygen plasma enabled a super-hydrophilic surface finish of the films consisting of multilayer graphene sheets.</description>

      <title>Oxygen and sulfur stable isotope ratios of Late Devonian vertebrates trace the relative salinity of their aquatic environments</title>

                Late Devonian aquatic environments hosted the fin-to-limb transition in vertebrates. Upper Devonian (ca. 365&#8722;360 Ma) strata in Pennsylvania, USA, preserve a diversity of fishes and tetrapods in coastal marine to fluvial depositional environments, making this region ideal for investigating the ecology and evolution of Late Devonian vertebrates. A key unresolved issue has been reconstructing the specific aquatic habitats that hosted various vertebrates during this period. Specifically, the salinity of environments spanning fresh to shallow marine water is difficult to discern from sedimentological and paleontological analyses alone. Here, we analyze rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) as well as stable oxygen and sulfur isotope compositions (&#948;18O, &#948;34S) in fossil vertebrate bioapatite from late Famennian (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma) strata of the Catskill and Lock Haven formations in the Appalachian Basin, USA, to determine the relative salinity of their aquatic environments. These results confirm the ecological euryhalinity of several taxa (Bothriolepis sp., tristichopterids, and Holoptychius sp.). Our results are the first demonstrating that some early tetrapod species occupied unequivocally freshwater habitats by late Famennian time (ca. 362&#8722;360 Ma). Our study shows that integrating sedimentological and paleontological data with combined oxygen and sulfur isotope analysis allows precise tracing of the relative salinity of vertebrate habitats deep in the past.</description>

                EPAS1HIF2a is the primary gene implicated in systemic hypoxia adaptation. Conversely, aberrantly activated EPAS1HIF2a acts as a tumor driver against which anti-tumor therapeutics are proven effective. We elucidated connections between adaptation to systemic hypoxia in high-altitude populations, such as Tibetans and Sherpas, and human tumors. Similar to the accelerated adaptability observed in high-altitude populations via genetic introgression, tumors from patients with hypoxia since birth exhibited impaired DNA repair and increased mutation burden. As in high-altitude dwellers, EPAS1HIF2a genetic variants were positively selected within sympathetic tumors developed under hypoxia, with a consistently high frequency of 90%. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing followed by in vitro studies have shown that hypoxia and EPAS1HIF2a gain-of-function tumor mutations induce COX4i2 expression and impair mitochondrial respiration, indicating that decreased cellular oxygen consumption may confer a proliferative advantage in hypoxia. Analyzing medical data from a patient cohort with hypoxia since birth who developed/did not develop tumors revealed tissue-specific and time-dependent tumorigenic effects of systemic hypoxia, which is limited to oxygen-sensitive and responsive cells, particularly during the postnatal period. This study supports connections between the EPAS1HIF2a genetic adaptation in human tumors developed under systemic hypoxia to populations living in high altitudes. The genetic adaptations in populations to different stressors can be explored further to understand tumorigenesis and tumor evolution.</description>

                Abstract. The study of isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen in fossilized air trapped in ice core bubbles provides information on variations in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes and productivity in the past. However, to refine these interpretations, it is necessary to better quantify fractionation of oxygen in the biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. We set up a system of closed biological chambers in which we studied the evolution of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 due to biological processes. To easily replicate experiments, we developed a multiplexing system which we describe here. We compared measurements of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 using two different measurement techniques: optical spectrometry (Optical-Feedback Cavity- Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy, i.e. OF-CEAS technique), which enables higher temporal resolution and continuous data collection and isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with a flanged air recovery system, thus validating the data analysis conducted through the OF-CEAS technique. As a first application, we investigated isotopic discrimination during respiration and photosynthesis. We conducted a 5-day experiment using maize (Zea mays L.) as model species. The 18O discrimination value for maize during dark plant respiration was determined as - 17.8 &#177; 0.9 &#8240; by IRMS and - 16.1 &#177; 1.1 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. We also found a value attributed to the isotopic discrimination of terrestrial photosynthesis equal to + 3.2 &#177; 2.6 &#8240; by IRMS and + 6.7 &#177; 3.8 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. These findings were consistent with a previous study by Paul et al. (2023).</description>

                Abstract Complex multi-element alloys are gaining prominence for structural applications, supplementing steels, and superalloys. Understanding the impact of each element on alloy surfaces due to oxidation is vital in maintaining material integrity. This study investigates oxidation mechanisms in these alloys using a model five-element equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy, in a controlled oxygen environment. The oxidation-induced surface changes correlate with each element&#8217;s interactive tendencies with the environment, guided by thermodynamics. Initial oxidation stages follow atomic size and redox potential, with the latter becoming dominant over time, causing composition inversion. The study employs in-situ atom probe tomography, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure techniques to elucidate the oxidation process and surface oxide structure evolution. Our findings deconvolute the mechanism for compositional and structural changes in the oxide film and will pave the way for a predictive design of complex alloys with improved resistance to oxidation under extreme conditions.</description>

                We present here initial results of our spectro-photometric monitoring of XZ Tau. During our monitoring period, XZ Tau exhibited several episodes of brightness variations in timescales of months at optical wavelengths in contrast to the mid-infrared wavelengths. The color evolution of XZ Tau during this period suggests that the brightness variations are driven by changes in accretion from the disc. The mid-infrared light curve shows an overall decline in brightness by &#8764; 0.5 and 0.7 magnitude respectively in WISE W1 (3.4 &#956;m) and W2 (4.6 &#956;m) bands. The emission profile of the hydrogen recombination lines along with that of Ca II IRT lines points towards magnetospheric accretion of XZ Tau. We have detected P Cygni profile in H&#946; indicating of out-flowing winds from regions close to accretion. Forbidden transitions of oxygen are also detected, likely indicating jets originating around the central pre-main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations with a new local chiral N3LO nucleon-nucleon
  force</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.07956</link>
      <description>P. Y. Wang, J. G. Li, Shuai Zhang, Qiong Yuan, M. R. Xie, W. Zuo, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399657380

                Ab initio calculations have achieved remarkable success in nuclear structure studies. Numerous works highlight the pivotal role of three-body forces in nuclear ab initio calculations. Concurrently, efforts have been made to replicate these calculations using only realistic nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions. A novel local chiral next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) NN interaction, distinct due to its weaker tensor force, has recently been established. This paper applies this local NN interaction in ab initio frameworks to calculate the low-lying spectra of p-shell light nuclei, particularly 10B, ground-state energies and shell evolution in oxygen isotopes. Results are compared with calculations utilizing nonlocal chiral N3LO NN and chiral NN +3N interactions. The ab initio calculations with the local N N potential accurately describe the spectra of p-shell nuclei, notably the 10B. Additionally, the neutron drip line for oxygen isotopes, with 24O as the drip line nucleus, is accurately reproduced in ab initio calculations with the local NN interaction. Calculations with the local NN interaction also reproduce the subshell closure at N = 14 and 16, albeit with a stronger shell gap compared to experimental data. However, the calculated charge radii based on the local NN interaction are underestimated compared with experimental data, which is similar to results from the nonlocal NN interaction. Consequently, the present ab initio calculations further indicate significant spin-orbit splitting effects with the new local NN potential, suggesting that 3N forces remain an important consideration.</description>

      <title>Population-specific responses to pollution exposure suggest local adaptation of invasive red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii along the Mediterranean French coastline</title>

                Abstract Anthropogenic stressors can have an impact in a broad range of physiological processes and can be a major selective force leading to rapid evolution and local population adaptation. In this study, three populations of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii were investigated. They are geographically separated for at least 20 years, and live in different abiotic environments: a freshwater inland lake (Salagou lake) with no major anthropogenic influence and two other coastal wetlands regularly polluted by pesticides along the Mediterranean coast (Camargue region and Bages-Sigean lagoon). Collected adults were genetically characterized using the mitochondrial COI gene and haplotype frequencies were analyzed for genetic variability within and between populations. Results revealed a higher genetic diversity for these invasive populations than any previous report in France, with more than seven different haplotypes in a single population. The contrasting genetic diversity between the Camargue and the other two populations suggest different times and sources of introduction. To identify differences in key physiological responses between these populations, individuals from each population were maintained in controlled conditions. Data on oxygen consumption rates indicate that the Salagou and Bages-Sigean populations possess a high inter-individual variability compared to the Camargue population. The low individual variability of oxygen consumption and low genetic diversity suggest a specific local adaptation for the Camargue population. Population-specific responses were identified when individuals were exposed to a pesticide cocktail containing azoxystrobin and oxadiazon at sublethal concentrations. The Salagou population was the only one with altered hydro-osmotic balance due to pollutant exposure and a change in protease activity in the hepatopancreas. These results revealed different phenotypic responses suggesting local adaptations at the population level.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the coevolution of photosynthesis and Bacteria</title>

                Life harnessing light energy transformed the relationship between biology and Earth-bringing a massive flux of organic carbon and oxidants to Earth's surface that gave way to today's organotrophy- and respiration-dominated biosphere. However, our understanding of how life drove this transition has largely relied on the geological record; much remains unresolved due to the complexity and paucity of the genetic record tied to photosynthesis. Here, through holistic phylogenetic comparison of the bacterial domain and all photosynthetic machinery (totally spanning &gt;10,000 genomes), we identify evolutionary congruence between three independent biological systems-bacteria, (bacterio)chlorophyll-mediated light metabolism (chlorophototrophy), and carbon fixation-and uncover their intertwined history. Our analyses uniformly mapped progenitors of extant light-metabolizing machinery (reaction centers, [bacterio]chlorophyll synthases, and magnesium-chelatases) and enzymes facilitating the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (form I RuBisCO and phosphoribulokinase) to the same ancient Terrabacteria organism near the base of the bacterial domain. These phylogenies consistently showed that extant phototrophs ultimately derived light metabolism from this bacterium, the last phototroph common ancestor (LPCA). LPCA was a non-oxygen-generating (anoxygenic) phototroph that already possessed carbon fixation and two reaction centers, a type I analogous to extant forms and a primitive type II. Analyses also indicate chlorophototrophy originated before LPCA. We further reconstructed evolution of chlorophototrophs/chlorophototrophy post-LPCA, including vertical inheritance in Terrabacteria, the rise of oxygen-generating chlorophototrophy in one descendant branch near the Great Oxidation Event, and subsequent emergence of Cyanobacteria. These collectively unveil a detailed view of the coevolution of light metabolism and Bacteria having clear congruence with the geological record.</description>

                Vascular pathologies are prevalent in a broad spectrum of diseases, necessitating a deeper understanding of vascular biology, particularly in overcoming the oxygen and nutrient diffusion limit in tissue constructs. The evolution of vascularized tissues signifies a convergence of multiple scientific disciplines, encompassing the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into vascular cells, the development of advanced three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques, and the refinement of bioinks. These technologies are instrumental in creating intricate vascular networks essential for tissue viability, especially in thick, complex constructs. This review provides broad perspectives on the past, current state, and advancements in key areas, including the differentiation of hPSCs into specific vascular lineages, the potential and challenges of 3D bioprinting methods, and the role of innovative bioinks mimicking the native extracellular matrix. We also explore the integration of biophysical cues in vascularized tissues in vitro , highlighting their importance in stimulating vessel maturation and functionality. In this review, we aim to synthesize these diverse yet interconnected domains, offering a broad, multidisciplinary perspective on tissue vascularization. Advancements in this field will help address the global organ shortage and transform patient care.</description>

                We present a study of three highly non-radial solar wind events in which the azimuthal solar wind flow angle exceeds 6&#176; for one day or more. None of the events are associated with coronal mass ejections and co-rotating interaction regions observed at 1 AU. For all events, the solar wind outflows at 1 AU exhibit low velocity and density. Based on the significant increase in the oxygen charge state ratio of O7+/O6+ at 1 AU for all of the events, we have traced them back to the Sun and found that their source regions originated in active region and coronal hole (AR-CH) pairs mainly located at the central meridian. Furthermore, examining the dynamical evolutions in their source regions using both the Extreme ultra-violet Imaging Telescope and the Michelson Doppler Imager, we found that the changes taking place in AR-CH boundaries eventually disturbed the stable CH configurations, resulting in a reduction of the CH area and finally its disappearance, leaving only with the AR. Our study provides a possible explanation for discussing the origin of the prolonged and highly non-radial solar wind flows.</description>

                Abstract Spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiters measure their emission spectra at multiple orbital phases, thus enabling detailed characterisation of their atmospheres. Precise constraints on the atmospheric composition of these exoplanets offer insights into their formation and evolution. We analyse four phase-resolved emission spectra of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b, generated from a phase curve observed with the MIRI/LRS onboard the JWST, to retrieve its atmospheric properties. Using a parametric 2D temperature model and assuming a chemically homogeneous atmosphere within the observed pressure region, we simultaneously fit the four spectra to constrain the abundances of atmospheric constituents, thereby yielding more precise constraints than previous work that analysed each spectrum independently. Our analysis reveals statistically significant evidence of NH3 (4&#963;) in a hot Jupiter&#8217;s emission spectra for the first time, along with evidence of H2O (6.5&#963;), CO (3.1&#963;), and a non-detection of CH4. With our abundance constraints, we tentatively estimate the metallicity of WASP-43b at 0.6&#8722;6.5 &#215; solar and its C/O ratio at 0.6&#8722;0.9. Our findings offer vital insights into the atmospheric conditions and formation history of WASP-43b by simultaneously constraining the abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen-bearing species.</description>

                The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.</description>

                Abstract The advancement of renewable energy is intricately relied on the development of diverse sustainable electrochemical devices. Persuing exceptionally efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative, as it promises to significantly streamline the electrode fabrication process, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of these devices. Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalysts of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported intermetallic PtZn catalyst (PtZn&#8208;IMC@NC) are reported, which performs highly attractively toward the electrocatalysis of glycerol oxidation reactions (GOR), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Its effectiveness are demonstrated as electrocatalysts for both the anode and cathode in a hybrid acid/alkali direct glycerol fuel cell (AA&#8208;DGFC) and a hybrid acid/alkali glycerol&#8208;hydrogen electrolyzer (AA&#8208;GHEC). The AA&#8208;DGFC can release an impressive peak power density of 286.8 mW cm &#8722;2 , while the AA&#8208;GHEC achieves a noteworthy current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at a significantly low applied voltage of 0.47 V. Such intermetallic PtZn&#8208;based trifunctional electrocatalyst empowers them to establish a self&#8208;powered integrated electrochemical device with the AA&#8208;DGFC driving the AA&#8208;GHEC. This setup exemplifies efficient valorization of glycerol into formate in both cells and hydrogen production in electrolyzer device. This study sparks innovation across diverse applications of multifunctional electrocatalysts and infuses renewed momentum into the realm of advanced energy devices.</description>

      <title>Local and global expansivity in water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0203924</link>
      <description>Jan Philipp Gabriel, Robin Horstmann, Martin Tre&#223;, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399741098

                The supra-molecular structure of a liquid is strongly connected to its dynamics, which in turn control macroscopic properties such as viscosity. Consequently, detailed knowledge about how this structure changes with temperature is essential to understand the thermal evolution of the dynamics ranging from the liquid to the glass. Here, we combine infrared spectroscopy (IR) measurements of the hydrogen (H) bond stretching vibration of water with molecular dynamics simulations and employ a quantitative analysis to extract the inter-molecular H-bond length in a wide temperature range of the liquid. The extracted expansivity of this H-bond differs strongly from that of the average nearest neighbor distance of oxygen atoms obtained through a common conversion of mass density. However, both properties can be connected through a simple model based on a random loose packing of spheres with a variable coordination number, which demonstrates the relevance of supra-molecular arrangement. Furthermore, the exclusion of the expansivity of the inter-molecular H-bonds reveals that the most compact molecular arrangement is formed in the range of &#8764;316&#8722;331K (i.e., above the density maximum) close to the temperature of several pressure-related anomalies, which indicates a characteristic point in the supra-molecular arrangement. These results confirm our earlier approach to deduce inter-molecular H-bond lengths via IR in polyalcohols [Gabriel et al. J. Chem. Phys. 154, 024503 (2021)] quantitatively and open a new alley to investigate the role of inter-molecular expansion as a precursor of molecular fluctuations on a bond-specific level.</description>

      <title>Correlating Substrate Reactivity at Electrified Interfaces with the Electrolyte Structure in Synthetically Relevant Organic Solvent/Water Mixtures</title>

                Optimizing electrosynthetic reactions requires fine tuning of a vast chemical space, including charge transfer at electrocatalyst/electrode surfaces, engineering of mass transport limitations, and complex interactions of reactants and products with their environment. Hybrid electrolytes, in which supporting salt ions and substrates are dissolved in a binary mixture of organic solvent and water, represent a new piece of this complex puzzle as they offer a unique opportunity to harness water as the oxygen or proton source in electrosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that modulating water-organic solvent interactions drastically impacts the solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes. Combining various spectroscopies with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the size and composition of aqueous domains forming in hybrid electrolytes can be controlled. We demonstrate that water is more reactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous domains than when strongly interacting with solvent molecules, which originates from a change in reaction kinetics rather than a thermodynamic effect. We exemplify novel opportunities arising from this new knowledge for optimizing electrosynthetic reactions in hybrid electrolytes. For reactions proceeding first via the activation of water, fine tuning of aqueous domains impacts the kinetics and potentially the selectivity of the reaction. Instead, for organic substrates reacting prior to water, aqueous domains have no impact on the reaction kinetics, while selectivity may be affected. We believe that such a fine comprehension of solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes can be transposed to numerous electrosynthetic reactions.</description>

      <title>Microbial Autotrophy Recorded by Carbonate Dual Clumped Isotope Disequilibrium</title>

                Abstract The proliferation of microbial carbon fixation is a key control on the evolution of the biosphere and global carbon cycle. Most records of these metabolisms in ancient rocks come from organic matter or fossils, which are not always preserved. Here, we present a potential proxy for microbial carbon fixation (autotrophy) based on the isotopic composition of carbonate minerals. Autotrophs influence carbonate chemistry in the cellular microenvironment by decreasing CO 2 concentration and increasing the carbonate saturation state. This can induce rapid precipitation of carbonate minerals that are out of isotopic equilibrium with their environment. Recent work has identified disequilibrated dual clumped isotope compositions (&#8710; 47 and &#8710; 48 ) in the skeletal fossils of marine calcifying organisms. Here we test whether the same is true of non&#8208;skeletal carbonate fabrics associated with microbial autotrophs in modern and Eocene lakes. We found that microbial carbonate formed via autotrophic metabolism recorded lower &#8710; 47 and higher &#8710; 48 values (&#8722;&#8710; 47 /+&#8710; 48 ) than predicted for thermodynamic equilibrium mineral formation. Our findings are supported by models of dual clumped isotope kinetics in the DIC system, and disequilibrium in the oxygen isotope system. We hypothesize that the inverse trajectory away from the equilibrium line (+&#8710; 47 /&#8722;&#8710; 48 ) should be recorded by carbonates formed in association with alkalinizing heterotrophs, such as sulfate reducers. If so, carbonate dual clumped isotopes could be a powerful tool to identify the proliferation and rate of heterotrophic and autotrophic metabolisms in the carbonate rock record on Earth and (perhaps) other planets.</description>

                 BACKGROUND Research has demonstrated that hypoxia, a decrease in intracellular oxygen, is linked to multiple processes in the skin, including metabolic adaptation, cell survival, pathogenic microbe infection, immune response, tumorigenesis, and various diseases.   OBJECTIVE This paper aims to perform a thorough bibliometric analysis of studies of hypoxia in skin health and disease to identify the frontiers, hotspots, and evolution of these studies.   METHODS Articles about hypoxia in skin health and disease in the Web of Science Core Collection were gathered as of December 31, 2023. To find bursting keywords and references, VOSviewer was used to look at co-authorship and phrase co-occurrences and make visualizations of them.   RESULTS A total of 1,511 papers on hypoxia in skin health and disease were examined in this study. China, the United States, and Japan were the top three countries contributing to this topic, while the International Journal of Molecular Sciences was the journal with the most articles. In terms of prolific authors in the publications, Yuesheng Huang from China contributed the most articles. The terms "hypoxia," "angiogenesis," and "wound healing" were the ones that were used the most frequently. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was performed on the last ten years' worth of research on hypoxia in skin health and disease.   CONCLUSIONS The analysis identified the publications, nations, authors, institutions, and journals that were involved in this subject. These data offer a more comprehensive understanding of the area of research that has been conducted on hypoxia in skin health and disease. </description>

                Abstract Gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ), with an ultrawide bandgap corresponding to the deep ultraviolet (DUV) range, has attracted significant attention in optical filter&#8208;free photodetectors. In practical terms, DUV photodetectors employed in extreme conditions, for example, flame detection and space exploration, face the challenges of performance degradation caused by high/low&#8208;temperature transformation. Here, DUV photodetectors are tailored with high durability and stability by one&#8208;step&#8208;grown &#946;&#8208;Ga 2 O 3 films via pulsed laser deposition. A high&#8208;oxygen&#8208;pressure scheme effectively addresses the issue of film&#8208;free deposition at specifically high temperatures, facilitating the formation of polycrystalline high&#8208;resistivity &#946;&#8208;Ga 2 O 3 films. As a result, the devices exhibit outstanding performance, including a low dark current (4.4 pA @30 V), high photoresponsivity (147.36 A W &#8722;1 ), and fast response time (3.1/22.6 ms). Additionally, the photoresponse performance shows minimal degradation at high temperatures up to 300 &#176;C and even improves at low temperatures down to &#8722;100 &#176;C, ranking it among the most robust DUV photodetectors. The mechanism of photoresponse, involving the exciton formation, bandgap evolution, carrier&#8208;phonon scatter, etc., is also elucidated in a wide temperature range. This work provides an efficient solution for developing robust Ga 2 O 3 DUV photodetectors with excellent performance for extreme&#8208;condition applications.</description>

      <title>Fast, Efficient Tailoring Growth of Nanocrystalline Diamond Films by Fine-Tuning of Gas-Phase Composition Using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17122976</link>
      <description>Chi Tang, A.J.S. Fernandes, Margarida Fac&#227;o, Alexandre F. Carvalho, Weixia Chen, Haijun Hou, F.M. Costa, Materials. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399778914

                Nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) films are attractive for many applications due to their smooth surfaces while holding the properties of diamond. However, their growth rate is generally low using common Ar/CH4 with or without H2 chemistry and strongly dependent on the overall growth conditions using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). In this work, incorporating a small amount of N2 and O2 additives into CH4/H2 chemistry offered a much higher growth rate of NCD films, which is promising for some applications. Several novel series of experiments were designed and conducted to tailor the growth features of NCD films by fine-tuning of the gas-phase compositions with different amounts of nitrogen and oxygen addition into CH4/H2 gas mixtures. The influence of growth parameters, such as the absolute amount and their relative ratios of O2 and N2 additives; substrate temperature, which was adjusted by two ways and inferred by simulation; and microwave power on NCD formation, was investigated. Short and long deposition runs were carried out to study surface structural evolution with time under identical growth conditions. The morphology, crystalline and optical quality, orientation, and texture of the NCD samples were characterized and analyzed. A variety of NCD films of high average growth rates ranging from 2.1 &#956;m/h up to 6.7 &#956;m/h were successfully achieved by slightly adjusting the O2/CH4 amounts from 6.25% to 18.75%, while that of N2 was kept constant. The results clearly show that the beneficial use of fine-tuning of gas-phase compositions offers a simple and effective way to tailor the growth characteristics and physical properties of NCD films for optimizing the growth conditions to envisage some specific applications.</description>

      <title>A time series analysis of transparent exopolymer particle distributions and C:N stoichiometry in the subtropical North Pacific: a key process in net community production and preformed nitrate anomalies?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1416</link>

                Abstract. Within the oligotrophic subtropical oceans, summertime DIC drawdown despite nutrient limitation in surface waters and subsurface oxygen consumption in the absence of Redfieldian stoichiometric nitrate release are two phenomena still awaiting a full mechanistic characterization. The distribution, intensity and seasonality of these phenomena are identified with preformed nitrate as a tracer, where negative preformed nitrate (NPN) anomalies below the euphotic zone correspond to oxygen consumption without Redfieldian NO3- release, and positive performed nitrate (PPN) anomalies found within the upper 100 m occur where O2 is produced without stoichiometric NO3- drawdown. Many processes that may contribute to these anomalies including N2 fixation, non-Redfieldian DOM cycling, vertically migrating phytoplankton, heterotrophic NO3- uptake and vertical NO3- injection events have been measured or modelled, yet generally cannot fully account for the magnitudes of preformed nitrate anomalies and excess DIC drawdown observed in many oligotrophic subtropical waters. One other candidate process that may contribute to both phenomena is the formation of carbon-rich transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and Coomassie-stainable particles (CSP) from dissolved organic precursors in surface waters and their subsequent remineralization below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). However, few data exist to quantify exopolymer production and vertical distributions in oligotrophic oceans over an annual cycle, which is necessary to understand their potential role in the evolution of seasonal preformed nitrate anomalies and DIC drawdown. To investigate the significance of exopolymer formation and export to North Pacific subtropical gyre biogeochemistry, we undertook a multi-year time-series (Jan 2020 &#8211; Sep 2022) analysis of TEP, CSP and total dissolved polysaccharides concentrations at Station ALOHA (22&#176; 45&#8217;,158&#176; W), and along a transect from 22&#176; 45&#8217; to 31&#176; N to measure latitudinal variability in June 2021. Exopolymer C:N stoichiometry at Station ALOHA varied between 16.4 &#8211; 34.3, with values being more carbon-rich in summer; ratios were higher (32&#8211;38) toward the gyre centre at 31&#176; N. TEP concentrations were consistently elevated in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn (4&#8211;8 &#181;M C after carbon conversion) at Station ALOHA with lower concentrations (~1.5&#8211;3 &#181;M C) and more uniform vertical distribution during winter, indicating that TEP accumulated in surface waters may vertically sink and be exported with winter mixing. The accumulation of TEP in surface waters through Spring&#8211;Autumn and its subsequent export may account for 6.5&#8211;20 % of net community production (NCP), helping reduce the estimated imbalance of N supply and N demand at this site to &lt;10 %. The upper ocean TEP cycle may explain 22&#8211;67 % of the observed PPN/NPN anomalies, helping to close the C, N, and O2 budgets at station ALOHA, while leaving room for significant contributions from other processes such as vertically migrating phytoplankton and heterotrophic nitrate uptake to be further validated. These results suggest that exopolymer production and cycling may be more important to open ocean carbon biogeochemistry than previously expected, with considerable seasonality and spatial variability influenced by physical processes and phytoplankton activity.</description>

      <title>The Metallicity and Carbon-to-oxygen Ratio of the Ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b from Gemini-S/IGRINS</title>

                Abstract Measurements of the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal details about their formation and evolution. Recently, high-resolution cross-correlation analysis has emerged as a method of precisely constraining the C/O ratios of hot Jupiter atmospheres. We present two transits of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-76b observed between 1.4 and 2.4 &#956; m with the high-resolution Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer on the Gemini-S telescope. We detected the presence of H 2 O, CO, and OH at signal-to-noise ratios of 6.93, 6.47, and 3.90, respectively. We performed two retrievals on this data set. A free retrieval for abundances of these three species retrieved a volatile metallicity of       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.70   &#8722; 0.93   + 1.27    , consistent with the stellar value, and a supersolar carbon-to-oxygen ratio of C/O   =    0.80   &#8722; 0.11   + 0.07    . We also ran a chemically self-consistent grid retrieval, which agreed with the free retrieval within 1 &#963; but favored a slightly more substellar metallicity and solar C/O ratio (       C + O   H      = &#8722;   0.74   &#8722; 0.17   + 0.23    and C/O   =    0.59   &#8722; 0.14   + 0.13    ). A variety of formation pathways may explain the composition of WASP-76b. Additionally, we found systemic ( V sys ) and Keplerian ( K p ) velocity offsets which were broadly consistent with expectations from 3D general circulation models of WASP-76b, with the exception of a redshifted V sys for H 2 O. Future observations to measure the phase-dependent velocity offsets and limb differences at high resolution on WASP-76b will be necessary to understand the H 2 O velocity shift. Finally, we find that the population of exoplanets with precisely constrained C/O ratios generally trends toward super-solar C/O ratios. More results from high-resolution observations or JWST will serve to further elucidate any population-level trends.</description>

                Cancers can manifest large variations in tumor phenotypes due to genetic and microenvironmental factors, which has motivated the development of quantitative radiomics-based image analysis with the aim to robustly classify tumor phenotypes in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be particularly helpful in elucidating the metabolic profiles of tumors. However, the relatively low resolution, high noise, and limited PET data availability make it difficult to study the relationship between the microenvironment properties and metabolic tumor phenotype as seen on the images. Most of previously proposed digital PET phantoms of tumors are static, have an over-simplified morphology, and lack the link to cellular biology that ultimately governs the tumor evolution. In this work, we propose a novel method to investigate the relationship between microscopic tumor parameters and PET image characteristics based on the computational simulation of tumor growth. We use a hybrid, multiscale, stochastic mathematical model of cellular metabolism and proliferation to generate simulated cross-sections of tumors in vascularized normal tissue on a microscopic level. The generated longitudinal tumor growth sequences are converted to PET images with realistic resolution and noise. By changing the biological parameters of the model, such as the blood vessel density and conditions for necrosis, distinct tumor phenotypes can be obtained. The simulated cellular maps were compared to real histology slides of SiHa and WiDr xenografts imaged with Hoechst 33342 and pimonidazole. As an example application of the proposed method, we simulated six tumor phenotypes that contain various amounts of hypoxic and necrotic regions induced by a lack of oxygen and glucose, including phenotypes that are distinct on the microscopic level but visually similar in PET images. We computed 22 standardized Haralick texture features for each phenotype, and identified the features that could best discriminate the phenotypes with varying image noise levels. We demonstrated that &#8220;cluster shade&#8221; and &#8220;difference entropy&#8221; are the most effective and noise-resilient features for microscopic phenotype discrimination. Longitudinal analysis of the simulated tumor growth showed that radiomics analysis can be beneficial even in small lesions with a diameter of 3.5&#8211;4 resolution units, corresponding to 8.7&#8211;10.0 mm in modern PET scanners. Certain radiomics features were shown to change non-monotonically with tumor growth, which has implications for feature selection for tracking disease progression and therapy response.</description>

      <title>Quartz textures, trace elements, fluid inclusions, and in-situ oxygen isotopes from Aktogai porphyry Cu deposit, Kazakhstan</title>

                Abstract The Paleozoic Aktogai Group in Kazakhstan ranks among the thirty largest porphyry Cu deposits globally. The Aktogai deposit is the largest one in the Aktogai Group and is characterized by intensive potassic alteration where the dominant orebody occurred. However, its mineralization processes remain unclear. Our investigation focused on the texture, trace elements, fluid inclusions, and in-situ oxygen isotopes of the quartz from the ore-related tonalite porphyry and associated potassic alteration at Aktogai to trace the deposit&#8217;s mineralization processes. Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry, fluid inclusion microthermometry, and geological characteristics indicate that the ore-related magma at Aktogai originated from a shallow magma chamber at ~1.9&#177;0.5 kbar (~7.2&#177;1.9 km) and intruded as the tonalite porphyry stock at ~1.7-2.4 km. The potassic alteration and associated Cu mineralization comprise five types of veins (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C) and two types of altered rocks (biotite and K-feldspar). Among them, nine types of hydrothermal quartz were identified from early to late: (1) VQA1 in A1 veins and RQbt in biotite altered rocks, (2) VQA2 in A2 veins and RQkfs in K-feldspar altered rocks, (3) VQB1 in B1 veins and VQB2E in B2 veins, and (4) quartz associated with Cu-Fe sulfides (VQB2L, VQBC, and VQC) in B and C veins. Titanium contents of the quartz decreased, while Al/Ti ratios increased from early to late. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and mineral thermometers reveal that VQA1, RQbt, and hydrothermal biotite formed under high-temperature (~470-560 &#176;C) and ductile conditions. VQA2, RQkfs, VQB1, and hydrothermal K-feldspar formed during the transition stage from ductile to brittle, with temperatures of ~350-540 &#176;C. The rapid decrease in pressure from lithostatic to hydrostatic pressure led to fluid boiling and minor involvement of meteoric water (~11-14 %) in the mineralizing fluid. Extensive recrystallization in VQA1 to VQB1 was associated with repeated cleavage and healing of the intrusion. With cooling, K-feldspar decomposition and hydrolysis increased. Fluid cooling and water-rock reactions resulted in the co-precipitation of Cu-Fe sulfides, white mica, chlorite, VQBC, and VQC, with temperatures of ~275-370 &#176;C and brittle conditions. The Paleozoic Aktogai deposit exhibits formation depths and fluid evolution processes similar to Mesozoic and Cenozoic PCDs worldwide. The close association between Cu-Fe sulfides and later quartz formed under intermediate-temperature conditions at Aktogai implies that Cu-Fe sulfides are not precipitated during early high-temperature conditions in porphyry Cu deposits.</description>
