                Mixed-anion compounds have recently attracted attention as solid-state materials that exhibit properties unattainable with those of their single-anion counterparts. However, the use of mixed-anion compounds to control the morphology and engineer the crystal facets of electrocatalysts has been limited because their synthesis method is still immature. This study explored the electrocatalytic properties of a Pb-Fe oxyfluoride, Pb</description>

      <title>On the Quest for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts Based on Layered Double Hydroxides: An Electrochemical and Chemometric Combined Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aesr.202400233</link>
      <description>Isacco Gualandi, Elisa Musella, Giulia Costa, Massimo Gazzano, Erika Scavetta, Sergio Zappoli, Domenica Tonelli, Advanced Energy and Sustainability Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404325990

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysis. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is essential to achieve the commercialization of devices for the transition toward sustainable energy solutions. Herein, ternary layer double hydroxides (LDHs) are synthesized and characterized as electrocatalysts for OER using a potentiodynamic electrochemical deposition method on Grafoil. A chemometric approach based on experimental design is employed to rationalize the effort in the investigation of the LDHs which are based on Ni, Co, and Fe. The deposited films are characterized using cyclic voltammetry and X&#8208;ray diffraction to determine peak currents and potentials, and crystal size. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performances are assessed by linear sweep voltammetry in 1M KOH from which the Tafel slope and onset potential are calculated. The obtained data are used to derive models describing the material properties and electrocatalyst performance as a function of the electrolyte composition used during the LDHs electrodeposition. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the electrocatalyst composition and its OER activity, enabling the design of more efficient and sustainable electrochemical systems for energy applications.</description>

      <title>Producing Supersaturated Dissolved Oxygen Seawater by Photosynthesis of &lt;i&gt;Ulva&lt;/i&gt; sp. and Its Applications</title>

                In order to create new value in biomass production using sterile Ulva with high production efficiency, we selected sterile Ulva with high culture stability from the coast of Imari City in Japan and investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen through photosynthesis using the sterile Ulva . In the cultivation of sterile Ulva , we investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) by controlling conditions such as aeration, NO 3 &#8208;N concentration, and population density. As a result, we found that under the cultivation control conditions we found, DO reached about 3.8 times the saturation concentration after 3 h. It was found that this high level of DO can be maintained if the supersaturated DO seawater obtained here is properly sealed. Seawater containing high levels of DO is essential for the cultivation of oysters and shellfish, which also prefer a growth temperature of 20&#176;C&#8722;25&#176;C. Therefore, from the perspective of creating new value in biomass production, we developed a new system for simultaneously cultivating sterile Ulva and cultivating oysters.</description>

                Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</description>

                Abstract Engineering metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8210;O) interactions for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tuning the coordination geometry of metal sites is crucial for improving catalytic performance, which remains unexplored, especially in structurally diverse phosphate&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, two NaCoPO 4 (NCP) polymorphs with distinct metal coordinations: orthorhombic&#8208; Pnma (CoO 6 ) and hexagonal&#8208;P 6 5 (CoO 4 ) denoted as O&#8208;NCP and H&#8208;NCP, respectively are synthesized through unique quenching&#8208;based synthesis, to investigate the impact of coordination geometry on M&#8210;O covalency and OER performance. The CoO 4 (H&#8208;NCP) polymorph delivered superior OER activity with low overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 (&#951; 10 = 303 mV) and long&#8208;term stability than CoO 6 &#8208;based O&#8208;NCP. Spectroscopic and computational studies linked the superior activity of CoO 4 to higher Co&#8210;O covalency, enhanced metal electronic states near the Fermi level, and improved electrochemical reconstruction. Further, M&#8210;O covalency regulated OER mechanism, where high&#8208;covalent CoO 4 follows conventional concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer pathway, while CoO 6 entails a non&#8208;concerted pathway, where the lattice oxygen participation remains unfavorable due to downshifted O 2p band center. Further, OER&#8208;active tetrahedral metal is demonstrated in a high&#8208;entropy catalyst requiring lower &#951; 10 of &#8776;284 mV. This study unlocks a unique strategy for designing next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with superior activity and durability, harnessing the interplay between metal coordination and metal&#8208;oxygen covalency.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Oxygen Evolution Performance of NiFeOx Semitransparent Electrocatalysts Applicable to Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Device</title>

                In photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, semiconductor&#8208;based photoelectrodes can improve reaction rates and durability by incorporating cocatalysts that serve as active sites for the water splitting process. However, achieving both high light transmittance and efficient catalytic activity is essential for these cocatalysts. This study aimed to optimize the surface loading of semitransparent NiFeOx thin&#8208;film electrocatalysts to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rates while maintaining high light transmittance. NiFeOx thin films were deposited on fluorine&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) transparent conductive substrates, and the relationship between the NiFeOx loading amount (&#915;) and the OER rate was examined using electrochemical techniques. The OER rate of NiFeOx on FTO (NiFeOx/FTO) was the highest at a &#915; value of 0.20 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2. To further explore the connection between this optimized &#915; and PEC activity, the impact of &#915; on the PEC OER performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 semitransparent photoanodes was evaluated as a model system. Applying the optimized &#915; of NiFeOx to modify the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 surface also led to enhanced PEC OER performance. These findings highlight the critical role of surface design, specifically the optimization of cocatalyst loading and electrocatalytic activity, in improving PEC water splitting efficiency, providing valuable guidelines for future semitransparent photoelectrode development.</description>

                Abstract The application of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the electro&#8208;catalysis of heterogeneous structures is limited by the problems of low electrical conductivity and poor mechanical strength due to the complex synthesis process, although their high specific surface area and controllable structure. In this study, a method involving metal precipitation and ligand reaction is used during the electrochemical corrosion of hydroxides/oxy&#8208;hydroxides to obtain ZIF&#8208;67 in situ. The in situ growth technology not only effectively addresses the bonding strength and material conductivity challenges in the heterostructure between MOFs and the substrate but also enhances the catalyst's surface area and activity. Additionally, the exposure and protection of Co 4+ by ZIF&#8208;67 contribute to the electrocatalyst's performance, demonstrating a low overpotential (&#951; 100 ) of 293 mV, a Tafel slope of 25.8 mV dec &#8722;1 , and a charge transfer resistance of 3.9 &#937;, with long&#8208;term robustness proven in continuous stability test exceeding 75 000 s under the superhigh current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work on binder&#8208;free in situ growth of MOFs not only provides relevant theoretical insights and experimental experience for cost&#8208;effective and controllable production of MOF&#8208;based catalysts but also offers ideas for the development of future electrocatalysts by exploring the exposure and protection of active site using MOFs materials.</description>

                Abstract The low activity of ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) and the rapid dissolution of the ruthenium (Ru) site during acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high current density restricts its application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this work, a series of rare&#8208;earth (RE) elements doped RuO 2 nanorods is developed as high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that RE doping regulates the local coordination environment around Ru sites, lowers the valance of Ru, and shortens the Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ru(M) bond length, which enhances structural stability. Among the RE&#8208;RuO 2 samples, Sm&#8208;RuO 2 exhibits remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 283 mV to reach 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintained stability for over 140 h at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Moreover, the PEM electrolyzer using Sm&#8208;RuO 2 as the anode can be stably operated at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 for 15 h. Electrochemical analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy show that Sm doping lowers the d &#8208;band center, reduces the adsorption energy of O intermediates to enhance the OER activity, and restrains excessive oxidation of Ru sites while stabilizing lattice oxygen during the OER process, thereby enhancing OER stability. This work offers valuable insights into improving the stability of metal oxide catalysts in acidic electrolytes.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is long constrained by the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and rational spin&#8208;state manipulation holds great promise to break through this bottleneck. Low&#8208;spin Fe 3+ (LS, t 2g 5 e g 0 ) species are identified as highly active sites for OER in theory, whereas it is still a formidable challenge to construct experimentally. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for the effective construction of LS Fe 3+ in NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) by introducing multiple defects, which induce coordination unsaturation over Fe sites and thus enlarge their d orbital splitting energy. The as&#8208;obtained catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER performance with an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 244 mV at the industrially required current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is 110 mV lower than that of the conventional NiFe&#8208;LDH with high&#8208;spin Fe 3+ (HS, t 2g 3 e g 2 ) and superior to most previously reported NiFe&#8208;based catalysts. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies reveal that LS Fe 3+ configuration effectively reduces the adsorption strength of the O* intermediate compared with that of the HS case, thereby altering the rate&#8208;determining step from (O* &#8594; OOH*) to (OH* &#8594; O*) of OER and lowering its reaction energy barrier. This work paves a new avenue for developing efficient spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysts for OER and beyond.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Catalytic Sites in High&#8208;Entropy Metal Hydroxide Organic Framework for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202408114</link>

                Abstract The integration of multiple elements in a high&#8208;entropy state is crucial in the design of high&#8208;performance, durable electrocatalysts. High&#8208;entropy metal hydroxide organic frameworks (HE&#8208;MHOFs) are synthesized under mild solvothermal conditions. This novel crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) features a random, homogeneous distribution of cations within high&#8208;entropy hydroxide layers. HE&#8208;MHOF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8776;1.64 V RHE , and demonstrates remarkable durability, maintaining a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for over 100 h. Notably, HE&#8208;MHOF outperforms precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts despite containing only &#8776;60% OER active metals. Ab initio calculations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the high&#8208;entropy catalyst contains active sites that facilitate a multifaceted OER mechanism. This study highlights the benefits of high&#8208;entropy MOFs in developing noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts, reducing reliance on precious metals, lowering metal loading (especially for Ni, Co, and Mn), and ultimately reducing costs for sustainable water electrolysis technologies.</description>

                Abstract Neither electrocatalytic activity nor structural stability is inconsequential in water electrolysis. Unfortunately, they have to be compromised in practice, especially in the anodic redox chemistry of lattice oxygen. Herein, the discovery of a La 1&#8722; x Ce x FeO 3 perovskite is presented which shows both good stability and high catalytic activity. Using advanced operando characterizations, it is identified that the self&#8208;healing evolution of the La 1&#8722; x Ce x FeO 3 perovskite plays a key role during water oxidation in the lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) pathway. Unlike irreversible reconstruction, the formation of reconstructed active&#8208;phase &#945; &#8208;FeOOH is reversed by re&#8208;crystallization of surface La 1&#8722; x Ce x FeO 3 upon return to noncatalytic conditions. The self&#8208;healing transformation of the &#945; &#8208;FeOOH termination layer on the stable La 1&#8722; x Ce x FeO 3 core imparts remarkable long&#8208;term stability as well as excellent electrocatalytic performance. As a result, a composition La 0.9 Ce 0.1 FeO 3 @FeOOH is designed that exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 257 and 312 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. The findings provide insight into self&#8208;healing behavior toward engineering perovskite oxides for efficient and stable oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract The practical capacity of lithium-oxygen batteries falls short of their ultra-high theoretical value. Unfortunately, the fundamental understanding and enhanced design remain lacking, as the issue is complicated by the coupling processes between Li 2 O 2 nucleation, growth, and multi-species transport. Herein, we redefine the relationship between the microscale Li 2 O 2 behaviors and the macroscopic electrochemical performance, emphasizing the importance of the inherent modulating ability of Li + ions through a synergy of visualization techniques and cross-scale quantification. We find that Li 2 O 2 particle distributed against the oxygen gradient signifies a compatibility match for the nucleation and transport kinetics, thus enabling the output of the electrode&#8217;s maximum capacity and providing a basis for evaluating operating protocols for future applications. In this case, a 150% capacity enhancement is further achieved through the development of a universalizing methodology. This work opens the door for the rules and control of energy conversion in metal-air batteries, greatly accelerating their path to commercialization.</description>

                Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.</description>

                Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8208; into the intermediate layer of CoFe Hydroxide improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8208; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210 mV and 251mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for 120 h in 1M KOH. F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion&#8208;doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key electrochemical redox reaction involved in metal&#8211;air batteries and water-splitting devices. Reducing the energy barrier of these reactions accentuates the necessity in designing competent electrocatalysts. There is an urgent demand for affordable and durable catalysts utilizing non-noble metals, specifically Ni, Co, and Fe, for the OER. In this context, three following cobalt(II) coordination frameworks based on a pyridyl carboxylic acid ligand were synthesized: [Co3(&#956;3-OH)(PCA)4(DMF)2(H2O)](NO3)&#183;DMF&#183;3H2O (1), [Co3(&#956;3-OH)(PCA)4(EtOH)3](NO3)&#183;3EtOH&#183;3H2O (2), and [Co3(&#956;3-OH)(PCA)4(DMA)2(H2O)] (ClO4)&#183;DMA&#183;H2O) (3) using a solvothermal method. The single-crystal diffraction studies confirm the similarity in the three-center cobalt secondary building unit (SBU) and the final 3D topology. These frameworks are investigated as potential catalysts for the OER under alkaline (1 M KOH) conditions. Compound 1 shows extraordinary OER activity demonstrating an overpotential value of 0.37 V at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 78.9 mV. The alternation in the coordination sphere resulting from the difference in coordinated solvent emerges as an intriguing reason contributing to the exceptional activity of a coordination network. The effective electronic modulation within the cobalt trinuclear center induced by the changes in the coordination sphere has lowered the free energy barrier for the desorption of the oxygen produced. This work emphasizes the significant influence and effect of the coordination environment in catalytic activity, serving as a template for designing advanced electrocatalysts that are free from noble metals.</description>

                Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with single- and odd-numbered layers is a novel piezocatalyst, and its piezocatalytic molecular oxygen activation is considered a promising and low-cost strategy for environmental remediation. In this study, the odd-numbered layers of Co-doped MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets were successfully fabricated, which decomposed tetracycline by 99.8% in 15 min through shaking vibration. Moreover, to verify the enhanced piezoelectric catalytic activity of MoS2 via the doping effect, molecular oxygen activation properties were predicted through DFT calculation and monitored by generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) evolution. In addition, the primary reactive species responsible for the degradation of tetracycline pollutants were also investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Self-Sufficiency System Enables Singlet Oxygen Production for Water Decontamination</title>

                Electrochemical advanced oxidation process represents a promising strategy for water decontamination, but the parasitic anodic side oxygen evolution reaction always causes a low energy utilization efficiency. In this study, we address this limitation of developing an electrocatalytic oxygen self-sufficiency system. This system established an integrated electrocatalytic process that ran solely on O2 produced by anodic oxygen evolution, followed by transformation of O2 into H2O2 at the nanoconfined Fe2O3 cathode, which then led to the generation of 1O2. The performance of water decontamination was evaluated using tetracycline (TC), bisphenol A (BPA), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as model emerging contaminants. When anodic polarization was applied at 2.0 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode, the removal of TC, BPA, and PFOA with a flow rate of 10 mL min&#8211;1 could reach 90.1%, 92.1%, and 62.2%, respectively. Electron spin resonance and radical quenching results indicated 1O2 as the main reactive oxygen species for TC and BPA decomposition, whereas PFOA decomposition was contributed by direct electron transfer. The intermediate toxicity was predicted to be reduced, and the excellent anti-interference ability of this system was proved in actual water. These findings suggest a reagent-free and oxygen-dependent sustainable system for water decontamination.</description>

                In green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, catalysts with multiscale nanostructures synthesized by compositing micro-heterojunctions and nanoporous structures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Moreover, they are the most promising non-noble metal catalysts. Herein, FeNi-based aerogels with a three-dimensional nanoporous structure and amorphous matrix embedded with FeNi3 nanoclusters were synthesized via wet chemical reduction coprecipitation. The FeNi3 nanoclusters and the FeNi-based amorphous matrix formed a crystalline&#8211;amorphous heterojunction. These aerogels exhibited excellent OER performance and electrocatalytic stability in alkaline electrolytes. In 1 mol/L of KOH electrolyte, the as-synthesized aerogel exhibited an overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of only 46 mV dec&#8722;1.

      <title>Evaluating the effect of oxygen vacancies on the OER activity of LaNiO3</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-40vsz</link>
      <description>Chuanmu Tian, Danni Wang, Kelvin H. L. Zhang, Jan P. Hofmann, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404506579

                In this work, we have investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies on the surface composition, electronic structure and OER performance of LaNiO3. The results show that the OER performance of LaNiO3 can be improved both by lowering the oxygen partial pressure during film growth or annealing the thin film in H2 atmosphere. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) shows a significant increase in La ratio on the LaNiO3 surface after the introduction of oxygen defects, especially after H2 treatment where Ni/La reaches 3.5:1. The presence of oxygen vacancies leads to the aggregation of Ni on the surface of LaNiO3, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the OER performance of LaNiO3. In addition, the OER activity of both LaNiO3 and oxygen vacancy rich LaNiO3 decreases upon cyclic voltammetry (CV) between +1.0 V and +1.5 V vs. RHE with proceeding cycle numbers. XPS results reveal that the CV treatments lead to the decrease of Ni concentration at the LaNiO3 surface, which is an important factor for the decrease in the OER performance of LaNiO3 as well as oxygen vacancy rich LaNiO3.</description>

                Abstract Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (Ir SA &#8208;MnO x ) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e &#8722; pathway on high&#8208;valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O &#9472; O coupling. The Ir SA &#8208;MnO x therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635 V) between OER potential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and ORR half&#8208;wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The use of efficient and affordable non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions is vital for replacing and widely implementing new energy sources. Nevertheless, improving the catalytic performance of these non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal bifunctional electrocatalysts continues to be a major challenge. In this article, an optimized Se&#8208;incorporated bulk CoS 2 @MoS 2 heterostructure grown on the surface of carbon nanotubes is reported. The resulting Se&#8208;CoS 2 @MoS 2 /CNTs exhibit robust bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, with low overpotentials of 85 and 240 mV @ 10 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 for HER and OER, respectively. The materials exhibit superior long&#8208;term stability of over 145 h, surpassing most electrocatalysts of similar type. This enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effect at the interface between the MoS 2 and CoS 2 phases, abundant active sites, and high active surface area, which collectively improves the electron&#8208;transfer efficiency during the reaction process. Furthermore, the incorporation of the amorphous state of Se into the heterostructure yields a change in the crystallinity of the heterostructure in the electronic structure, which optimizes the adsorption and activation energy barriers of the catalytic intermediate. This study thus presents a promising approach to regulating anion doping in bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Water electrolyzer is crucial for producing clean hydrogen, but the traditional approach faces challenges owing to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) slow kinetics at the anode. Hybrid water splitting replaces the OER with the oxidation of an organic molecule to enhance hydrogen production along with value&#8208;added products. The scarcity of affordable and highly effective catalysts remains a major challenge. MXene, a 2D nanomaterial, has gained substantial attention for its enviable properties, for instance high conductivity, hydrophilicity, and substantial surface area. This review discusses experimental methods for synthesizing MXene and MXene&#8208;based nanocomposites. Furthermore, the small molecules oxidation such as benzyl alcohol, methanol, ethanol, urea, hydrazine, furfural, and formic acid as alternatives to the oxygen evolution reaction is examined. Finally, an understanding of imminent research and the development of MXene&#8208;associated materials in electrocatalytic applications are presented.</description>

                Generation of clean hydrogen fuel from renewable source like water by electrocatalytic water splitting is an advanced energy conversion technology. The idea of water splitting attracts the researcher to focus on the synthesis of active and stable catalysts. We modulated nickel ferrite using different surfactants and developed an active two&#8208;dimensional (2D), economic and sturdy catalyst for the study of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic electrolytic solution. Nickel ferrite with CTAB named as NF(C), with ascorbic acid named as NF(A) and with oxalic acid named as NF(O) and Nickel ferrite without surfactant is named as NF. NF(O) having 2D structure shows better catalytic activity among all. The catalytic activity of NF(O) was further enhanced through reduction process. We reduced NF(O) using hydrazine hydrate along with ultrasonication power treatment to induce vacancy in the material namely Vo&#8208; NF(O). Vo&#8208; NF(O) exhibits low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA/cm2 with Tafel slope of 25 mV/dec and stability of 18 h. Creation of vacancy boosts the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst by increasing the surface area and number of reactive sites of the catalyst which improve electrical conductivity, thus facilitating the transfer of charge.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity of perovskite oxides across conductivity ranges using thin film model systems</title>

                The development of efficient electrocatalysts in water electrolysis is essential to decrease the high overpotentials especially at the anode where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. However, establishing catalyst design rules to find optimal electrocatalysts is a substantial challenge. Complex oxides, which are often considered as suitable OER catalysts, can exhibit vastly different conductivity values, making it challenging to separate intrinsic catalytic activities from internal transport limitations. Here, we systematically decouple the limitations arising from electrical bulk resistivity, contact resistances to the catalyst support, and intrinsic OER catalytic properties using a systematic epitaxial thin film model catalyst approach. We investigate the influence of the resistivity of the three perovskite oxides LaNiO3-&#948; (3.7x10-4 &#8486;cm), La0.67Sr0.33MnO3-&#948; (2.7x10-3 &#8486;cm) and La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-&#948;, (0.57 &#8486;cm) on the observed catalytic activity. We tune the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk by comparing insulating and conductive substrates. The conducting substrate reduces the electron pathway through the catalyst bulk from millimeter to nanometer length scale. As we show, for the large electron pathways, the observed catalytic activity scales with the resistivity because of a highly inhomogeneous lateral current density distribution. At the same time, even on the conducting substrate (Nb-doped SrTiO3), large contact resistances occur that limit the determination of intrinsic catalytic properties. By inserting interfacial dipole layers (in this case LaAlO3) we lifted these interface resistances, allowing us to reveal the intrinsic catalytic properties of all examined catalysts. We find that La0.6Ca0.4FeO3-&#948; and LaNiO3-&#948; exhibit a similar intrinsic overpotential of 0.36 V at 0.1 mA/cm2, while their resistivities differ by three orders of magnitude. This finding shows that optimizing the electron pathway of OER catalyst can lead the way to find new structure-activity relationships and to identify high-activity catalysts even if the electronic resistance is high.</description>

                The efficiency of electrochemical water splitting is constrained by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which suffers from high energy barriers, sluggish kinetics, and significant overpotential. Designing affordable and efficient electrocatalysts for the OER remains a key goal for advancing the hydrogen economy, with transitional metals like Co, Ni, and Cu gaining significant attention as promising alternatives due to their redox properties, abundance, and economy. The oxidation step of Mn+ &#8594; M(n+1)+ (M = Co, Ni, Cu) is the key intermediate step that produces the active species (M-OOH) formation, and thereby lowers the energy barrier and enhances the kinetics of the OER. However, the oxidation of Mn+ &#8594; M(n+1)+ creates charge-transfer orbitals near the Fermi energy level, which is fundamentally challenging. In this study, through structural and surface analyses, we demonstrate that the highly reducible CeO2 support in the Ce1&#8211;xMxO2&#8722;&#948; solid-solution effectively facilitates the Mn+ &#8594; M(n+1)+ oxidation process and the evolution of lattice oxygen during the OER. Among the three transition metals, the presence of the Ni3+ species along with the surface oxygen vacancy promoted the formation of -OOH surface intermediates and maximized the OER activity in Ce0.95Ni0.05O2&#8722;&#948; catalyst.</description>

                The application of seawater splitting is crucial for hydrogen production; therefore, efficient electrocatalysts are necessary to prevent chlorine evolution and severe corrosion. A synergistic method is employed on CoFe LDH by integrating a conductive Ti3C2Tx MXene layer and subsequently applying anionic modulation. Robust metal-substrate interaction along with subsequent phosphidation facilitates efficient electron transfer and optimises the electronic structure of Co and Fe sites. The CoFe-P-1000@Ti3C2Tx/CC demonstrates commendable electrochemical performance, requiring overpotentials of 106.6 mV and 276 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm-2 in 1M KOH electrolyte, while 292 mV is necessary for OER in a simulated seawater electrolyte (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl). Furthermore, the CoFe-P-1000@Ti3C2Tx/CC exhibits an encouraging cell voltage of 1.59 V (j = 10 mA cm-2) for comprehensive alkaline seawater splitting, maintaining exceptional stability for over 50 hours.</description>

                Laser-structuring techniques like Direct Laser Interference Patterning show great potential for optimizing electrodes for water electrolysis. Therefore, a systematic experimental study based on statistical design of experiments is performed to analyze the influence of the spatial period and the aspect ratio between spatial period and structure depth on the electrode performance for pure Ni electrodes. The electrochemically active surface area could be increased by a factor of 12 compared to a non-structured electrode. For oxygen evolution reaction, a significantly lower onset potential and overpotential ($\approx$-164 mV at 100 mA/cm$^2$) is found. This is explained by a lower number of active nucleation sites and, simultaneously, larger detached bubbles, resulting in reduced electrode blocking and thus, lower ohmic resistance. It is found that the spatial distance between the laser-structures is the decisive processing parameter for the improvement of the electrode performance.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is widely recognized as a bottleneck in the kinetics and activity of decomposition water. Unique geometric design and compositional regulation are important technologies for achieving significant activity and excellent kinetics, but they continue to face obstacles in reaction thermodynamics and kinetic response. Here, a "needle mushroom" shaped Cu2O-NiCo2O4 heterostructure with abundant active sites and optimized conductivity that is grown on the Nickel-foam (NF) (labeled as Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-2) is prepared using advanced magnetron sputtering strategies for electrochemical water oxidation. Based on the excellent geometric advantages and efficient charge transfer capabilities, the catalyst of Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-2 shows superior electrocatalytic activity (low overpotential) and kinetics (low electrochemical impedance) compared with nanoneedle shaped Cu2O-NiCo2O4/NF-1 and NiCo2O4/NF for OER in alkaline medium. This work demonstrates a practical and economical strategy toward the fabrication of ternary transition metal oxides for water oxidation.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Conceptual and Functional Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering8060116</link>

                Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. The proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits, such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of the layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half-reaction (known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) and cathodic half-reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current study aims to present these parameters and discuss their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalysts and minimize catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative noble metals that could be used as electrocatalysts in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Performance and Kinetic Behavior of Anion&#8208;Intercalated Borate&#8208;Based NiFe LDH in Alkaline OER</title>

                Abstract The synthesis of hydrogen via water electrolysis is an important step towards resolving the energy crisis and impeding global warming, as hydrogen can be used as a green energy carrier. The oxygen evolution as one half&#8208;cell reaction (OER) is currently limiting efficient water splitting due to kinetic inhibition as well as a complex mechanism, causing a large overpotential. Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxides (LDH) were found to be suitable OER catalysts, as they are cost effective, stable and highly active. This work focuses on the intercalation of different organic and inorganic borates into the LDH interlayers to study their influence on OER. Besides activity and stability measurements, three borate candidates were chosen for a kinetic study, including steady&#8208;state Tafel analysis and reaction order plots. It was found that the Bockris pathway with the second step as rate&#8208;determining step was predominant for all three catalysts. Of all candidates, the intercalation of borate resulted in the highest performance, which was associated with a high reducibility affecting the active metal sites.</description>

                Ruthenium metal and its oxide stand out for their exceptional catalytic activity, stability in Oxygen Evolution Reactions (OER) and electrical conductivity, making them indispensable in electronics and electrocatalysis. In this study, atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to synthesize ruthenium thin films, and the subsequent annealing of deposited ruthenium films at different elevated temperatures resulted in a progressive phase transformation from ruthenium metal to ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). The films were systematically characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. XPS was carried out with both soft X-rays from a lab-based instrument and tender X-rays from the synchrotron. The different probing depths of the techniques revealed the gradual transformation of Ru to RuO2 from the top surface as the annealing temperature was increased. The water adsorption behavior of the films was also assessed using ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) at different water vapor pressures. The influence of annealing conditions on the films affinity for water and tendency for water dissociation was analyzed to seek an initial understanding of the surface chemistry relevant to electrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Oxyanion groups recently offer an innovative avenue for improving the sluggish kinetics of electrochemical reactions benefitting from their particular polyanion configurations and large electronegativity. Nevertheless, the exact structure design and deep regulating mechanism of oxyanion species remain poorly understood. Herein, a fresh architecture of the sulfate oxyanion coordinated nickel&#8208;iron nanoalloy on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT) is newly proposed to study the activity increment effect and mechanism. The SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT displays hierarchical nanostructure with robust&#8208;wrinkled surface and highly efficient active sites. Importantly, the SO 4 2&#8722; group, as a significant manipulation factor, is first evidenced to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for NiFe nanoalloy under the reductive condition, showcasing outstanding bifunctional properties toward ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as the exceptional performance in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8208;O 2 battery. Both experimental and theoretical results elucidate that, as an electron bridge, the introduction of SO 4 2&#8722; downshifts the d&#8208;band center of SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT and gives the electron transfer passageway between the H atom in OH* intermediate and the O atom in SO 4 2&#8722; group, greatly optimizing the metal&#8208;intermediate interaction with weaker bond energy. This work provides a deep insight into the activity enhancement mechanism by the sulfate oxyanion.</description>

                For green hydrogen, the exploitation of advanced electrocatalysts is crucial, and transition metal phosphides have great potential in water splitting due to their abundant reserves and optimized electronic structure. Herein, a synergistic approach involving Mn doping and phosphorization is applied to CoFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoflowers to produce a series of bifunctional catalysts Mn&#8208;doped CoFeP (Mn&#8208;CoFeP). Electrochemical evaluations demonstrate that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of Mn(10%)&#8208;CoFeP both have notable improvement in 1 M KOH, with the overpotentials of only 160 and 239 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. Comparative electrocatalytic analysis indicates that moderate Mn doping mainly contributes to improve the OER performance, while the phosphorization significantly enhances the HER activity, resulting in effective bifunctional catalysis. For overall water decomposition, a total hydrolysis electrolysis cell equipped with the Mn(10%)&#8208;CoFeP bifunctional catalyst requires only 1.64 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . Furthermore, it performs stable operation for 10 h at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 with a current maintenance rate of 83.6%. This work offers new insights into preparing effective bifunctional electrocatalysts, advancing clean energy development.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts for Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Evolution: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>

                With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising technology for green hydrogen production, although its widespread development with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art loadings is threatened by the scarcity of iridium (Ir). Homogeneous dispersion of Ir in an immiscible electro&#8208;ceramic matrix can enhance catalytic mass activity and structural stability. The study presents Ir y Sn 0.9(1&#8722; y ) Sb 0.1(1&#8722; y ) O x solid solutions produced by highly scalable flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) process as efficient anode electrocatalysts for PEMWE, containing only 0.2 mg cm &#8722;2 of Ir in the catalyst layer (CL). Intense mixing of metal vapor and large thermal gradients in the precursor&#8208;derived high&#8208;temperature flame aids stabilizing sub&#8208;nanoscale entropic mixing within self&#8208;preserved 4&#8211;6 nm particles. Detailed investigations confirm that the one&#8208;step prepared solid solution electrocatalysts exhibit up to fourfold higher activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to Ir black. The anode of a PEMWE utilizing this catalyst exhibits high performance and stability over 2000 h but with tenfold lower Ir loading than the state&#8208;of&#8208;art.</description>

                Abstract Kenneth (Ken) Sauer was a mainstay of research in photosynthesis at the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for more than 50 years. Ken will be remembered by his colleagues, and other workers in the field of photosynthesis as well, for his pioneering work that introduced the physical techniques whose application have enriched our understanding of the basic reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. His laboratory was a training ground for many students and postdocs who went on to success in the field of photosynthesis and many others. Trained as a physical chemist, he always brought that quantitative approach to research questions and used several spectroscopic methods in his research. His broad scientific interests concerned the role of manganese in oxygen evolution, electronic properties of chlorophylls, energy transport in antenna complexes, and electron transport reactions. He was also an enthusiastic teacher, an enormously successful mentor who leaves behind a legion of scientists as his abiding legacy, a lover of music and the outdoors with many interests beyond science, and a dedicated family man with a great sense of humility. In this tribute, we summarize some aspects of Ken Sauer&#8217;s life and career, illustrated with selected research achievements, and describe his approach to research and life as we perceived it, which is complemented by reminiscences of several current researchers in photosynthesis and other fields. The supporting material includes Ken Sauers&#8217;s CV and publication list, as well as a list of the graduate students and postdocs he trained and of researchers that spent a sabbatical in his lab.</description>

                Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.</description>

      <title>Controlled Synthesis of 2D Nanostructured Bimetallic Oxide (NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Foam for Boosted Electrocatalytic Seawater Oxidation Performance</title>

                The design and development of effective electrocatalysts containing nonprecious materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater splitting remains a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale industrial hydrogen production. Nonprecious bimetallic oxide&#8208;constructed catalysts are utmost promising candidates to obtain boosting electrochemical water oxidation performance. Herein, a transition bimetallic oxide nanostructure electrocatalyst as NiMoO 4 vertically standing nanosheet over the nickel foam substrate (NiMoO 4 /NF) for electrochemical water oxidation process in alkaline fresh/simulated seawater conditions is presented. NiMoO 4 nanostructure on NF substrate is successfully obtained using a straightforward hydrothermal reaction route and thermal annealing processes. The surface morphology with elemental characteristics of the resultant NiMoO 4 /NF sample exposes highly homogenous vertical standing nanosheets assembled on the NF surface. The electrochemical water oxidation performance of the as&#8208;prepared electrodes demonstrates the function of diverse hydrothermal reaction times (3, 6, and 9 h) in fresh and simulated seawater electrolyte conditions. In alkaline seawater electrolyte conditions, optimal hydrothermal reaction time&#8208;assisted NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h electrocatalyst possesses significant OER electrocatalytic actives compared to the other samples. Similarly, NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 429 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm &#8722;2 with a Tafel slope value of 122 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER process. As a result, the resultant superior electrocatalytic performance of the optimal hydrothermal reaction time&#8208;aided electrocatalyst (NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h) is ascribed to highly accessible catalytic active centers and enhanced charge transfer kinetics at the interface for electrochemical reactions. Thus, proposed nanostructure&#8208;constructed electrocatalysts could prove to be prospective OER candidates for electrochemical water oxidation.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Oxygenic Origins of Thylakoids</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.07081</link>
      <description>Luc Cornet, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404391957

                Recent studies have shed light on the emergence and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. It is likely that the ancestor of Terrabacteria already possessed two distinct reaction centers, and that the ability to split water via photosystem II arose early in their evolution. Consequently, it is equally probable that the emergence of thylakoid membranes played a crucial role in the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, the study of thylakoid emergence remains less explored than the origin of photosystems. With a highly synchronized process involving numerous assembly factors, the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes suggests the existence of intermediate evolutionary states in the emergence of these compartments. Constrained by the sulfide-rich environment of the Archean, I propose a non-oxygenic origin of thylakoid membranes, which would have been initially devoted to alternative electron flows.</description>

                Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</description>

      <title>COMET: monitoring mitochondrial shock in anesthesiology and intensive care medicine</title>

                Abstract Mitochondria, as the cellular end-users of oxygen and responsible for approximately 98% of total body oxygen consumption, play a significant role in the development of organ dysfunction during shock. Therefore, integrating information on mitochondrial oxygen homeostasis with macroscopic observations of macrocirculation and microcirculation is crucial for monitoring critically ill patients or those undergoing high-risk surgery. However, current clinical practice still lack reliable surrogate parameters for assessing mitochondrial function. The Cellular Oxygen METabolism (COMET) monitor, utilizing the protoporphyrin IX triplet state lifetime technique (PpIX-TSLT), represents the first clinical device capable of non-invasive, in vivo measurement of mitochondrial oxygen pressure and oxidative phosphorylation. Recent research suggests that implementing this real-time bedside monitoring will provide additional insights into microcirculatory dynamics and enhance patient management. This review will comprehensively detail the rationale, methodologies, evolution, and clinical applications of the technique, aiming at improving the understanding of mitochondrial pathology in daily clinical practice and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Oxidative Extraction of Methanol from Lignin Using a Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphite Anode</title>

                Abstract This paper reports an electrochemical approach that uses lignin as a resource for renewable and sustainable methanol production. The aromatic rings of lignin have methoxy substituents, which can be oxidatively demethylated to methanol by active oxygen produced at the anode. A graphite electrode fabricated in a sponge form provided sufficient reaction space for the lignin feedstock, efficiently generated active oxygen species from water, and considerably suppressed the overoxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide. As a result, the methanol yield reached approximately 70 % at a temperature of 75 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure, and anode potential of +0.57 V. Another advantage of this technique is that hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurred at the cathode and the cathode potential was held at approximately &#8722;0.5 V during the HER. Therefore, the cell voltage required for lignin electrolysis was 1.1 V or lower, which means that hydrogen as well as methanol was produced under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Cerium Dioxide&#8208;Induced Abundant Cu+/Cu0 Sites for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to C2+ Products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402097</link>

                In recent years, the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) has made many advances in C2+ production. Cu+/Cu0 site is beneficial for C&#8208;C coupling process, but the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained during the reaction process, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity. Based on this consideration, in this work, transition metal oxide CeO2 with a hollow cube structure and oxygen vacancies was introduced to stabilize and increase Cu+/Cu0 active sites (Ce1Cu2). The catalyst exhibits excellent CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ achieving 73.52% and jC2+ &gt; 280 mA/cm2 at 1.26 V (vs. RHE). Ethanol is the main C2+ product and FEethanol reaches 39% at 1.26 V. The experimental results indicate that the presence of CeO2 provides a large number of oxygen vacancies and forming Cu+&#8208;O2&#8208;&#8208;Ce4+ structure by the strong interaction of CeO2 and Cu NPs. The structure of Cu+&#8208;O2&#8208;&#8208;Ce4+ and abundant oxygen vacancies lay a good foundation for the CO2 adsorption. Moreover, it increases the content of Cu+/Cu0 sites, effectively inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction, promoting the C&#8208;C coupling interaction, thereby facilitating the generation of C2+ products. The DFT theoretical calculation further demonstrates that Ce1Cu2 is more inclined towards the ethanol pathway, confirming its high selectivity for ethanol.</description>

      <title>From Micro-Environments to Macroscopic Effects: How the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Drives Cu Cathodic Corrosion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-d6hl7</link>

                Cathodic corrosion of copper (Cu) has posed a significant challenge for over a century, impeding various technological progresses such as electrochemical conversion of CO2 (eCO2RR) into fuels and other value-added carbon products. In this study, employing a combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation approach, we delve into the atomistic level mechanism driving this phenomenon in Cu. Our hypothesis posits the pivotal role of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in facilitating cathodic corrosion in Cu. We rigorously develop a pH-dependent hydroxide (OH) adsorption mechanism and calculate the equilibrium OH coverage (&#120579;OH) at varying pH levels, the thermodynamic stability of subsurface oxygen (Osub), as well as the Cu-vacancy mediated diffusion of subsurface oxygens (Osub). Through comprehensive analysis, we establish correlation among various microenvironments, including oxygen diffusion in subsurface layers, pH-dependent OH adsorption, and Cu dissolution into the electrolyte as (Cu- OH) complexes. Furthermore, our investigation explores the correlation between surface coordination environment of active sites and cathodic corrosion of Cu. Finally, by integrating DFT- derived thermodynamic data into a kMC model, we successfully predict the formation of experimentally observed corrosion pits on Cu-surfaces. This combined approach not only advances our fundamental understanding of Cu cathodic corrosion but also offers insights crucial for developing effective corrosion mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>A phenotype-structured mathematical model for the influence of hypoxia
  on oncolytic virotherapy</title>

                The effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is significantly affected by several elements of the tumour microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the influence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.</description>

                The disproportionate expansion of telencephalic structures during human evolution involved tradeoffs that imposed greater connectivity and metabolic demands on midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Despite the central role of dopaminergic neurons in human-enriched disorders, molecular specializations associated with human-specific features and vulnerabilities of the dopaminergic system remain unexplored. Here, we establish a phylogeny-in-a-dish approach to examine gene regulatory evolution by differentiating pools of human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque pluripotent stem cells into ventral midbrain organoids capable of forming long-range projections, spontaneous activity, and dopamine release. We identify human-specific gene expression changes related to axonal transport of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species buffering and candidate cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression divergence. Our findings are consistent with a model of evolved neuroprotection in response to tradeoffs related to brain expansion and could contribute to the discovery of therapeutic targets and strategies for treating disorders involving the dopaminergic system.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pore formation and carburizing mechanism of magnetite reduction by CO</title>

                To investigate the porosity and expansion mechanism of CO-reduced magnetite, the reduced microstructures of magnetite under conventional heating and microwave heating were compared. The microstructure characteristics of magnetite with various reduction degrees were examined in a 60%CO-Ar reduction atmosphere, and the formation and evolution mechanism of the structure were analyzed in conjunction with the reduction effect. The results indicate that the reduction product of CO reduced magnetite possesses a porous structure. Nevertheless, when the gas diffusion is restricted, the reduction process is sluggish and the porous structure is not readily formed. Microwave heating enhances the gas-phase diffusion capacity, thermodynamic carburizing capacity, and solid-phase carbon-oxygen diffusion capacity, resulting in a higher oxygen loss rate than that of conventional heating. Under the experimental conditions, the lattice shrinkage during the Fe 3 O 4 &#8594; Fe 0.88 O transformation and the rapid expansion of Fe 0.88 O &#8594; Fe 0.94 O are the causes of the crack.

                In order to investigate the internal mechanism and the variation law of capacity attenuation of LIBs, a simplified electrochemical model of the LIBs was established using the nickel-cobalt-aluminum LIBs as the research object, and the aging model of solid electrolyte interface SEI growth and lithium evolution was added to simulate the electrochemical behavior of the batteries. The results showed that the porosity of the anode/diaphragm reduced continually at the start of the cycle, while the SEI film grew continuously. The loss of active materials accelerated as the number of cycles increased, while the side reaction of lithium development continued. Finally, the aging mechanism was confirmed by using microscopic morphology. The results show that the negative particles are obviously crushed and contain white deposited substances. The formation of these compounds increases the oxygen content, reduces the carbon content, reduces the porosity of the electrode, increases the overpotential of the electrolyte transport, and becomes the main reason for the attenuation of the battery life. Finally, the positive particles expand and break, which leads to the sudden reduction of the battery capacity. This study determined the evolution process of aging mechanism in the whole life cycle, and provided a theoretical basis for the establishment of mechanism aging model.</description>

      <title>Tracking Depositional Architecture and Diagenetic Evolution in the Jurassic Carbonates, Trans Indus Ranges, NW Himalayas</title>

                The evolution of Jurassic carbonates is globally significant for understanding the depositional framework, diagenetic phases and sedimentary characteristics of shallow marine shelf deposits. For this purpose, two outcrop sections of the Jurassic carbonates with a road distance of 121 km in the Trans Indus Ranges, NW Himalayas, were included in this study. Geological fieldwork was conducted for sedimentological data, and representative samples were collected for microfacies analysis and diagenetic evolution complemented by carbon and oxygen isotope analysis. Results show that eight microfacies were identified in both sections where mudstone microfacies was only present in the Chichali section, whereas wackestone and packstone facies widely existed in both sections. The diagenetic evolution interpreted that dolomitization and stylolization were pronounced in the Paniala section, while micritization and calcite cementation were prevalent in the Chichali section. The interpreted depositional setting implies the wide range from supratidal to outer ramp shallow marine for the Chichali section, suggesting a wide range and relatively deeper environment, alongside merely intertidal to middle ramp settings for Paniala section. Diagenetic evolution suggests marine to meteoric influence in the Chichali section, while burial and uplift phases were dominant in the Paniala section. The diagenetic events were also validated by the isotopic analysis, where most of the samples with values up to &#8722;4&#8240; VPDB &#948;18O, corresponding to a carbon isotope range of up to +4&#8240;, were interpreted as the burial phase of diagenesis; meanwhile, a few samples with &#8722;2 &#948;13C and &#8722;7&#8240; VPDB &#948;18O isotope signatures were marked as meteoric influx in the Paniala section. This study indicates the diversity of the depositional environment and diagenetic heterogeneity by integration of thin sections using isotope data, which are quite applicable to shallow marine carbonates.</description>

                Abstract Reconsideration of the stratigraphy of the Dharwars of Mysore State in the light of new data suggests that they are Paleoproterozoic and overlie Charnockites of Archean age. Classification of Dharwars based on tectonomagmatic and atmospheric evolution leads to a four fold divison. Pregeosynclinal shelf stage iS represented by two cycles of platformal sedimentation and magmatism; the earlier, under oxygen deficient conditions, on mafic platforms built by subaerial lavas, Is represented by Bababudan Series, and the latter under oxygenic conditions accompained by alkaline ultramafic intrusions gave rise to Dodguni Series. The geosynclinal Stage represented by pillow-Iava-greywacke-Iron ore deposition (third cycle of magmatism and sedimentation) constitutes the Grey trapRambennur Series. Early tectonic plagioclase granites-Champion gneisses syntectonic migmatites-Peninsular gneisses and late to post-tectonic alkali metasomatic granites Closepet granites (fourth, fifth and sixth magmatic cycles) developed during the folding and metamorphism of Dharwar geosynclinal pile. The inversion of geosyncline witnessed apogeosynclinal molasse red bed Sedimentation (fourth cycle of sedimentation) represented by G. R. Series. Paleoproterozoic epidiorites and post-Paleoproterozoic dolerites cratonised the area.</description>

                The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Introduction of cytosine-5 DNA methylation sensitizes cells to oxidative damage</title>

                DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5mC) is an ancient epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli . We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli . Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC. Oxidative stress is frequently encountered by organisms in their environment, thus offering a plausible reason for total loss of 5mC in some species.</description>

                Life on Earth is more than 3.5 billion years old nearly as old as the age of the planet. Over this vast expanse of time, life and its biomolecules adapted to and triggered profound changes to the Earth s environment. Certain critical enzymes evolved early in the history of life and have persisted through planetary extremes. While sequence data is widely used to trace evolutionary trajectories, enzyme structure remains an underexplored resource for understanding how proteins evolve over long timescales. Here, we implement an integrated approach to study nitrogenase, an ancient, globally critical enzyme essential for nitrogen fixation. Despite the ecological diversity of its host microbes, nitrogenase has strict functional limitations, including extreme oxygen sensitivity, energy requirements and substrate availability. By combining phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, protein crystallography and deep learning based structural prediction, we resurrected three billion years of nitrogenase structural history. We present the first effort to predict all extant and ancestral structures along the evolutionary tree of an enzyme and present a total of 5000 structures. Our approach lays the foundation for reconstructing key structural constraints that influence protein evolution and studying ancient enzyme evolution in the light of phylogenetic and environmental change.</description>

      <title>Towards The Upscaling Of ODS Steels: STARS ROUTE&#174;</title>

                14Cr-2W-0.3Ti-0.3Y2O3 Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) Ferritic Stainless Steels are promising candidates for structural components in future nuclear systems. Their outstanding properties are attributed to an ultrafine microstructure and a very stable dispersion of Y-Ti-O oxide nanoparticles (NPs).The STARS Route&#174; developed to produce ODS alloys avoids the need for mechanical alloying to dissolve the oxide-former elements in the matrix and relies on Ceit&#8217;s capability to introduce them during gas atomization as oversaturated solid solution. Warm rolling after HIPing introduces a high density of dislocations, preferential nucleation sites. Final annealing heat treatment precipitates the NPs through an internal oxidation process: the metastable oxides formed at the surface of powder particles after atomization dissociate, and oxygen, Ti and Y diffuse towards the dislocations, where they precipitate as Y-Ti-O nano-oxides.This work shows the microstructural evolution of ODS steels obtained with the STARS Route&#174;, and the role of process parameters on mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Type Ib/c Origin of the Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8</title>

                Abstract Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars (&#8819;10 M &#8857; ) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 had experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N vii Ly &#945; line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O = 0.5 &#177; 0.1) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss and ended up as a Wolf&#8211;Rayet star exposing the He-burning layer at the presupernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong enough mass-loss to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.</description>

      <title>Thermal Protection and Dielectric Properties of Borosilicate Coatings for SiCf/SiC Composites Under High-Temperature Oxidation</title>

                Currently, oxidation of SiCf/SiC composites in harsh environments such as high temperatures has become a key challenge for their application in high-temperature structural wave-absorbing materials. In this study, borosilicate glass (BSZ) coatings were prepared using the thermal nitrogen&#8211;oxygen process. The evolution of mechanical and coating microwave dielectric properties of the composites with and without BSZ coatings after oxidation at 1100 &#176;C, 1200 &#176;C, 1300 &#176;C and 1400 &#176;C was investigated. The results showed that the mechanical strength of the BSZ-coated SiCf/SiC specimens remains virtually unchanged, with a remarkable strength retention rate of 94%. The exceptional oxidation resistance of these coatings can be attributed to the formation of self-healing oxides and the reinforcing &#8220;pinning&#8221; effect of ZrSiO4. With an increase in oxidation temperature, the dielectric properties of the oxidized coatings are determined by the intrinsic properties of the generators and the porosity. Overall, these features highlight the potential of borosilicate coatings in the field of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composites, and the current work establishes a correlation between the oxidized microscopic properties of the coatings and the dielectric properties.</description>

                Context. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early Galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. Aims. This work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= -1.79 dex. Our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted level of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.</description>

                We determine the spectroscopic properties of ~1000 ostensibly star-forming galaxies at redshifts (z=4-10) using prism spectroscopy from JWST/NIRSpec. With rest-wavelength coverage between Lya and [S II] in the optical, we stack spectra as a function of nebular conditions, and compare UV spectral properties with stellar age. This reveals UV lines of N III], N IV], C III], C IV, He II, and O III] in the average high-z galaxy. All UV lines are more intense in younger starbursts. We measure electron temperatures from the collisionally excited [O III] line ratios, finding Te=18000-22000 K for the O++ regions. We also detect a significant nebular Balmer Jump from which we estimate only Te=8000-13000 K. Accounting for typical temperature offsets between zones bearing doubly and singly ionized oxygen, these two temperatures remain discrepant by around 40%. We use the [O III] temperatures to estimate abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We find that log(C/O) is consistently ~-1, with no evolution of C/O with metallicity or stellar age. The average spectra are mildly enhanced in Nitrogen, with higher N/O than low-z starbursts, but are less enhanced than samples of high-z galaxies with visible UV N III] and N IV]. Whatever processes produce the N-enhancement in the individual galaxies must also be ongoing, at lower levels, in the median galaxy in the early Universe. The strongest starbursts are a source of significant ionizing emission: ionizing photon production efficiencies reach 10^25.7 Hz/erg, and show multiple signatures of high Lyman continuum escape, including Mg II escape fractions nearing 100%, significant deficits in [S II] emission, high degrees of ionization, and blue UV colors.</description>

      <title>Supersensitive seismic magnetometry on white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.20557</link>

                The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs: $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$-$10\,\mathrm{kG}$, although they can reach down to $\sim10$-$100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.</description>

      <title>Genomic Insights into Tibetan Sheep Adaptation to Different Altitude Environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252212394</link>
      <description>Wentao Zhang, Chao Yuan, Xuejiao An, Tingting Guo, Caihong Wei, Zengkui Lu, Jianbin Liu, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 25(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404504755

                In recent years, research has gradually uncovered the mechanisms of animal adaptation to hypoxic conditions in different altitude environments, particularly at the genomic level. However, past genomic studies on high-altitude adaptation have often not delved deeply into the differences between varying altitude levels. This study conducted whole-genome sequencing on 60 Tibetan sheep (Medium Altitude Group (MA): 20 Tao sheep (TS) at 2887 m, High Altitude Group (HA): 20 OuLa sheep (OL) at 3501 m, and Ultra-High Altitude Group (UA): 20 AWang sheep (AW) at 4643 m) from different regions of the Tibetan Plateau in China to assess their responses under varying conditions. Population genetic structure analysis revealed that the three groups are genetically independent, but the TS and OL groups have experienced gene flow with other northern Chinese sheep due to geographical factors. Selection signal analysis identified FGF10, MMP14, SLC25A51, NDUFB8, ALAS1, PRMT1, PRMT5, and HIF1AN as genes associated with ultra-high-altitude hypoxia adaptation, while HMOX2, SEMA4G, SLC16A2, SLC22A17, and BCL2L2 were linked to high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. Functional analysis showed that ultra-high-altitude adaptation genes tend to influence physiological mechanisms directly affecting oxygen uptake, such as lung development, angiogenesis, and red blood cell formation. In contrast, high-altitude adaptation genes are more inclined to regulate mitochondrial DNA replication, iron homeostasis, and calcium signaling pathways to maintain cellular function. Additionally, the functions of shared genes further support the adaptive capacity of Tibetan sheep across a broad geographic range, indicating that these genes offer significant selective advantages in coping with oxygen scarcity. In summary, this study not only reveals the genetic basis of Tibetan sheep adaptation to different altitudinal conditions but also highlights the differences in gene regulation between ultra-high- and high-altitude adaptations. These findings offer new insights into the adaptive evolution of animals in extreme environments and provide a reference for exploring adaptation mechanisms in other species under hypoxic conditions.</description>

      <title>High&#8208;Throughput UV&#8208;Induced Synthesis and Screening of Alloy Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202406848</link>

                Abstract The combination of different elements in alloy catalysts can lead to improved activity as it provides opportunities to tune the electronic structures of surface atoms. However, the synthesis and performance screening of alloy catalysts through a vast chemical space are cost&#8208; and labor&#8208;intensive. Herein, a UV&#8208;induced, high&#8208;throughput method is reported for the synthesis and screening of alloy electrocatalysts in a fast and low&#8208;cost manner. A platform that integrates 37 mini&#8208;reaction&#8208;cells enables simultaneous UV&#8208;induced photodeposition of alloy nanoparticles with up to 37 compositions. These mini&#8208;reaction&#8208;cells further allow a transfer&#8208;free, high&#8208;throughput electrochemical performance screening. Binary (PtPd, PtIr, PdIr), ternary (PtPdIr, PtRuIr) and quaternary (PtPdRuIr) alloys have been synthesized with the activity of the binary alloys (57 compositions) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) being screened. The predicted high performance of identified alloy compositions are subsequently validated by standard measurements using a rotating disk electrode configuration. It is found that the as&#8208;synthesized alloy nanoparticles are rich in twin boundaries and thus possess lattice strain. Density functional theory calculation implies that the high ORR activity of the screened Pt 0.75 Pd 0.25 alloy originates from the interplay between the differentiated adsorption sites because of alloying and the strain&#8208;induced modulation of the d&#8208;band center.</description>

      <title>Versatile Organometallic Synthesis of 0D/2D Metal@Germanane Nanoarchitectonics for Electrochemical Energy Conversion Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202400854</link>

                Abstract Hydrogen&#8208;terminated 2D&#8211;Germanane (2D&#8211;GeH), a germanium&#8208;based 2D material akin to graphene, is receiving enormous attention owing to its predicted optoelectronic characteristics. However, experimental research of 2D&#8211;GeH is still in an early stage, and therefore its real implementation for task&#8208;specific applications will depend on the correct development of suitable chemical functionalization methods. Herein, a general and straightforward organometallic (OM) approach is provided for the robust functionalization of 2D&#8211;GeH with different 0D noble metal nanoparticles (M&#8211;NPs), resulting in 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, 0D/2D Pt@GeH and Au@GeH nanoarchitectonics have been successfully synthesized, characterized, and explored as unconventional electrocatalysts for boosting energy conversion reactions. While the hydrogen evolution reaction activity was evaluated for Pt@GeH, the oxygen reduction reaction was interrogated for Au@GeH. Interestingly, the implanted catalytic features of M&#8211;NPs yielded to 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics with enhanced energy conversion activity comparing to pristine 2D&#8211;GeH counterpart. This work proves the suitability of 2D&#8211;GeH as unconventional substrates to stabilize nobleM&#8722;NPs, and the versatility of the OM approach for the custom design of a new family of 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics to expand the implementation of monoelemental 2D materials as promising electrocatalysts in energy conversion field and beyond.</description>

                Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common pathway to End-stage renal disease (ESRD). Podocytes are crucial due to their dual barrier functions in kidney diseases. Their role in renal fibrosis and DKD regulatory mechanisms is increasingly studied. However, bibliometric research in this field has not been explored. Methods 1,250 publications from Jan. 1, 2000, to Feb. 16, 2024, were retrieved from the WoSCC database and analyzed by the Web of Science results analysis tool, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Results Our scrutiny reveals that authors Liu Youhua, Fogo Agnes B, and Zhao Yingyong have made substantial contributions to this domain. Notably, &#8220;Kidney International&#8221; has the highest volume of publications in this area. Furthermore, our analysis identifies ten co-citation clusters: DKD, IncRNA, reactive oxygen species, glomerulosclerosis, Poria cocos, glomerular diseases, fibroblasts, connective tissue growth factor, coagulation, and Wnt. Recent research accentuates keywords such as autophagy, TRPC6, ERS, epigenetics, and NLRP3 inflammasome as frequently occurring terms in this field. The prevailing research hotspot keywords include autophagy, biomarker, and exosomes. Conclusion Through the utilization of bibliometric tools and knowledge graph analysis, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of the intricate nexus between podocytes in DKD and renal fibrosis. This study imparts valuable insights to scholars regarding the dynamic evolution of this association and delineates prospective research avenues in this pivotal realm.</description>

      <title>Geochemistry of Granite-Greenstone Terrain of South India</title>

      <description>B. Sreenivas, R. Srinivasan, Journal of the Geological Society of India. 15(4)] 1974. https://openalex.org/W4404504862

                Abstract A critical evaluation of the available major and trace element data on rocks of the granite-greenstone belts or South India leads to the following inferences: Barrovian and Abukuma facies series of metamorphism are recognizable in the terrain. Rocks of peridotitic and basaltic komatiite affinities occur in the pre-Dharwar and early Dharwar ultramafic-mafic sequence. The bulk of the greenstones are island arc tholeiites with a strong calc-alkaline affinity. The presence of detrital pyrites in the oldest conglomerates, and the occurrence of red beds in the topmost Dharwar sequence, indicate that an oxygenic atmosphere evolved through the Dharwar times. The pre-Dharwar granitoids were probably tonalitic, and through time, alkali fractionation gave rise to the Champion gneisses, Peninsular gneisses and Closepet granites. The available data are inadequate to elucidate the fractionation pattern of the granitic crust of Peninsular India. Pyrolite and eclogite mantle are invoked for tectonomagmatic events during the pre-Dharwar and Dharwar times, respectively. Convection, and eclogite sinkers, are proposed as alternative geodynamic models. From the geochemical evolution, it is contended that the granite-greenstone belts of Peninsular India represent a more evolved crustal condition as compared to the Archaean granite greenstone belts of South Africa and Western Australia. Obviously, the granite-greenstone belts of all the shield areas, did not evolve simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Geochemistry of Precambrian Carbonatite Complexes of India: Present Status of, and Gaps in our Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.17491/jgsi/1974/150411</link>
      <description>G.R. Udas, Journal of the Geological Society of India. 15(4)] 1974. https://openalex.org/W4404504933

                Abstract Carbonatites of Precambrian age occur at Newania and Mundwara in Rajasthan, Sevathur and Hogenakal in Tamil Nadu, Kunavaram in Andhra Pradesh, and KolJegal in Karnataka. The Newania carbonatite is 959&#177;24 m.y. old (K-Ar age of an alkali amphibole), and the Sevathur carbonatite is 720&#177;30 m.y. old (K-Ar age of a biotite). Although comprehensive geochemical studies involving major, minor, and trace elements and carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopes have been undertaken on the 37.5&#177;2.5 m.y. old Eocene carbonatite complex at Amba Dongar, Gujarat, geochemical studies on the Precambrian carbonatites of India have been confined only to routine determinations of selected elements like Sr, Ba, Y, Ce, La, Nb, Zr, Th, Mn, Ti, F and P to demonstrate their carbonatitic affinites. Except for two K-Ar ages, and for some limited trace element data, no attempts have been made to elucidate the chronologie and petrogenetic evolution of these Precambrian carbonatites by the application of Rb-Sr, K-Ar, and U-Pb geochronometry, critical element ratios, stable and radiogenic isotope abundances, and geothermometry. Basic researches aimed at formulating geochemical criteria for locating commercially exploitable economic Precambrian carbonatite complexes are yet to be initiated in India.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the marine iodine cycle and its relationship to ocean deoxygenation in an Earth system model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4927-2024</link>
      <description>Keyi Cheng, Andy Ridgwell, Dalton Hardisty, Biogeosciences. 21(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404326688

                Abstract. Iodine (I) abundance in marine carbonates (measured as an elemental ratio with calcium, I / Ca) is of broad interest as a proxy for local/regional ocean redox. This connection arises because the speciation of iodine in seawater, the balance between iodate (IO3-) and iodide (I&#8722;), is sensitive to the prevalence of oxic vs. anoxic conditions. However, although I / Ca ratios are increasingly commonly being measured in ancient carbonate samples, a fully quantitative interpretation of this proxy requires the availability of a mechanistic interpretative framework for the marine iodine cycle that can account for the extent and intensity of ocean deoxygenation in the past. Here we present and evaluate a representation of marine iodine cycling embedded in an Earth system model (&#8220;cGENIE&#8221;) against both modern and paleo-observations. In this framework, we account for IO3- uptake and release of I&#8722; through the biological pump, the reduction in ambient IO3- to I&#8722; in the water column, and the re-oxidation of I&#8722; to IO3-. We develop and test a variety of different plausible mechanisms for iodine reduction and oxidation transformation and contrast model projections against an updated compilation of observed dissolved IO3- and I&#8722; concentrations in the present-day ocean. By optimizing the parameters controlling previously proposed mechanisms involved in marine iodine cycling, we find that we can obtain broad matches to observed iodine speciation gradients in zonal surface distribution, depth profiles, and oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs). However, we also identify alternative, equally well performing mechanisms which assume a more explicit mechanistic link between iodine transformation and environment &#8211; an ambiguity that highlights the need for more process-based studies on modern marine iodine cycling. Finally, to help distinguish between competing representations of the marine iodine cycle and because our ultimate motivation is to further our ability to reconstruct ocean oxygenation in the geological past, we conducted &#8220;plausibility tests&#8221; of different model schemes against available I / Ca measurements made on Cretaceous carbonates &#8211; a time of substantially depleted ocean oxygen availability compared to modern and hence a strong test of our model. Overall, the simultaneous broad match we can achieve between modeled iodine speciation and modern observations, and between forward proxy modeled I / Ca and geological elemental ratios, supports the application of our Earth system modeling in simulating the marine iodine cycle to help interpret and constrain the redox evolution of past oceans.</description>

      <title>Swimming kinematics of deep&#8208;sea fishes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15989</link>
      <description>Brett H. Woodworth, Jessica Palmeri, Patrick Flannery, Lydia Fregosi, Cassandra M. Donatelli, Mackenzie E. Gerringer, Journal of Fish Biology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404512811

                Abstract Although the deep oceans represent Earth's largest habitat, the challenges of studying deep&#8208;sea organisms in situ have limited our understanding of adaptation, ecology, and behaviour in these important ecosystems. One fundamental trait of fishes that remains largely unexplored in the deep ocean is swimming, a vital process for movement, migration, and dispersal in marine habitats. Deep&#8208;sea conditions such as temperature, pressure, and food availability could each impact the speed and efficiency of swimming in fishes. To investigate swimming kinematics of fishes with increasing depth, we analysed in situ video of bony fishes across a 6000&#8208;m depth gradient. We compared open&#8208;source videos of fishes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean Exploration with tank&#8208;based recordings of shallow&#8208;water relatives from Puget Sound, Washington, USA to understand how both habitat depth and phylogeny influence swimming in fishes. We analysed kinematics in four dominant demersal fish groups, the orders Anguilliformes, Gadiformes, Ophidiiformes, and Perciformes. Deep&#8208;sea fishes swam consistently slowly. Swimming kinematics varied across temperature, oxygen, body elongation, and depth. These results suggest that swimming kinematics do not change linearly with increasing habitat depth in fishes and that the impacts of deep&#8208;sea conditions such as low temperatures, high pressures, and low nutrient availability on swimming behaviour need to be considered independently of one another. These findings provide insight into the evolution of fish form and function in the deep ocean.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): II.
  Freshly Sublimated Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the Keplerian Disk</title>

      <description>Jae-Hong Jeong, Jeong&#8208;Eun Lee, Seonjae Lee, Giseon Baek, Ji&#8211;Hyun Kang, Seokho Lee, Chul-Hwan Kim, Hyeong-Sik Yun, Yuri Aikawa, Gregory J. Herczeg, Doug Johnstone, Lucas Cieza, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404368497

                We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Five Natural Magnetite Reference Materials for &lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Iron Isotope Measurement with Application to Magmatic Ni&#8208;Cu Sulfide Mineralisation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/ggr.12592</link>

                Iron isotope ratios in magnetite have been widely used to reveal critical geological and biological processes. Laser ablation multi&#8208;collector inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry (LA&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS) is ideally suited for measurement of Fe isotope ratios, however the lack of suitable reference materials poses a significant challenge for in situ Fe isotopic measurements in magnetites. In this study, five high&#8208;quality natural magnetite crystals were characterised for Fe isotope ratios using solution nebulisation (SN)&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS and LA&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS. The effects of LA&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS analytical conditions were investigated to obtain precise and accurate Fe isotope ratios. The yielded intermediate measurement precisions for the &#948; 56 Fe values in the five investigated magnetites were &#177; 0.05&#8211;0.06&#8240; (2 s ) using SN&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS and &#177; 0.08&#8211;0.14&#8240; (2 s ) using LA&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS. Magnetites with homogeneous Fe isotopic compositions in hand&#8208;specimen measurements and microanalysis can serve as potential reference materials for in situ Fe isotopic measurement. Furthermore, the Fe isotope ratios in the magnetites from the Jinchuan Ni&#8208;Cu&#8208;PGE sulfide deposit were measured using LA&#8208;MC&#8208;ICP&#8208;MS with natural magnetite as the bracketing calibrator. The increase in the Fe isotopic composition with magmatic sulfide evolution was primarily dominated by oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) and hydrothermal fluids. This finding implies that the Fe isotopic composition of magnetite can serve as a potential geochemical indicator of magmatic Ni&#8208;Cu sulfide mineralisation.</description>

                Abstract The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon&#8211;oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB&#8217;s observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state, with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, t col . We include a nonzero angular momentum of the NSs and find that t col ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about 5 minute orbital period), promptly form a BH, and release &#8819;10 52 erg of energy. They form NS&#8211;BH binaries with tens of kiloyears merger timescales by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, and release &#8764;10 50 &#8211;10 52 erg and &#8818;10 50 erg of energy, respectively. They form NS&#8211;NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS&#8211;BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a nonrotating NS. Magnetic braking by a 10 13 G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH&#8211;BH or NS&#8211;BH with tens of kiloyears merger timescales.</description>

      <title>Spatio-chemical deconvolution of the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li6PS5Cl interphase layer in all-solid-state batteries using combined X-ray spectroscopic methods</title>

                The (electro-)chemical degradation at the interface between Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) is systematically investigated using non-destructive synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM). These techniques provide surface chemical depth profiling (from 2 nm to several hundred nm) and high-resolution elemental imaging of both LPSC and NCM622 particles. This analysis was complemented by galvanostatic cycling, impedance spectroscopy, and operando cell pressure measurements. Several correlations between interphase evolution and cell electrochemical performance are clarified, while some inconsistencies are rationalized and discussed. Firstly, the intrinsic LPSC electrochemical oxidation mechanisms were studied using an LPSC:C65 working electrode. The results showed that increased cell resistance during the first charge stemmed from polysulfide by-products and particle contact loss due to LPSC volume shrinkage at the interface. Secondly, when using an NCM622:LPSC working electrode, species such as sulfites, sulfates and phosphates, were detected on both LPSC and NCM622 particles, while electrochemically inactive reduced transition metals (TMs) were observed only at NCM622 surfaces. These species, initially present at open circuit potential, increased after the first charge, due to the chemical reactions between LPSC and NCM622 surface lattice oxygen. The estimated interphase thickness on the LPSC and NCM622 surface over the cycling remains below &#8275;3 nm. Our findings highlight that the formation of an electrochemically inactive NCM622 surface is a primary cause of impedance rise during the first charge, along with the formation of LPSC by-products and contact loss. However, the continuous increase in cell resistance could not be attributed to further interphase growth after the first charge. We hypothesize that this may result from slow and progressive LPSC polymerization reactions (e.g., form Li2PS6 and P2S5) and structural changes at the NCM622 surface.</description>

      <title>Sulfur-bearing molecules in a sample of early star-forming cores</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.00539</link>
      <description>N. C. Martinez, S. Par&#243;n, M. E. Ortega, A. Petriella, A. Guti&#233;rrez del &#193;lamo, Michael A. Brook, C. Carballo, T. Heberling, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404345238

                The sulfur content in dense molecular regions of the interstellar medium is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason of this phenomenon is unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages to uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense cores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and column densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum emission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The abundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas temperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to 100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly correlated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar chemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with oxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores. This work gives quantitative information about abundances that could be useful in chemical models pointing to explain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec WIDE survey: a z=4.6 low-mass star-forming galaxy hosting a jet-driven shock with low ionisation and solar metallicity</title>

                Abstract We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV&#8211;optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z = 4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O+ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C+. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion of &#963; &#8764; 400 km s&#8722;1, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Diagnostics based on emission-line ratios suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M&#8902; = 1.4 &#215; 1010 M&#8857;, SFR = 70 M&#8857; yr&#8722;1), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H&#946; luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar &#8211; three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z = 4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks:
  comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>

                The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>UV-Induced DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Effects on Mutagenesis and Culturability in Escherichia coli</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.14.623584</link>

                Mutagenic processes drive evolutionary progress, with ultraviolet (UV) radiation significantly affecting evolution. Despite extensive research on SOS response-mediated mutagenesis, UV-induced repair mechanisms remain complex, and their effects on cell survival and mutagenesis are not fully understood. We previously observed a near-perfect correlation between RecA-mediated SOS response and mutation levels in Escherichia coli following UV treatment. However, prolonged UV exposure caused transient non-culturability and impaired SOS-mediated mutagenesis. Using fluorescent reporters, flow cytometry, promoter-reporter assays, single-gene deletions, knockouts, and clonogenic assays, we found that excessive UV exposure disrupts cellular translation, reducing SOS gene expression, albeit with minimal impact on membrane permeability or reactive oxygen species levels. While our findings underline the abundance of repair mechanisms in E. coli cells, enabling them to compensate when specific genes are disrupted, they also highlighted the differential impacts of gene deletions on mutagenesis versus culturability, leading to three major outcomes: (i) Disruption of proteins involved in DNA polymerase for trans-lesion synthesis (UmuC and UmuD) or Holliday junction resolution (RuvC) results in significantly decreased mutagenesis levels while maintaining a transient non-culturability pattern after UV exposure. (ii) Disruption of proteins involved in homologous recombination (RecA and RecB) and nucleotide excision repair (UvrA) leads to both significantly reduced mutagenesis and a more severe transient non-culturability pattern after UV exposure, making these cells more sensitive to UV. (iii) Disruption of DNA Helicase II (UvrD), which functions in mismatch repair, does not affect mutagenesis levels from UV radiation but results in a very pronounced transient non-culturability pattern following UV exposure. Overall, our results further advance our understanding of bacterial adaptation mechanisms and the role of DNA repair pathways in shaping mutagenesis.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum: Seasonal intensification of oxygen minimum zone: linking Godavari River discharge to fall hypoxia in the Bay of Bengal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1523183</link>
      <description>K. S. Sreejith, V. V. S. S. Sarma, P. Sreenivas, F. Feba, Ibrahim Hoteit, Karumuri Ashok, Frontiers in Marine Science. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404494464

                The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), Arabian Sea (AS), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) are recognized for hosting the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), characterized by severe hypoxia at intermediate depths (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). The formation of these OMZs is attributed to a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical processes, many of which exhibit commonalities across all three basins. Enhanced primary productivity in surface waters fosters organic matter export to deeper layers. This organic matter undergoes intensified decomposition at intermediate depths, leading to oxygen depletion through microbial respiration (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Pennington et al., 2006). Furthermore, sluggish circulation patterns within these basins limit the advection of oxygen-rich waters into the OMZ, and weak vertical mixing restricts oxygen replenishment from the surface (Breitburg et al., 2018; Gilly et al., 2013; Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; McCreary et al., 2013).The Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone (BoB-OMZ) deviates from the typical pattern observed in the ETP and AS despite sharing common drivers for OMZ formation (Gilly et al., 2013; McCreary et al., 2013). This disparity underscores the significant influence of regional factors on the BoB-OMZ's characteristics. A key distinction lies in the primary mechanism responsible for its persistence. Microbial processes such as denitrification and anammox are crucial for oxygen consumption in the ETP and AS (Rao et al., 1994; Gilly et al., 2013; Kalvelage et al., 2013; Castro-Gonz&#225;lez et al., 2014). In contrast, the BoB-OMZ primarily owes its existence to intense salinity stratification (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 2009; Sarma et al., 2018; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). This stratification effectively traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment from the surface. Cyclonic eddies further influence the intensity and distribution of the BoB-OMZ (Sarma et al., 2018). Interestingly, anticyclonic eddies can sporadically ventilate the BoB-OMZ with oxygen-rich surface waters, leading to temporary weakening and spatial heterogeneity of the hypoxic zone (Sarma and Udaya Bhaskar, 2018). These contrasting mechanisms, absent in the ETP and AS, contribute to the BoB-OMZ's weaker overall intensity and dynamic nature.The intensity and extent of the BoB-OMZ exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. In the northern BoB, influenced by major river discharge from the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, the summer monsoon and post-monsoon seasons see intensified salinity stratification, leading to a more pronounced OMZ (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021; Sarma et al., 2016). This stratification traps oxygen-depleted waters, hindering vertical mixing and oxygen replenishment. Additionally, the cross-shelf transport of organic matter from the western BoB fuels microbial decomposition, resulting in a stronger OMZ compared to the eastern region (Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021). Recent studies suggest the possibility of even more intense OMZ formation in the northwestern BoB during winter (Bristow et al., 2017), potentially due to enhanced nutrient input from rivers or atmospheric deposition. However, Sridevi and Sarma (2021) propose that these intense episodes might be transient features caused by eddies. Biogeochemically, the BoB-OMZ is considered weaker compared to other regions. This can be attributed to factors such as weak upwelling, limited primary productivity, and rapid sinking of organic carbon to the deep sea, reducing the availability of organic matter for microbial oxygen consumption (Rao et al., 1994; Ittekkot et al., 1991; Naqvi et al., 1996; Ramaiah et al., 2010; McCreary et al., 2013). Furthermore, several studies suggest that riverine nutrients are rapidly consumed within a limited distance (20 km) from the coast, restricting their contribution to offshore OMZ intensification (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2018).The Godavari River, India's third-longest fluvial system (1,465 km), is driven by the monsoon cycle, resulting in concentrated discharge from July to September (Central Water Commission, 2019). This peak discharge coincides with the BoB's highest riverine input, contrasting with the dominance of tidal processes in other seasons (Howden and Murtugudde, 2001; Sarma et al., 2010). While the influence of major rivers such as the Ganges and Brahmaputra on the northern BoB-OMZ is well-established (Jana et al., 2015; Udaya Bhaskar et al., 2021), the annual impact of medium-sized rivers such as the Godavari remains less explored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the annual cycle of Godavari River discharge (GRD), its potential effects on local coastal primary productivity, and its contribution to the development of a seasonal OMZ near the river mouth. The following section outlines the methodology and details the datasets employed. Section 3 presents our findings on the seasonal evolution of the BoB- OMZ, the biogeochemistry in the river mouth region, and the potential mechanisms driving the intense OMZs observed near the Godavari. Finally, section 4 provides a comprehensive summary and concluding remarks. The GRD data utilized in this study were obtained from the Dowleiswaram barrage, located approximately 50 km upstream of the river's confluence with the BoB. This barrage serves as the final major infrastructure point along the Godavari's course, regulating the downstream flow of freshwater into the BoB. Daily measurements of water released from the Dowleiswaram barrage provided a high- resolution record of GRD variations. These daily values were subsequently aggregated to generate monthly mean time series data spanning 29 years (1990-2018). The use of Dowleiswaram barrage discharge as a proxy for total GRD into the BoB is justified due to several factors. First, the barrage captures the vast majority of the Godavari's freshwater input, as evidenced by minimal tributaries downstream. Second, the relatively short distance (50 km) between the barrage and the BoB minimizes potential losses through evaporation or tributary inputs. This time series data of mean monthly GRD serve as a key foundation for our investigation of the river's influence on coastal BoB dynamics. Due to confidentiality restrictions, the GRD data used in this study were not publicly available. The data was obtained from Superintending Engineer, Irrigation Circle, Dhavaleswaram, Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh (https://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/home; scicbowlm@gmail.com).This study leverages Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-ARGO) data, a critical component of the Global Ocean Observing System (Notarstefano, 2020), to provide high-resolution in situ station observations in the vicinity of the Godavari River mouth. Within the extensive BGC-ARGO network, we identified two floats (2902264 and 2902193) strategically positioned within the plume of low-saline GRD. The precise locations of these floats are presented in Figure 1, along with their temporal and location information in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S1, S2. These two floats provided individual quality-controlled profiles of various oceanographic parameters. Float 2902193 completed 184 data cycles, with three profiles (cycles 49, 59, and 71) acquired within the vicinity of the GRD region through the fall to early winter (mid-September to December). Float 2902264 completed 268 cycles, with three profiles (cycles 41, 44, and 60) in the GRD region through the fall to the winter months (mid-October to January). Both floats were stationed outside the GRD region for the remaining data cycles. Consequently, only the three profiles acquired within the GRD region, as outlined above, were utilized for the analysis of dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, and particle backscattering coefficient information at 700 nm (bb700) in this study. The DO measurements offer insights into potential oxygen depletion associated with enhanced organic matter decomposition driven by the GRD influx. Chl-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, acts as a marker of primary productivity potentially stimulated by nutrient enrichment from the river discharge. Finally, the particle backscattering coefficient serves as an indicator of the presence and type of suspended particles, including phytoplankton and non-living organic matter, which the GRD dynamics can influence. By scrutinizing these critical variables from the strategically located BGC-ARGO floats, we aim to provide robust observational evidence to confirm and refine our understanding of the Godavari River's impact on the biogeochemical dynamics of the coastal BoB region. We obtained BGC-ARGO data from https:// biogeochemical-argo.org/data-access.php. To gain further insights into potential spatial biogeochemical responses to the GRD, we also drew upon complementary datasets from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=chlor_ a&amp;page=0.=monthly&amp;version=1&amp;limit=24&amp;from=2002- 01-01&amp;to=2016-01-01&amp;mode=download#results). This fresh initiative provides a robust, merged Level 3 product for monthly mean Chl-a concentrations from 2002 to 2016. This valuable resource utilizes satellite observations from diverse sensors, including Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MERIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), seamlessly combined to offer a comprehensive and spatially extensive view of phytoplankton biomass across the global ocean (Sathyendranath et al., 2019). The 4 km spatial resolution of the OC-CCI Chl-a data strikes a balance between capturing local dynamics near the Godavari estuary and providing regional context for the observed patterns. To further elucidate the potential impact of GRD on primary productivity, we also leverage monthly mean net primary productivity (NPP) data obtained from the same OC-CCI website for the same timeframe (2002-2016) (https://www.oceancolour.org/browser/index.php?product=pp&amp;page=0&amp;limit=24&amp;from=2002-01-01&amp;to=2016-01- 01&amp;mode=browse#results). NPP is estimated using the Ocean Production from the Absorption of Light (OPAL) model. This model builds upon the framework originally proposed by Marra et al. (2003). NPP is integrated over the euphotic zone and expressed in grams of carbon per square meter of sea surface (g C m-2). Four key satellite-derived inputs that are assimilated into OPAL are surface Chl- a concentration, sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation reaching the ocean surface, and the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter. A detailed description of the NPP calculations is available in O'Reilly (2017). This dataset provides a valuable quantitative estimate of the rate at which organic matter is produced by Chl-a-rich phytoplankton biomass within the coastal BoB region. By analyzing the co-variation between Chl-a, and NPP, we aim to gain insights into the potential stimulation of primary productivity by nutrient enrichment associated with the GRD. The World Ocean Atlas 2018 (WOA18) serves as a cornerstone resource for this study, providing a comprehensive set of objectively analyzed climatological fields for the world ocean (https:// www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/world-ocean-atlas-2018/). These fields, derived from in-situ measurements, encompass various oceanographic parameters at standard depth levels across different grid resolutions (5&#176; &#215; 5&#176;, 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176;, and 0.25&#176; &#215; 0.25&#176;). Specifically, the data includes annual, seasonal, and monthly climatologies of temperature, salinity, DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate. The annual and seasonal climatologies extend to an impressive depth of 5,500 m, encompassing 102 distinct vertical levels. However, for monthly climatologies, the data extends only up to 1,500 m (57 vertical levels), still providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of near-surface ocean processes. Additionally, the chemical parameters (such as DO, phosphate, silicate, and nitrate) are available only on a 5&#176; &#215; 5&#176; and a 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176; horizontal resolution. This choice balances the need for a detailed spatial resolution within the coastal BoB region with the data availability and reliability constraints inherent in monthly climatologies. In this study, we used the monthly climatological salinity (Zweng et al., 2018) on a 0.25&#176; &#215; 0.25&#176; grid, and dissolved oxygen (Garcia et al., 2019) at a 1&#176; &#215; 1&#176; resolution. By leveraging this robust and authoritative dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of dissolved oxygen and their potential association with the influence of GRD. The monthly mean horizontal and vertical current data (2000-2020) from the Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) developed by the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) is used to elucidate the seasonal dynamics of coastal circulation and upwelling near the Godavari River mouth. This advanced reanalysis product (replacing Reanalysis 6) serves as the initial oceanic state for the NCEP's Climate Forecast System (Saha et al., 2006). The GODAS is forced by the momentum flux, heat flux, and freshwater flux. It utilizes a quasi-global configuration of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) MOM.v3 model, encompassing the critical coastal zone with high-resolution grids (1&#176; x 1&#176;, enhanced to 1/3&#176; near the equator) and 40 vertical levels (10 m resolution in the upper 200 m). Leveraging these capabilities of the GODAS data (https:// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/GODAS/), we estimated the divergence and upwelling of the GRD region. The divergence field represents the net flow of fluid into or out of a specific region and is calculated as the sum of the partial derivatives of the horizontal velocity components (u and v) with respect to x and y, respectively. Positive divergence leads to upwelling as surface water is drawn away, allowing deeper water to rise and replace it.The monthly distribution of the various physical and biogeochemical fields near the GRD region displays interesting signatures (Supplementary Figures S1&#8211;S4). Since a detailed analysis of each month will be too descriptive, we focus on January, April, July, and October to examine the evolution of various fields in the boreal seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. GRD exhibits a strong seasonality driven by the Southwest Monsoon (SWM) season. Monthly climatology (Figure 2A) reveals a peak discharge exceeding 4700 m3.s-1 in August, coinciding with peak SWM rainfall. Subsequently, GRD declines through September, October, and November, becoming negligible by December. Surface salinity distribution (Figure 2B) generally shows a freshening trend during fall due to the equatorward movement of the West India Coastal Current (WICC) transporting low-salinity waters from the northern BoB. Interestingly, GRD also contributes significantly to this freshening during the SWM season, causing a decrease in over 2 practical salinity units (psu) near the river mouth compared to the pre- monsoon values. From summer to winter, salinity becomes the dominant factor controlling near-surface density stratification. This stratification results in a shallow mixed layer and the formation of a thick barrier layer. The shallow mixed layer restricts the exchange of air-sea fluxes, while the barrier layer suppresses mass and energy exchange between the surface layers and the deeper ocean interior. In short, though the relative contribution of fresh water from GRD is negligible compared to other rivers (Sarma et al., 2016), it has the potential to impact the physical and biogeochemical state of the BoB, especially near the Godavari River mouth region. GRD profoundly amplifies spatiotemporal Chl-a dynamics in the BoB during the SWM season (Figure 2C). Pre-monsoon and winter months are characterized by Chl-a concentrations lingering well below 0.4 mg.m-3, indicative of quiescent phytoplankton growth. In stark contrast, the SWM season ushers in a vibrant pulse of primary productivity, propelling Chl-a to peak values exceeding 2.2 mg.m-3 within a significantly expanded spatial footprint encompassing regions up to 83&#176;E around the river mouth (Figure 2C). This pronounced Chl-a bloom intricately mirrors the fluctuations in GRD, diminishing in intensity as the monsoon recedes. The riverine influx of nutrients orchestrates this dramatic seasonal spectacle, directly fueling phytoplankton proliferation and consequently boosting regional NPP, as depicted in Figure 2D. NPP exhibits a gradual ascent from April that culminates at the onset of SWM, and surges beyond 1000 mgC.m-2 by July. However, with the waning of the monsoon and subsequent decline in GRD, NPP undergoes a steep drop, leaving the river mouth region with markedly reduced productivity by October. Thus, the annual peak in GRD serves as a potent force, not only inducing vertical stratification but also transforming the BoB into a highly productive ecosystem during the SWM season. The thriving phytoplankton blooms fueled by enhanced nutrients from the Godavari River are projected to contribute to a significant suspension of organic matter in subsurface BoB waters. To gain insights into this process, we utilized particle backscatter data from two BGC-ARGO floats (2902264 and 2902193) deployed near the river mouth (Figure 1). These floats offered three individual profiles spanning the SWM to winter seasons, allowing us to analyze the organic matter dynamics across contrasting productivity regimes. Details of the data acquisition and processing are provided in Table 1. The BGC-ARGO float 2902264 revealed a pronounced peak in particle backscatter (&gt;0.002 m-1), coinciding with elevated Chl-a concentrations (&gt;3.5 mg m-3) at depths between 30 and 50 m in October 2018 (Figures 1A, B). This peak, located at a depth of 40-50 m, suggests a substantial abundance of organic matter during peak productivity. By November, the intensity of the particle backscatter peak diminished to 0.00165 m-1 at 39 m, accompanied by a reduction in Chl-a to 1.5 mg.m-3 at 37 m. This decline implied a weakening of organic matter abundance as productivity decreased. Notably, while the extreme particle backscatter peaks were absent by January 2019, Chl-a exhibited a secondary peak at 48 m, albeit with a lower magnitude (&lt;0.8 mg.m- 3). This suggests a potential decoupling between Chl-a and organic particle suspension during this period. Data from BGC-ARGO float 2902193 qualitatively support the observed patterns from float 2902264 (Figures 1C, D) in the upper 80 m of the water column. The highest values for both particle backscatter (&gt;0.003 m-1) and Chl-a (&gt;3.5 mg.m-3) were observed during November 2016 (late fall/early winter season) at depths between 25 and 40 m. The peak particle backscatter (&gt;0.003 m-1) occurred at 38 m, while the peak Chl-a (&gt;3.5 mg.m-3) was slightly shallower at 28 m. These elevated values suggest an enhanced production and possible export of organic matter during the fall, following the peak productivity of the SWM. However, the September 2016 data showed lower particle backscatter (&lt;0.0028 m-1) and significantly reduced Chl-a (&lt;1.9 mg.m-3), indicating weaker organic matter suspension preceding the fall peak. Interestingly, while December 2016 exhibited the highest particle backscatter value (&gt;0.0032 m-1) between 85 and 95 m, Chl-a concentrations remained very low (&lt;1 mg.m-3) at depths between 30 and 80 m. This discrepancy suggests a potential decoupling between particle export and phytoplankton biomass at deeper depths during this period. Thus, our analysis of the BGC-ARGO data from both floats indicates a seasonal pattern of enhanced Chl-a inducing an elevated particle backscatter underneath it, along with increased organic matter abundance near the Godavari River mouth region, particularly at depths between 25 and 55 m during the fall season. Furthermore, this abundance appears to be linked to elevated Chl-a and NPP during the preceding SWM season.Hence, GRD significantly impacts the river mouth region during the SWM season through a multifaceted interplay of stratification, primary productivity, and organic matter abundance. The pronounced stratification resulting from a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer generated by GRD restricts vertical mixing, potentially minimizing DO transport from the surface to subsurface layers. Simultaneously, the riverine influx of nutrients fuels phytoplankton growth, leading to enhanced Chl-a concentrations and culminating in elevated NPP. This primary productivity surge drives organic matter export into subsurface layers, potentially capable of influencing DO distribution through microbial decomposition processes. In conclusion, the combined effects of altered stratification, intensified primary productivity at the surface, and organic matter sinking into subsurface layers during the post-SWM season are likely to significantly modify the DO distribution (both horizontal and vertical) near the Godavari River mouth region. The region near the Godavari River mouth lies within the BoB- OMZ, a persistent feature characterized by year-round hypoxic conditions at intermediate depths (200-1,000 m). This section focuses on the potential impact of enhanced organic matter sinking during the SWM and early fall seasons on the distribution of DO and the dynamics (intensity and upper limit) of the BoB-OMZ in the Godavari River mouth region. Analysis of DO profiles from BGC-ARGO floats near the Godavari River mouth reveals the presence of an OMZ (DO within 0-0.5 ml.l-1) between 50 to 800 m (average depth levels), with a dynamic response to seasonal changes in organic matter input (Figure 3). Both floats exhibit a shoaling and intensification of the OMZ during the fall season, indicating a potential influence of riverine flow on DO consumption. At float 2902264, the upper limit of the OMZ deepened from 40-45 m in October 2018 (DO ~ 0 ml.l-1) to 50m in November (DO ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and to 100 m by January 2019 (DO ~0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 3A). This pattern suggests a gradual deepening of the OMZ as surface productivity declined and oxygen consumption in subsurface layers for microbial respiration reduced. Float 2902193 exhibited a similar trend, with the upper OMZ boundary at 35-40 m in November 2016 (following the SWM with a DO of ~ 0 ml.l-1), which was as deep as 75 m in September (pre-SWM with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) and further down to 105 m in December (with a DO of ~ 0.2 ml.l-1) (Figure 3B). These observations collectively suggest a significant shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth during the fall season. Thus, the enhanced Chl-a and particle backscatter (between 25 and 55 m depth) during the fall season driven by GRD (Figure 1) coincides with shoaling and intensification of the OMZ near the Godavari River mouth. This provides strong evidence for the potential impact of high organic matter sinking on the dynamics of the BoB-OMZ. The limited availability of BGC-ARGO observations in the GRD region restricts our ability to investigate the seasonal evolution of DO. Therefore, we turn to the objectively analyzed WOA18 DO data, despite its coastal data gap. WOA18 offers sufficient coverage (&gt;80% data availability) for a 63-year period (1955-2017), enabling seasonal analysis of various ocean fields. Figures 4A&#8211;D display the vertical distribution of DO (surface to 500 m) in the BoB near GRD (16.8&#176;N) during different seasons, derived from WOA18. High DO concentrations (&gt;4-5 ml.l-1) characterize the basin's surface layers (~0-80 m) year-round. Below this, the OMZ prevails, with its upper boundary primarily residing between 80-200 m, exhibiting seasonal and spatial variations. Winter and spring months reveal similar spatial patterns of the OMZ (Figures 4A, B), with its upper limit confined between 80-110 m depth. A pronounced OMZ (DO &lt; 0.3 ml.l-1) persists below 500 m throughout these seasons. Summer (July) exhibits distinct spatial patterns from the previous two seasons (Figure 4C). Except for a narrow depth range (200-250 m, 92.5-93.5&#176;E), DO levels below the mixed layer generally remain above 0.2 ml.l-1. Additionally, the OMZ upper boundary in the western basin deepens to 110-130 m. The fall season witnesses the most profound OMZ expansion and intensification near the western basin, where the Godavari River discharges (Figure 4D). DO levels below 0.1 ml.l-1 appear between 60-175 m in this region, a stark contrast to summer values of 1-1.5 ml.l-1 (Figure 4C). The shoaling and intensification of the OMZ at subsurface depths (40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth, evident in the BGC- ARGO and WOA18 data during fall, necessitates further investigation. To validate this localized phenomenon, we delved deeper into the seasonal evolution of DO within this critical depth range (40-200 m) in the western BoB (Figures 4E&#8211;H). Winter reveals a clear influx of highly oxygenated water from the southern BoB (Figure 4E), aided by the prevailing ocean current system (Figure 2B). This influx maintains sufficient DO (&gt;1 ml.l-1) in the western BoB throughout winter and spring (Figures 4E, F). Even in summer (July) (Figure 4G), subsurface DO (averaged over 40-200 m) near the Godavari River mouth remains moderate, exceeding 1.2 ml.l-1. However, a dramatic shift occurs in the fall (October) as the region transforms into an oxygen-depleted zone (&lt;0.5 ml.l-1) (Figure 4H). This stark contrast highlights the dynamic seasonal cycle of subsurface DO in the western BoB. While oxygenated waters prevail near the Godavari delta basin during winter, spring, and summer, a localized and intense OMZ establishes itself near the river mouth during fall. Thus, coinciding with the retreat of the SWM season, the confluence of increased organic matter input from the Godavari River and enhanced stratification likely contributes to the generation of an intense and shallow subsurface OMZ (40-200 m) near the river mouth. The genesis and dynamics of the pronounced subsurface OMZ observed near the GRD region after the retreat of the SWM season are likely influenced by a complex interplay of physical and biogeochemical factors. In this section, we focus on analyzing other processes such as surface ocean circulation and divergence in the western BoB near the GRD region (Figure 5) using GODAS data, recognizing their crucial role in upwelling and associated biogeochemical processes influencing OMZ dynamics. The surface circulation in the western BoB exhibits distinct seasonal patterns near the Godavari River mouth, playing a crucial role in regional upwelling and potentially influencing the observed OMZ dynamics. The pre-Southwest Monsoon and SWM seasons are characterized by strong northward coastal currents and an eastward current across the BoB, as shown in Figures 5B, C, respectively. Additionally, during the SWM season, south-westerly winds induce positive divergence along the western BoB coast, favoring coastal upwelling (Figure 5C). Following the retreat of the SWM season, the strong monsoon currents subside, and southward- moving coastal currents dominate the western BoB (Figure 5D). This shift creates favorable conditions for upwelling near the GRD region and northwards, indicated by positive surface divergence (Figure 5D). Winter (January) sees a further weakening of the southward current, and positive divergence persists near the GRD region, suggesting continued upwelling potential (Figure 5A). Thus the oceanic region near the GRD experiences favorable conditions for upwelling throughout the SWM, fall, and late winter periods due to the combined influence of surface currents and divergence. This sustained upwelling could potentially contribute to the observed surge in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), NPP, and the subsequent intensification and vertical expansion (shoaling) of the OMZ observed after the retreat of the SWM season. To provide insights into the interplay between GRD and upwelling in shaping dissolved DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB, we selected two geographically distinct study regions. Box A (82-84&#176;E, 15.5-17&#176;N) lies directly at the Godavari River mouth, maximizing its exposure to GRD influence and benefiting from favorable upwelling conditions during the SWM season. In contrast, Box B (84-86&#176;E, 17-18.5&#176;N), located slightly north, experiences minimized GRD influence while retaining similar upwelling conditions during the SWM season. This strategic selection allows for a comparative analysis, disentangling the individual and combined effects of GRD and upwelling on DO and OMZ dynamics. Figure 6 represents the seasonal evolution of vertical velocity (GODAS data), and those of Chl-a (OC-CCI data), NPP (OC-CCI), and depth-averaged (40-200 m) dissolved oxygen (WOA18 data) in these two selected oceanic regions. The analysis unfolds similar qualitative patterns for vertical velocity (upwelling) in both boxes. In both the oceanic regions, upwelling increases with the emergence of the SWM season and starts declining with its withdrawal. In comparison, Box A records higher values for upwelling than Box B (Figure 6A). The highest upwelling was recorded in July in both boxes, 0.72&#215;10-5 m.s-1 in Box A and 0.58&#215;10-5 m.s-1 in Box B. The increase in upwelling during the SWM season clearly reflects the seasonal evolution of Chl-a in Box A, whereas Box B shows a slight decreasing trend from June to July, although it maintained an overall increasing trend during the SWM season (Figure 6B). Both the regions reflected mild Chl-a values during rest of the year. In comparison, Chl-a blooms in Box A (0.8-0.9 mg.m-3) were almost twice as intense as Box B (0.4-0.5 mg.m-3) during the SWM season. NPP also showed a similar seasonal signature (Figure 6C). Both boxes highlighted an increasing trend in NPP during the SWM season and showed similar patterns during the rest of the year. Similar to the Chl-a distribution, Box A recorded very high (&gt; 1100 mgC.m-3) NPP distribution compared to Box B (&lt; 850 mgC.m-3) during the SWM season. The rise in Chl- a and NPP during the SWM season significantly impacted seasonal DO fluctuations in both study regions (Figure 6D). While DO exhibited a mildly increasing trend in both boxes during late winter and pre-monsoon, it displayed a substantial decline with the onset of the SWM season. In Box A, DO plummeted from 3 ml.l-1 in May to a critical low of 0.1 ml.l-1 in October (fall), representing a drastic decrease of 2.9 ml.l-1. In contrast, Box B experienced a smaller decline, with DO decreasing from 2.2 ml.l-1 in June to an average of 0.55 ml.l-1 during fall (September-November), representing a decrease of 1.75 ml.l-1. In conclusion, it is evident that SWM- driven biogeochemical activity was significantly enhanced in Box A, directly influenced by GRD, leading to pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. This comparative analysis highlights the crucial role of GRD in shaping DO and OMZ dynamics in the BoB. This study delves into the profound biogeochemical impact of GRD in the BoB, with a particular focus on the region near the river mouth. Our key finding is the intriguing presence of an intense and shallow OMZ within the subsurface (40-200 m) depths near the Godavari River mouth during the post-monsoon season which has hardly been mentioned previously. Notably, this phenomenon differs from the conventional intermediate-depth BoB-OMZ prevalent in the basin (McCreary et al., 2013). The temporal evolution of this shallow OMZ was elucidated through data from two BGC-ARGO floats located close to the river discharge region. Their observations revealed a clear intensification and shoaling of the OMZ during fall. To unveil the spatial extent and context of this phenomenon, we leveraged the broader coverage of WOA18 data, facilitating comparisons with other crucial variables. Furthermore, to disentangle the relative influence of GRD and upwelling on OMZ dynamics, we conducted a comparative analysis in two geographically distinct locations. This comparative analysis proved the pivotal role of GRD in shaping the biogeochemical environment near the river mouth. Despite both regions experiencing similar upwelling patterns, the area directly influenced by GRD exhibited significantly higher Chl-a blooms, enhanced NPP during the SWM season, and a more pronounced oxygen consumption during fall. These observations strongly suggest that the extensive nutrient influx from GRD fuels increased primary productivity, leading to enhanced organic matter suspension and subsequent oxygen depletion in the subsurface layers, culminating in the observed intense and shallow OMZ. Our findings paint a compelling picture of the substantial influence of GRD on BoB biogeochemistry, particularly in the vicinity of the river mouth. Briefly, during the SWM season, the influx of nutrients from GRD, combined with enhanced coastal upwelling, creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton blooms. These blooms, peaking in August and September, are characterized by high Chl-a concentrations and lead to a surge in NPP. However, this elevated productivity comes with a subsequent cost. As the blooms senesce and decompose by fall, an elevation in suspended organic matter at the subsurface depths (40-200 m) develops. This organic matter fuels the activity of heterotrophic microbial communities, leading to intense oxygen consumption through respiration. This microbial respiration, coupled with the reduced atmospheric oxygen supply due to strong stratification, drives the shoaling and intensification of the OMZ off the Godavari River mouth. Understanding and quantifying these impacts are crucial for various reasons. First, alterations in GRD can directly affect primary productivity and food webs in the coastal zone. Second, changes in the OMZ's intensity can influence the release of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O, potentially impacting global climate change. Finally, understanding the dynamic interplay between riverine inputs, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes is critical for predicting and managing the future state of the BoB ecosystem. In summary, although the discharge of the Godavari River is negligible compared to other rivers flowing into the BoB, GRD plays a pivotal role in shaping the biogeochemistry of the bay, with profound impacts on primary productivity, oxygen dynamics, and greenhouse gas emissions. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricate interactions between GRD, upwelling, and biogeochemical processes, and to predict the consequences of future alterations in riverine inputs on this vital ecosystem. It should, however, be noted that the interpretations derived from our analysis are subject to the limited temporal and spatial sample extent, which precludes us from any statistical significance test of the results. We are in the process of initiating a few high-resolution sensitivity experiments with the ocean model that will be 15-20 years long. The outputs will enable us to quantify the contributions of each parameter separately.</description>

                Background: Anatomic burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been considered a consistent prognostic marker. Inflammation also increases the cardiovascular risk and plays a significant role in the evolution of atherosclerosis. The progression of CAD impacts the responses to exercise, reducing functional capacity. Despite this knowledge, the specific interplay between inflammation and atherosclerotic burden in influencing submaximal exercise capacity, particularly oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) kinetics, remains underexplored in CAD. This study aims to investigate how these factors correlate with VO 2 on-kinetics in the Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT) in patients with CAD. METHODS: Patients with obstructive CAD, confirmed by coronary angiography, underwent a 6MWT using a mobile telemetric cardiopulmonary monitoring to assess functional capacity and the VO 2 on-kinetics through the mean response time corrected by work (wMRT). Inflammatory markers were analyzed by dosage of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interferon-gama, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins (IL), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Coronary atherosclerotic burden was evaluated by the Grading Scale for Anatomic Burden of Disease from COURAGE Trial. Correlation analyses were performed according to the symmetric distribution of data, using Pearson&#8217;s (r) or Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficients(r s ). RESULTS: A total of thirty-four patients aged between 60.3&#177;8.0 years were enrolled, presenting body mass index of 26.0&#177;3.7kg/cm 2 , left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.50&#177;0.14, walking distance of 443&#177;66m, VO 2 at steady-state (VO 2SS ) of 896&#177;240ml/min and wMRT of 1.64x10 -3 &#177; 1.00x10 -3 min 2 /ml. Although correlated with distance and VO 2SS (r=-0.472;p=0.002 and r=-0.434;p=0.015, respectively), atherosclerotic burden was not associated with wMRT (p=0.17). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and IL-8 were negatively associated with both distance and VO 2SS (r s =-0.428;p=0.001/ r s =-0.543;p=0.001 and r s =-0.438;p=0.014/ r s =-0.407;p=0.019) and positively correlated with wMRT (r s =0.412;p=0.022/ r s =0.505;p=0.003). CONCLUSION: In contrast to anatomic burden, inflammatory markers were associated with both walking intensity and VO 2 kinetics. Therefore, inflammation may be more crucial to exercise response mechanisms than coronary stenosis, suggesting a paradigm shift in our understanding of clinical repercussions of obstructive CAD. Actions able to attenuate the inflammatory profile may improve exercise capacity and prognosis.</description>

                Abstract The mass&#8211;metallicity relation provides crucial insights into the baryon cycle in galaxies and strong constraints on galaxy formation models. We use JWST NIRSpec observations from the UNCOVER program to measure the gas-phase metallicity in a sample of eight galaxies during the epoch of reionization at z = 6&#8211;8. Thanks to the strong lensing of the galaxy cluster Abell 2744, we are able to probe extremely low stellar masses between 10 6 and 10 8 M &#8857; . Using strong-line diagnostics and the most recent JWST calibrations, we derive extremely low oxygen abundances in the range of 12 + log(O/H) = 6.7&#8211;7.8. By combining this sample with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts, we derive a best-fit relation of 12 + log(O/H) =  &#8722;   0.076   &#8722; 0.03   + 0.03   &#215;   ( log (   M   &#8902;   ) )   2   +   1.61   &#8722; 0.52   + 0.52    &#215;  log (   M   &#8902;   ) &#8722;   0.26   &#8722; 0.10   + 0.10    , which becomes steeper than determinations at z &#8764; 3&#8211;6 toward low-mass galaxies. Our results show a clear redshift evolution in the overall normalization of the relation, galaxies at higher redshift having significantly lower metallicities at a given mass. A comparison with theoretical models provides important constraints on which physical processes, such as metal mixing, star formation or feedback recipes, are important in reproducing the observations. Additionally, these galaxies exhibit star formation rates that are higher by a factor of a few to tens compared to extrapolated relations at similar redshifts or theoretical predictions of main-sequence galaxies, pointing to a recent burst of star formation. All these observations are indicative of the highly stochastic star formation and interstellar medium enrichment expected in these low-mass systems, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in high- z dwarf galaxies might be different from those in place at higher masses.</description>
