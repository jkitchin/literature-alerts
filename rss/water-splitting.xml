                Electrochemical production of green hydrogen via water-splitting is an emerging technology to generate a substitute source of energy. However, due to the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), high cost, lesser availability and easy oxidation of noble metal-based electrocatalysts led the explorers to find an efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts. In the current communication, we have developed a synthesis strategy for the preparation of hybrid electrocatalyst composed of bimetallic (iron, nickel) based metal organic framework (FeNiBTC MOF) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) via solvothermal reaction. Thanks to the ultrathin heterostructure with high electrical conductivity of MXene, with abundant active sites of FeNiBTC MOF, the as-prepared hybrid electrocatalyst FeNiBTC@MXene, leads the high efficiency OER in an alkaline environment. FeNiBTC MOF was impeccably decorated on the surfaces of MXene nanosheets with different FeNiBTC to MXene ratios and was characterized via pXRD, FESEM/EDS, XPS and BET. The optimized hybrid structured catalyst (FeNiBTC@Mx-3) revealed the best performance for OER with a low overpotential of 210 mV vs. RHE at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel plot value of 38.4 mV/dec and stable up to 1000th CV cycles.</description>

                The fabrication of effective electrocatalyst is critical for clean hydrogen generation via electrochemical water splitting. As potentials candidates, carbon-based materials are likely to explore with in depth role as efficient, low cost and noncorrosive electrocatalysts. To this end, we used a facile hydrothermal technique to fabricate noble as well as transition metal catalysts on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (MO@rGO, MO = AgO and ZnO) for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). X-ray diffraction pattern and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the nano sized range of synthesized AgO@rGO and ZnO@rGO electrocatalysts with high crystallinity and enhanced surface area to volume ratio by comprising the size of 37.17 nm and 27.89 nm, respectively. The OER performance of AgO and ZnO based rGO nanocomposites demonstrate a particularly high productivity, achieving current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at the overpotentials of 1.67 V and 1.70 V, respectively. The overpotential values and Tafel slopes were found to be 440 mV, 184 mV dec&#8722;1 and 470 mV, 212 mV dec&#8722;1 for AgO@rGO and ZnO@rGO respectively. Moreover, double layer capacitance of ZnO@rGO was recorded 38.02 &#956;F cm&#8722;2 indicating higher electrochemical surface area as compared to AgO@rGO which was 15.2 &#956;F cm&#8722;2. Chronoamperometric values also provide supportive results elaborating effectiveness of the reported materials as efficient electrocatalysts towards OER.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Modification of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Nanosheet Arrays with Enhanced Water Oxidation Activity and Stability by Nitrogen Plasma</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c07973</link>
      <description>Yang Liu, Shiqing Zhang, S.Y. Ma, Xinyu Sun, Ying Wang, Fang Liu, Y Li, Yuanhui Ma, Xuewen Xu, Yanming Xue, Chengchun Tang, Jun Zhang, ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400314625

                The strategic design of catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial in tackling the substantial energy demands associated with hydrogen production in electrolytic water splitting. Despite extensive research on birnessite (&#948;-MnO2) manganese oxides to enhance catalytic activity by modulating Mn3+ species, the ongoing challenge is to simultaneously stabilize Mn3+ while improving overall activity. Herein, oxygen (O) vacancies and nitrogen (N) doping have been simultaneously introduced into the MnO2 through a simple nitrogen plasma approach, resulting in efficient OER performance. The optimized N-MnO2v electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding OER activity in alkaline electrolyte, reducing the overpotential by nearly 160 mV compared to pure pristine MnO2 (from 476 to 312 mV) at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a small Tafel slope of 89 mV dec&#8211;1. Moreover, it demonstrates excellent durability over a 122 h stability test. The introduction of O vacancies and incorporation of N not only fine-tune the electronic structure of MnO2, increasing the Mn3+ content to enhance overall activity, but also play a crucial role in stabilizing Mn3+, thereby leading to exceptional stability over time. Subsequently, density functional theory calculations validate the optimized electronic structure of MnO2 achieved through the two engineering methods, effectively lowering the intermediate adsorption free energy barrier. Our synergistic approach, utilizing nitrogen plasma treatment, opens a pathway to concurrently enhance the activity and stability of OER electrocatalysts, applicable not only to Mn-based but also to other transition metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Electronic transfer and structural reconstruction in porous NF/FeNiP-CoP@NC heterostructure for robust overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.07.019</link>
      <description>Qingqing Zhang, Xiaojun Zeng, Zuliang Zhang, Chulong Jin, Yuanyuan Cui, Yanfeng Gao, Journal of colloid and interface science. 675(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400315288

                Multimetal phosphides derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest owing to their distinct electronic configurations and abundant active sites. However, developing robust and efficient catalysts based on metal phosphides for overall water splitting (OWS) remains challenging. Herein, we present an approach for synthesizing a self-supporting hollow porous cubic FeNiP-CoP@NC catalyst on a nickel foam (NF) substrate. Through ion exchange, the reconstruction chemistry transforms the FeNi-MOF nanospheres into intricate hollow porous FeNi-MOF-Co nanocubes. After phosphorization, numerous N, P co-doped carbon-coated FeNiP-CoP nanoparticles were tightly embedded within a two-dimensional (2D) carbon matrix. The NF/FeNiP-CoP@NC heterostructure retained a porous configuration, numerous heterogeneous interfaces, distinct defects, and a rich composition of active sites. Moreover, incorporating Co and the resulting structural evolution facilitated the electron transfer in FeNiP-CoP@NC, enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) processes. Consequently, the NF/FeNiP-CoP@NC catalyst demonstrated very low overpotentials of 78 mV for OER and 254 mV for HER in an alkaline medium. It also exhibited excellent long-term stability at various potentials (@10 mA cm&#8722;2, @20 mA cm&#8722;2, and @50 mA cm&#8722;2). As an overall water splitting cell, it required only 1.478 V to drive a current density of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a synergistic effect between multimetal phosphides, enhancing the intrinsic OER and HER activities of FeNiP-CoP@NC. This work not only elucidates the role of heteroatom induction in structural reconstruction but also highlights the importance of electronic structure modulation.</description>

      <title>Synergistic structure engineering and electrochemical activation modulating vanadium oxide cathode toward superior zinc-ion storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153736</link>
      <description>Kan Fang, Heng Zhang, Peng Chen, Huayu Zhang, Wenbin Zhan, Lei Ding, Xiao-Ai Ye, Jiawang Liu, Yilin Liu, Gui&#8208;Gen Wang, Hui Yang, Chemical engineering journal. 496(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400316120

                Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as competitive systems for grid-scale energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the lack of suitable high-performance cathode composites limits the practical progress of ZIBs. Herein, a novel cathode material, ammonium cation-inserted and oxygen vacancy co-modulated VO2 (named NVE), was firstly synthesized through the ethylene glycol (EG) sacrificial solvent-assisted structure transformation with the ammonium vanadate (named NV) as the precursor. The sacrificial solvent promotes the structural transformation of ammonium vanadate to NH4+-intercalated vanadium oxide and enhances the number of oxygen vacancies in the resulting material. Moreover, the electrochemical activation process was performed for in-situ construction of NH4+-inserted hydrated vanadium oxide (V2O5&#183;nH2O) material. The electrochemical activation process with high anodic voltage enables multiple electron reactions, increasing the utilization of vanadium elements and achieving high capacity. Additionally, the formed hydrogen bonds between the V-O host and inserted NH4+ ions can enhance the structural integrity, while the oxygen vacancies decrease the interaction between the V-O host and inserted Zn2+ ions to boost ion diffusion. Consequently, the resulting activated cathode demonstrates higher capacity (441 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g), superior cycling durability (85.6 % retention over 4000 cycles), and exceptional rate capability (205 mAh/g at 20 A/g). Besides, the fabricated devices based on the activated NVE cathode show decent capacity and excellent flexible stability. Furthermore, the reversible electrochemical Zn2+ storage mechanism upon battery cycling was evaluated by several kinetic measurements and in/ex-situ characterizations. This work provides novel perspectives for the fabrication of advanced cathode materials for superior aqueous ZIBs.</description>

      <title>Cobalt nanoparticles intercalation coupled with tellurium-doping MXene for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.07.025</link>
      <description>Yousen Wu, Ying Wang, Guozhe Sui, Huiyuan Ma, Dawei Chu, Guang Xu, Jinlong Li, Yue Li, Dong&#8208;Feng Chai, Journal of colloid and interface science. 675(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400316469

                Nowadays, the inherent re-stacking nature and weak d-p hybridization orbital interactions within MXene remains significant challenges in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting, leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability. Herein, this work aims to address these challenges and improve electrocatalytic performance by utilizing cobalt nanoparticles intercalation coupled with enhanced &#960;-donation effect. Specifically, cobalt nanoparticles are integrated into V2C MXene nanosheets to mitigate the re-stacking issue. Meanwhile, a notable charge redistribution from cobalt to vanadium elevates orbital levels, reduces &#960;*-antibonding orbital occupancy and alleviates Jahn-Teller distortion. Doping with tellurium induces localized electric field rearrangement resulting from the changes in electron cloud density. As a result, Co-V2C MXene-Te acquires desirable activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with the overpotential of 80.8 mV and 287.7 mV, respectively, at the current density of &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mA cm&#8722;2. The overall water splitting device achieves an impressive low cell voltage requirement of 1.51 V to obtain 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Overall, this work could offer a promising solution when facing the re-stacking issue and weak d-p hybridization orbital interactions of MXene, furnishing a high-performance electrocatalyst with favorable electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability.</description>

      <title>Correlating Thickness and Phase of Single Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Micro&#8208;Platelets to the Intrinsic Activity of Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                Abstract Morphology, crystal phase, and its transformation are important structures that frequently determine electrocatalytic activity, but the correlations of intrinsic activity with them are not completely understood. Herein, using Co(OH) 2 micro&#8208;platelets with well&#8208;defined structures (phase, thickness, area, and volume) as model electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction, multiple in situ microscopy is combined to correlate the electrocatalytic activity with morphology, phase, and its transformation. Single&#8208;entity morphology and electrochemistry characterized by atomic force microscopy and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy reveal a thickness&#8208;dependent turnover frequency (TOF) of &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 . The TOF (&#8776;9.5 s &#8722;1 ) of &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 with &#8776;14 nm thickness is &#8776;95&#8208;fold higher than that (&#8776;0.1 s &#8722;1 ) with &#8776;80 nm. Moreover, this thickness&#8208;dependent activity has a critical thickness of &#8776;30 nm, above which no thickness&#8208;dependence is observed. Contrarily, &#946;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 reveals a lower TOF (&#8776;0.1 s &#8722;1 ) having no significant correlation with thickness. Combining single&#8208;entity electrochemistry with in situ Raman microspectroscopy, this thickness&#8208;dependent activity is explained by more reversible Co 3+ /Co 2+ kinetics and larger ratio of active Co sites of thinner &#945;&#8208;Co(OH) 2 , accompanied with faster phase transformation and more extensive surface restructuration. The findings highlight the interactions among thickness, ratio of active sites, kinetics of active sites, and phase transformation, and offer new insights into structure&#8211;activity relationships at single&#8208;entity level.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Composition Regulations of Air Electrodes Enable Efficient Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions for Reversible Solid Oxide Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202401048</link>
      <description>Feng Zhu, Zhiwei Du, Kang Xu, Fan He, Yangsen Xu, Yuhe Liao, Yu Chen, Advanced energy materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400323951

                Abstract One of the urgent challenges for efficient energy storage/conversion devices is the poor electrocatalytic activity and reversible operation capability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the air electrodes. Recently, tremendous efforts of high&#8208;entropy air electrodes are devoted, yet the performance enhancement is often ascribed to the high&#8208;entropy. Herein, the effects of the increase of configurational entropy and the selection of specifically doped elements are investigated on the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. These results suggest that the selection of doped elements may contribute more to enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability of air electrodes when compared with the increase of the configurational entropy. Accordingly, the optimized medium&#8208;entropy Pr 1/2 Ba 1/6 Sr 1/6 Ca 1/6 CoO 3&#8208;&#948; (PBSCC) electrode shows superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for ORR and OER. A reversible solid oxide cell utilizing PBSCC demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, conveying a peak power density of 2.01 W cm &#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and a current density of 1.40 A cm &#8722;2 in electrolysis mode (under 50% H 2 O humidified H 2 at 1.3 V) at 750 &#176;C, while maintaining excellent cyclable operation stability for over 115 h.</description>

      <title>Boosting CO2 electrolysis via synergy between active heterogeneous interface and oxygen defects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175417</link>
      <description>Jing Yan, Shufeng Li, Yawei Li, Si&#8208;Dian Li, Jaka Sunarso, Huili Chen, Journal of alloys and compounds. 1002(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400336905

                The commercial viability of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of the electrode materials. In this study, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-&#948; (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx) with different Ni doping levels were synthesized. The results showed that increasing Ni doping led to the creation of more oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere resulted in a structural transformation into a composite with a heterogeneous interface between the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and an exsolved Ni-Fe metal alloy. The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell showed a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 &#176;C and 1.6 V, an improvement of 18% in comparison to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This study provides a strategy to synergistically improve the electrochemical reduction of CO2 activity of SOECs by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.</description>

                Sluggish mass transfer of OH&#8211; in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting from densely packed hydrated layers at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), becomes one of the main bottlenecks to improve overall efficiency of electrochemical devices. Herein, we report a hydration-layer-destabilizing route by binding formate oxyanions onto the catalyst surface to form OH&#8211; transport pathways, favorable for fast OH&#8211; transport and significantly improving OER activity. The electrochemical experiments indicate that surface formate-modified NiCo hydroxide (NiCo&#8211;HCOO&#8211;) shows increased OH&#8211; transfer kinetics, smaller overpotential, and higher turnover frequency (TOF) than that without surface formate modification. The theoretical calculations reveal that surface formate-induced hydrogen-bonding interaction with water molecules could destabilize densely packed hydrated potassium ion layers at the OHP, lowering OH&#8211; transport resistance and paving a pathway for OH&#8211; transfer. The assembled flow electrolyzer with the NiCo&#8211;HCOO&#8211; anode could operate at 400 mA cm&#8211;2 with only 2.1 V for over 300 h. This study provides an efficient strategy for designing high-activity OER electrocatalysts toward advanced energy conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of bimetallic cobalt-molybdenum oxide multihole nanosheets with selenium adulteration as advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts for boosting overall water splitting</title>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting produces green and pollution-free hydrogen as a clean energy carrier, which can effectively alleviate energy crisis. In this paper, bimetallic and selenium doped cobalt molybdate (Se-CoMoO4) nanosheets with rough surface are resoundingly prepared. The multihole Se-CoMoO4 nanosheets display ultrathin and rectangular architecture with the dimensions of &#8764; 3.5 &#956;m and 700 nm for length and width, respectively. The Se-CoMoO4 electrocatalyst shows remarkable water electrolysis activity and stability. The overpotentials of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 270 and 63.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, along with low Tafel slopes of 51.6 and 62.0 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the Se-CoMoO4 couple electrolyzer merely requires a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density and presents no apparent attenuation for 30 h. This investigation declares that the hybridization of transition bimetallic oxide with nonmetallic adulteration can afford a tactic for the preparation of bifunctional non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>A DFT investigation on surface and defect modulation of the Co3O4 catalyst for efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                The electrolysis of a water for hydrogen production is a promising way to produce clean energy, but the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. In this work, we investigated the water oxidation pathways on the perfect and defect Co3O4(111) surfaces by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that for the perfect surface the free energy barrier of the potential determining step (PDS) in the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) of water is lower than that in the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). For the defect surfaces, cobalt vacancies are more easily formed than oxygen vacancies. The Co vacancy promotes the formation of *OH, changes the PDS of the LOM and AEM, and reduces the free energy barrier of both PDS. The PDS of the LOM pathway on the VCo2-Co3O4(111) surface is the coupling step of the O adatom and lattice oxygen, which promotes the LOM process. Different from the OER mechanism on the perfect surface and the defect surface with Co vacancy, the LOM is perferred to occur on the defect surface with O vacancy. This work may provide new insight into the relationship between the surface structure and OER activity surface of the Co3O4 catalyst and help to design the efficient OER catalysts by surface and vacancy engineering.</description>

      <title>In Situ Hydroxide Growth over Nickel&#8211;Iron Phosphide with Enhanced Overall Water Splitting Performances</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402881</link>
      <description>Jian Hu, Jinwei Yin, Aoyuan Peng, Dishu Zeng, Jia-Hong Ke, Jilei Liu, Kaifeng Guo, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400361332

                Abstract In this work, three dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ni&#8208;FeOH@Ni&#8208;FeP needle arrays with core&#8208;shell heterojunction structure are fabricated via in situ hydroxide growth over Ni&#8208;FeP surface. The as&#8208;prepared electrodes show an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, only requiring the low overpotential of 232 mV to reach 200 mA cm &#8722;2 with the Tafel slop of 40 mV dec &#8722;1 . For overall water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer with these electrodes only requires a cell voltage of 2.14 V to reach 1 A cm &#8722;2 . Mechanistic investigations for such excellent electrocatalytic performances are utilized by in situ Raman spectroscopy in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The computation results present that Ni&#8208;FeOH@Ni&#8208;FeP attains better intrinsic conductivity and the D&#8208;band center (close to that of the ideal catalyst), thus giving superior excellent catalytic performances. Likewise, the surface Ni&#8208;FeOH layer can improve the structural stability of Ni&#8208;FeP cores and attenuate the eventual formation of irreversible FeOOH products. More importantly, the appearance of FeOOH intermediates can effectively decrease the energy barrier of NiOOH intermediates, and then rapidly accelerate the sluggish reaction dynamics, as well as further enhance the electrocatalytic activities, reversibility and cycling stability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Cathode Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401176</link>
      <description>Jie Dong, Danil W. Boukhvalov, Cuncai Lv, Mark G. Humphrey, Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400364048

                Due to their abundant active sites and porous structures, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered significant interest as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the development of MOF-based electrocatalysts with efficient OER activity and excellent stability simultaneously still faces challenges. Herein, a cathodic activation strategy was used to enhance the OER electrocatalytic performance of M-HHTP for the first time, where M refers to Ni, Cu, Co, Fe, while HHTP denotes 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11-hexahydroxytriphenylene. As a prototype, the activated Ni-HHTP (HA-Ni-HHTP) demonstrates outstanding OER performance, with an overpotential as low as 140 mV at 20 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 78.7 mV-1, surpassing commercial RuO2 and rivaling state-of-the-art MOFs-based electrocatalysts. Characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior performance of HA-Ni-HHTP is primarily ascribed to changes in semiconductor type, contact angle, and oxygen vacancy content induced by cathodic activation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis using the transmission line model confirms that cathodic activation accelerates charge transport, enhancing the OER process. Furthermore, the cathodic activation strategy holds promise for improving the water oxidation performance of other MOFs such as Fe-HHTP, Co-HHTP, and Cu-HHTP.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen is a fuel of the future that has the potential to replace conventional fossil fuels in several applications. The quickest and most effective method of producing pure hydrogen with no carbon emissions is water electrolysis. Developing highly active electrocatalysts is crucial due to the slow kinetics of oxygen and hydrogen evolution, which limit the usage of precious metals in water splitting. Interfacial engineering of heterostructures has sparked widespread interest in improving charge transfer efficiency and optimizing adsorption/desorption energetics. The emergence of a built&#8208;in&#8208;electric field between RuO 2 and MgFe&#8208;LDH improves the catalytic efficiency toward water splitting reaction. However, LDH&#8208;based materials suffer from poor conductivity, necessitating the design of 1D materials by integration of RuO 2 / MgFe&#8208;LDH to enhance catalytic properties through large surface areas and high electronic conductivity. Experimental results demonstrate lower overpotentials (273 and 122 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and remarkable stability (60 h) for the RuO 2 /MgFe&#8208;LDH/Fiber heterostructure in OER (1 m KOH) and HER (0.5 m H 2 SO 4 ) reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) unveils a synergistic mechanism at the RuO 2 /MgFe&#8208;LDH interface, leading to enhanced catalytic activity in OER and improved adsorption energy for hydrogen atoms, thereby facilitating HER catalysis.</description>

                Abstract Since 2020, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as robust catalysts for the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), benefiting from their distinct advantages. However, the current efficiency of H 2 O 2 production and solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency (SCC) remain suboptimal due to various constraints in the reaction mechanism. Therefore, there is an imperative to propose efficiency improvement strategies to accelerate the development of this reaction system. This comprehensive review delineates recent advances, challenges, and strategies in utilizing COFs for photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production. It explores the fundamentals and challenges (e.g., oxygen (O 2 ) mass transfer rate, O 2 adsorption capacity, response to sunlight, electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency, charge transfer efficiency, selectivity, and H 2 O 2 desorption) associated with this process, as well as the advantages, applications, classification, and preparation strategies of COFs for this purpose. Various strategies to enhance the performance of COFs in H 2 O 2 production are highlighted. The review aims to stimulate further advancements in utilizing COFs for photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production and discusses potential prospects, challenges, and application areas in this field.</description>

      <title>Improving the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics in Zn&#8208;Air Battery by Iodide Oxidation Reaction</title>

                Abstract Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered considerable attention as a highly promising contender in the field of energy storage and conversion. Nevertheless, their performance is considerably impeded by the proliferation of dendrites on the Zinc anode and the slow kinetics of the redox reaction on the air cathode. Herein, taking Ag 30% @LaCoO 3 (Ag 30% @LCO) heterojunction catalyst as the cathode, it is demonstrated that adding KI additives to the alkaline electrolyte can not only enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic reaction but also inhibit the formation of zinc anode dendrites, thereby achieving a comprehensive improvement in the performance of ZABs. Under the action of the KI additive, the optimized Ag 30% @LCO catalyst shows a decreased overpotential from 460 to 220 mV at j = 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , while the assembled ZAB shows reduced charging potential (1.8 V), and long cycle stability (180 h). Furthermore, the morphology characterization results indicate a reduction in dendrites on the Zn anode. Both experimental and calculated results indicate that the presence of I &#8722; as a reaction modifier alters the trajectory of the conventional oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in a more thermodynamically favorable pathway. The introduction of KI additives as electrolytes provides a straightforward approach to developing comprehensively improved ZABs.</description>

                We investigated the electrocatalytic properties of Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2, with 4.2&#8208;5.6 atomic % (at%) iridium. The Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 was synthesized by heating Ir/R&#8208;MnO2&#8208;formed via a surfactant&#8208;assisted (SA) method using KMnO4, IrCl3.H2O, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)&#8208;to 400 oC. The Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) was nano&#8208;sized based on scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), 5.6 at% Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) exhibited an overpotential ( of 327 &#177; 5 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. At 10 mA cm&#8208;2 , the Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) catalyzed the OER for 72 h at an of 534 mV. During this time there was a 12 % loss in Mn and 8 % loss in Ir from the structure. An IrO2 catalyst exhibited an initial &#951; of 420 &#177; 7 for the OER, but after 20 h of operation at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 there was a steep rise in potential (&gt;550 mV) and 12% loss in Ir. The enhanced activity and stability of Ir/&#946;&#8208;MnO2 (SA) is attributed to the incorporation of Ir into the MnO2 lattice during synthesis and the formation of nano&#8208;sized particles using the SA method.</description>

                We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11 times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3M MgBr2 (at 0.6V) and up to 4&#8208;5 times higher adsorption capacity with 3M MgCl2 (at 1V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8208;20% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100 cycles of operation.</description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Oxygen-Doped g-C3N4 Mesoporous Nanosheets for Significant Enhancement of Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Performance</title>

                In this work, oxygen-doped g-C3N4 mesoporous nanosheets (O-CNS) were synthesized via a facile recrystallization method with the assistance of H2O2. The crystal phase, chemical composition, morphological structure, optical property, electronic structure and electrochemical property of the prepared O-CNS samples were well investigated. The morphological observation combined with the nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption results demonstrated that the prepared O-CNS samples possessed nanosheet-like morphology with a porous structure. Doping O into g-C3N4 resulted in the augmentation of the specific surface area, which could provide more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. Simultaneously, the visible light absorption capacity of O-CNS samples was boosted owing to the regulation of O doping. The built energy level induced by the O doping could accelerate the migration rate of photoinduced carriers, and the porous structure was most likely to speed up the release of hydrogen during the photocatalytic hydrogen process. Resultantly, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of the optimized oxygen-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets reached up to 2012.9 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1, which was 13.4 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4. Thus, the significantly improved photocatalytic behavior was imputed to the synergistic effect of the porous structure, the increase in active sites, and the enhancement of visible light absorption and charge separation efficiency. Our research highlights that the synergistic effect caused by element doping will make a great contribution to the remarkable improvement in photocatalytic activity, providing a new inspiration for the construction of novel catalysts.</description>

                Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP = polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000 h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits the metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottle neck step in water splitting reaction towards the realization of hydrogen based clean energy production and storage. Transition metal based N4 organics are explored extensively as oxygen electrocatalysts i.e., (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts because of their ease of synthesis, tuneable properties, low cost and high performance with long term stability. Here, vanillic acid functionalized iron phthalocyanine (FeVAPc) was synthesised and characterised. The novel FeVAPc exhibited good thermal stability and was coated on Ni foam for OER studies. The scanning electron microscopy images showed net&#8208;work like surface morphology and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe in +3 oxidation state. The Ni/FeVAPc demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER with overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2 current density in 1.0 M KOH . The designed catalyst exhibited lesser Tafel slope value which is nearer to the benchmark catalyst, IrO2. The proposed catalyst exhibited good stability as phthalocyanines are highly stable and do not undergo decomposition even in strong acidic and basic corrosive media. Integration of FeVAPc onto Ni foam resulted in higher mass activity, lower charge transfer resistance, high active surface area leading to enhanced conductivity and activity.</description>

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis employing non-precious metal electrocatalysts is a promising strategy for achieving sustainable hydrogen production. However, it still suffers from many challenges, including sluggish alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics, insufficient activity and limited lifetime of non-precious metal electrocatalysts for ampere-level-current-density alkaline HER. Here, we report an efficient alkaline HER strategy at industrial-level current density wherein a flexible WS 2 superstructure is designed to serve as the cathode catalyst for AEM water electrolysis. The superstructure features bond-free van der Waals interaction among the low Young&#8217;s modulus nanosheets to ensure excellent mechanical flexibility, as well as a stepped edge defect structure of nanosheets to realize high catalytic activity and a favorable reaction interface micro-environment. The unique flexible WS 2 superstructure can effectively withstand the impact of high-density gas-liquid exchanges and facilitate mass transfer, endowing excellent long-term durability under industrial-scale current density. An AEM electrolyser containing this catalyst at the cathode exhibits a cell voltage of 1.70 V to deliver a constant catalytic current density of 1 A cm &#8722;2 over 1000 h with a negligible decay rate of 9.67 &#956;V h &#8722;1 .</description>

                Refining synthesis strategies for metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-based catalysts to improve their performance and stability in an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a big challenge. In this study, a series of nanostructured electrocatalysts were synthesized through a solvothermal method by growing MOFs and metal&#8211;triazolates (METs) on nickel foam (NF) substrates (named MET-M/NF, M = Fe, Co, Cu), and these electrocatalysts could be used directly as OER self-supporting electrodes. Among these electrocatalysts, MET-Fe/NF exhibited the best OER performance, requiring only an overpotential of 122 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and showing remarkable stability over 15 h. The experimental results uncovered that MET-Fe/NF underwent an in situ structural reconstruction, resulting in the formation of numerous iron/nickel (oxy)hydroxides with high OER activity. Furthermore, in a two-electrode water-splitting setup, MET-Fe/NF only required 1.463 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Highlighting its potential for practical applications. This work provides insight into the design and development of efficient MOF-based OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract The development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoelectrocatalysts is a key requirement for H 2 generation via solar&#8208;assisted water splitting. In this study, we report on an amenable fabrication route to carbon cloth&#8208;supported graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) nanoarchitectures, featuring a modular dispersion of NiO as co&#8208;catalyst. The synergistic interaction between gCN and NiO, along with the tailoring of their size and spatial distribution, yield very attractive OER performances and durability in freshwater splitting, of great significance for practical end&#8208;uses. The potential of gCN electrocatalysts containing ultra&#8208;dispersed, i. e . &#8220;quasi&#8208;atomic&#8221; NiO, exhibiting a higher activity than the ones containing nickel oxide nanoaggregates, is further highlighted by their activity even in real seawater. This work suggests that efficient OER catalysts can be designed through the construction of optimized interfaces between transition metal oxides and carbon nitride, yielding inexpensive and promising noble metal&#8208;free systems for real&#8208;world applications.</description>

      <title>Fabricating Spinel-Type High-Entropy Oxides of (Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr)3O4 for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17143415</link>

                Fabricating efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for water electrocatalysis. Herein, the spinel-type high-entropy oxides of (Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr)3O4 were synthesized through the high-temperature calcination approach. The influences of calcination temperatures on structures and electrochemical properties were investigated. The optimized catalyst of HEO-900 contains the hybrid structure of regular polyhedrons and irregular nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the exposure of electrochemically active sites. It was identified that the abundant high-valence metal species of Ni3+, Co3+, Fe3+, Mn4+, and Cr3+ are formed during the OER process, which is generally regarded as the electrochemically active sites for OER. Because of the synergistic effect of multi-metal active sites, the optimized HEO-900 catalyst indicates excellent OER activity, which needs the overpotential of 366 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, HEO-900 reveals the prominent durability of running for 24 h at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without clear delay. Therefore, this work supplies a promising route for preparing high-performance multi-metal OER electrocatalysts for water electrocatalysis application.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Removal of External Proteins PsbO, PsbP and PsbQ on Flash-Induced Molecular Oxygen Evolution and Its Biphasicity in Tobacco PSII</title>

                The oxygen evolution within photosystem II (PSII) is one of the most enigmatic processes occurring in nature. It is suggested that external proteins surrounding the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) not only stabilize it and provide an appropriate ionic environment but also create water channels, which could be involved in triggering the ingress of water and the removal of O2 and protons outside the system. To investigate the influence of these proteins on the rate of oxygen release and the efficiency of OEC function, we developed a measurement protocol for the direct measurement of the kinetics of oxygen release from PSII using a Joliot-type electrode. PSII-enriched tobacco thylakoids were used in the experiments. The results revealed the existence of slow and fast modes of oxygen evolution. This observation is model-independent and requires no specific assumptions about the initial distribution of the OEC states. The gradual removal of exogenous proteins resulted in a slowdown of the rapid phase (~ms) of O2 release and its gradual disappearance while the slow phase (~tens of ms) accelerated. The role of external proteins in regulating the biphasicity and efficiency of oxygen release is discussed based on observed phenomena and current knowledge.</description>

                The development of a low-cost and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode is of critical importance for water electrolysis technologies. The general approach to achieving a high-efficiency OER electrode is to regulate catalytic material structures by synthetic control.

                Introduction: The development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts plays a pivotal role in the realization of hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. Method: In this study, two-dimensional NiCo2S4 nanosheets weresynthesized usinga hydrothermal method followed by a sulfidation process. Results: The resulting materials were thoroughly characterized to understand their morphology and structure. The findings indicate that the NiCo2S4 nanosheets exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity and a high density of pores, which facilitate electrolyte infiltration and interfacial charge transfer during electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, the incorporation of S2&#8722; modulates the electronic structure of metal ions, reducing the oxidation potential of metal sites and promoting the surface reconstruction of the electrode to form active species. Electrochemical tests conducted in a 1 M KOH solution using the synthesized catalyst as the working electrode demonstrate an overpotential of merely 280 mV and 300 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 40 mA cm&#8722;2 , respectively, which are much lower than those of NiCo-LDH electrodes (360 mV and 410 mV). Conclusion: Furthermore, the NiCo2S4 electrode delivers a remarkably low Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec&#8722;1 . This investigation presents a novel approach to the development of efficient transition metal-based electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The performance of MoOx based devices is highly influenced by the presence of oxygen vacancies and the trap density at the oxide-semiconductor interface. This paper presents a detailed investigation of the surface states present at the MoOx/c-Si interface through capacitance and conductance methods. Thin films of MoOx were deposited on n-Si using DC reactive sputtering of Mo under varying oxygen flow rates and studied the modulation of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) device parameters using appropriate analysis methods. The capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis reveals the formation of nearly dielectric films at an intermediate oxygen flow rate of 15 sccm, exhibiting a dielectric constant of 24 and negative fixed charges of approximately 1.81x1012 cm-2. Work function evaluated from the Kelvin probe measurements was found to be maximum of 5.08 eV for the films deposited at the intermediate oxygen flow rate of 15 sccm. Furthermore, admittance analysis was performed on all the films to determine the loss mechanism in different regions, ranging from inversion to accumulation. Parallel conductance for different bias conditions was studied and observed the domination of oxide traps at the higher oxygen flow (&gt; 20 sccm). Investigation of deep level defects were performed using the deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) in the temperature range of 100 K to 475 K, along with the C-V measurements. A transition in C-V behavior was observed below room temperature that shows the minority carrier response time is controlled by generation-recombination at low temperatures and by diffusion at high temperatures. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed that the films are sub-stoichiometric with the dominant oxidation state of Mo+6. The results have been discussed and presented in detail.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Currently, a large number of studies on alkaline water electrolysis are being carried out with the aim of reducing the specific energy costs for the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. This work is devoted to the methods of synthesis of highly dispersed composite coating on the surface of nickel foam and the methods of the formation of bi- and ternary catalytic alloys based on molybdenum using electrochemical deposition. During the study of the samples morphological and element-by-element analyses were carried out and the activity indicators of the synthesized highly effective catalytic coatings were obtained.</description>

      <title>Facile Carbothermal Synthesis of Metal Phosphides-Based Multifunctional Electrocatalysts via Polyaniline Doped with Phosphoric Acid</title>

                Abstract Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and their composites are promising non-platinum electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. But traditional methods to obtain these electrocatalysts are usually multi-step and include the participation of hazardous phosphorus compounds during phosphidation. Here, the possibility of using a polyaniline doped with phosphoric acid (PANI&#8729;H3PO4) &#8211; as a source of C, N and P simultaneously - to obtain composites based on N,P-doped carbon and nano- and/or submicron TMP particles as HER, OER and ORR electrocatalysts is demonstrated. The pyrolysis of PANI&#8729;H3PO4 together with Co, Ni, Mo, or Fe salt allows the formation of such composite electrocatalysts by the carbon thermal reduction route. Regardless of the pH of the electrolyte, the MoP-based electrocatalyst is characterized in HER by the smallest Tafel slope and overpotential of hydrogen evolution and also exhibits high stability during long-term operation. At the same time, other composites are multifunctional electrocatalysts possessing activity not only in HER, but also in OER and ORR. The proposed approach can be a starting point for a simple, universal in choice of d-metal, and environmentally attractive preparation of multifunctional TMP-based electrocatalysts with further improvement of their performance.</description>

      <title>Stimulating Electron Delocalization of Lanthanide Elements through High-Entropy Confinement to Promote Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c04176</link>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have aroused extensive attention in the field of catalysis. However, due to the integration of multiple active sites in HEA, it exhibits excessive adsorption behavior resulting in difficult desorption of active species from the catalyst surfaces, which hinders the catalytic efficiency. Therefore, adjusting the adsorption strength of the active site in HEA to enhance the catalytic activity is of great importance. By introducing rare-earth (RE) elements into the high-entropy alloy, the delocalization of 4f electrons can be achieved through the interaction between the multimetal active site and RE, which benefits to regulate the adsorption strength of the HEA surface. Herein, the RE Ce-modified hexagonal-close-packed PtRuFeCoNiZn-Ce/C HEAs are synthesized and showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with ultralow overpotentials of 4, 7 and 156, 132 mV, respectively, to reach 10 mA cm</description>

      <title>Single Atom Catalysts Based on Earth-Abundant Metals for Energy-Related Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.4c00155</link>
      <description>&#352;t&#283;p&#225;n Kment, Aristides Bakandritsos, Iosif Tantis, Hana Kmentov&#225;, Yunpeng Zuo, Olivier Henrotte, Alberto Naldoni, Michal Otyepka, Rajender S. Varma, Radek Zbo&#345;il, Chemical reviews. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400354685

                Anthropogenic activities related to population growth, economic development, technological advances, and changes in lifestyle and climate patterns result in a continuous increase in energy consumption. At the same time, the rare metal elements frequently deployed as catalysts in energy related processes are not only costly in view of their low natural abundance, but their availability is often further limited due to geopolitical reasons. Thus, electrochemical energy storage and conversion with earth-abundant metals, mainly in the form of single-atom catalysts (SACs), are highly relevant and timely technologies. In this review the application of earth-abundant SACs in electrochemical energy storage and electrocatalytic conversion of chemicals to fuels or products with high energy content is discussed. The oxygen reduction reaction is also appraised, which is primarily harnessed in fuel cell technologies and metal-air batteries. The coordination, active sites, and mechanistic aspects of transition metal SACs are analyzed for two-electron and four-electron reaction pathways. Further, the electrochemical water splitting with SACs toward green hydrogen fuel is discussed in terms of not only hydrogen evolution reaction but also oxygen evolution reaction. Similarly, the production of ammonia as a clean fuel via electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction is portrayed, highlighting the potential of earth-abundant single metal species.</description>

      <title>The g-C3N4/CdO Heterojunction as an Efficient Photo-electron Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physb.2024.416269</link>

                The electronic, optical, and photo-electro catalytic properties of the g-C3N4/CdO(CGN/CdO) heterojunction are studied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The CGN/CdO heterojunction has a staggered band structure and indirect bandgap (1.976 eV), following the S-scheme mechanism. The absorption spectra of the heterojunction are substantially red-shifted and the absorption coefficients are significantly higher relative to the intrinsic g-C3N4(GCN) and intrinsic CdO. In addition, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 14.21 %. The photo-catalytic water decomposition can occur at pH = 0&#8211;14. The &#951;STH of the GCN/CdO heterojunction is up to 31.82 %, and it is modulated to 36.14 % under &#8722;4 % biaxial strain modulation. The low over-potential of the Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the heterojunction is 0.905 V obtained at the GCN layer, and that of the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is &#8722;0.498 V occurred at the CdO layer. These findings suggest that the GCN/CdO heterojunction has an efficient photo-electro catalytic potential for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Electroless plating of Co P O electrocatalyst on carbon cloth for alkaline water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118491</link>

                We report the simple method of fabrication, self-supported nanostructure of CoPO nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon cloth scaffold by electroless plating. CoPO demonstrates exceptional bi-functional catalytic performance in water electrolysis, efficiently producing hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) gases simultaneously due to optimized adsorption energy for intermediates and the excellent conductivity of Cobalt-metallic nanoparticles. CoPO achieves a geometric current of 10 mA/cm2 with 190 mV and 280 mV overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, while its continuous catalytic nanoparticle coating on the carbon cloth scaffold ensures superior charge transport with minimal resistance. It is highly encouraging to observe that the HER and OER performance of CoPO electrodes far surpasses that of carbon cloth, approaching the benchmark set by noble electrocatalysts Pt/C and RuO2. The alkaline electrolyser based on the two-electrode cell using CoPO electrodes demonstrates bi-functional water splitting at 1.64 V and 1.98 V at 10 and 100 mA/cm2. Furthermore, the alkaline electrolyser exhibits stable electrocatalytic activity for about more than 16 h at the current density of 50 mA/cm2.</description>

                As a typical VOCs emitted from petrochemical industry, chlorobenzene was selected to study its removal by wet oxidation with electrochemical catalysis. Ti based IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode was used in the advanced oxidation of chlorobenzene, and Sn, Sb, Pt and La were used to modify Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5. Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-La showed the highest removal rate of chlorobenzene and it reached 99.2% for the chlorobenzene oxidation, which was 20% higher than those of the other 3 additions. Oxygen evolution overpotential of Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5-La increased to 1.17 V when compared with Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 of 1.08 V. EPR tests for free radicals and GC-MS tests for intermediates showed that the main active substance was &#183;OH, and the element Cl in chlorobenzene dissociated from the benzene ring under the action with &#183;OH to form &#183;Cl and ClO&#183; radicals. Degradation pathway of chlorobenzene was figured out as chlorobenzene&#8594; phenols&#8594; organic acids&#8594; CO2+H2O.</description>

      <title>NiMoO4 containing O-vacancy cooperated with bimetallic sulfides as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting</title>

                MoS2 is a potential transition metal sulfide (TMS) with excellent performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. However, MoS2 has poor stability owing to its metastable properties and therefore is easily oxidized to MoO3 which can hinder the HER process. In this work, MoO3 on the surface of the TMS is transformed to NiMoO4 with plentiful oxygen vacancies (Ov) favorable for HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by an acid treatment to form an Ov-containing transition bimetallic sulfide/oxide catalyst (Ov-NiMoO4@Ni3S2-MoS2-rGO-NF, denoted as NiMoO4@NiMoS-rN). The electrocatalyst shows exceptional performance for HER and OER in terms of increased intrinsic activity, electron transfer efficiency, reaction kinetics and durability on account of the Ov, synergistic effect among different phases and bimetallic active sites. The overpotentials of NiMoO4@NiMoS-rN electrode when achieving 10 mA cm-2 are 45 mV and 195 mV towards HER and OER in alkaline, respectively, and the performance holds nearly unchanged during a 50-hour stability test. When assembled to a two-electrode system, the current density of 10 mA cm-2 can keep steady for 50 h without degradation. The strategy combined by phase transition, interface and defect engineering via a facile method provides a practical idea for design and modulation of bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                Metal&#8211;organic frameworks have garnered attention as highly efficient pre-electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Current structure&#8211;activity relationships primarily rely on the assumption that the complete dissolution of organic ligands occurs during electrocatalysis. Herein, modeling based on NiFe Prussian blue analogs (NiFe-PBAs) show that cyanide ligands leach from the matrix and subsequently oxidize to corresponding inorganic ions (ammonium and carbonate) that re-adsorb onto the surface of NiFe OOH during the OER process. Interestingly, the surface-adsorbed inorganic ions induce the OER reaction of NiFe OOH to switch from the adsorbate evolution to the lattice-oxygen&#8211;mediated mechanism, thus contributing to the high activity. In addition, this reconstructed inorganic ion layer acting as a versatile protective layer can prevent the dissolution of metal sites to maintain contact between catalytic sites and reactive ions, thus breaking the activity&#8211;stability trade-off. Consequently, our constructed NiFe-PBAs exhibit excellent durability for 1250 h with an ultralow overpotential of 253 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. The scale-up NiFe-PBAs operated with a low energy consumption of &#8764;4.18 kWh m&#8722;3 H2 in industrial water electrolysis equipment. The economic analysis of the entire life cycle demonstrates that this green hydrogen production is priced at US$2.59/kgH2, meeting global targets (&lt;US$2.5/kgH2).</description>

      <title>Rapid Charge Extraction via Hole Transfer Layer and Interfacial Coordination Bonds on Hematite Photoanode for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

                Enhancing carrier separation and transport efficiency to achieve efficient water oxidation reaction is an important issue in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting field, and introducing hole transfer layer (HTL) is an effective strategy to improve it. However, the difficulty of charge transfer between HTL and oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is a problem unresolved. To ameliorate the situation, we choose CoOOH as HTL and the metal&#8211;organic coordination compound constructed by 4,5-Imidazoledicarboxylic acid (IA) and Co/Ni ions as OEC. Using the interfacial coordination bonds as carrier transfer channels, the holes were rapidly extracted from HTL to OEC containing abundant active sites and participate in oxidation reaction. In consequence, the unique design results in a photocurrent density of 2.97 times that of &#945;-Fe2O3 at 1.23 VRHE for the IACN/CoOOH/Fe2O3. This study reveals how the advisable design of photoanode promotes interfacial charge transfer and provides a valuable reference for the design of composite photoanode.</description>

      <title>CoMoP Hole Transfer Layer Functionally Enhances Efficiency and Stability of BiVO4 Based Photoanode for Solar Water Splitting</title>

                Engineering the hole transfer layer is a promising approach to suppress the bulk charge recombination of photoanodes for enhancing solar water splitting performance. Herein, functional cobalt-molybdenum bimetallic phosphide (CoMoP) layer are inserted between bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and NiFeOx oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) as hole transfer layer to construct an integrated photoanode (NiFeOx/CoMoP/BiVO4). This state-of-the-art NiFeOx/CoMoP/BiVO4 photoanode not only achieves a superior photocurrent density of 5.82 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), but also an outstanding 60 hours long-term photostability (100 mW/cm2). Such excellent PEC performance can be attributed to the engineering CoMoP hole layer in NiFeOx/BiVO4, promoting hole transfer, retarding bulk charge recombination and accelerating the surface water oxidation kinetics. This study contributes to the role of the hole transfer layer and sheds light on the development of effective and stable photoanodes for PEC water splitting.</description>

                Abstract NiFe&#8208;based hydroxides are well&#8208;established as efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline purified water. However, they usually degrade rapidly in seawater electrolysis because of concentrated Cl &#8722; anions in seawater. In this work, a facile approach utilizing an ultrafast dipping method is presented to fabricate durable and scalable NiFe hydroxides, enhanced by interfacial akagan&#233;ite FeOOH for seawater splitting. This study reveals significantly improved electrocatalytic stability of NiFe hydroxides at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 for 100 h in alkaline seawater. It is realized by the formed FeOOH in a specific akagan&#233;ite phase whose lattice tunnels are well filled by intrinsic Cl &#8722; anions, that serve to electrostatically repel corrosive chlorides in electrolyte. This anionic design also provides superior corrosion protection for other active metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts when deployed in alkaline purified water and allows for facile scaling up of the anode, facilitating the practical utilization for seawater electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity on transition metal (TM) catalysts is governed by OER mechanism, yet discovering a controllable parameter to custom&#8208;tailor OER mechanism remains a challenge. Here, the study highlights an e g electron&#8208;filling state in octahedral TM&#8208;catalysts, achieved by the modulation of splitting energy (&#916;) via different anions (R) (Cl &#8722; , PO 4 3&#8722; , NO 3 &#8722; , F &#8722; , SO 4 2&#8722; , CO 3 2&#8722; ). The e g &#8208; electron filling state customization predominantly arises from the adjustment of Co&#8208; d z 2 orbital energy, which can tailor the bandgap between Co&#8208; d z 2 and O&#8208; p orbits (&#916;&#949; d&#8208;p ), thus customizing lattice&#8208;oxygen (O L ) activities and the OER mechanism. Combining the experimental measurements with DFT calculations, it is concluded that increased e g electron in TM&#8208;catalysts brings decreased &#916;&#949; d&#8208;p , which can manageably strengthen lattice&#8208;oxygen reactivity. Consequently, the OER mechanism on TM catalyst is transformed from adsorbate precipitation mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) and customized OER pathways with different lattice&#8208;oxygen activities. The screened PO 4 3&#8208;_ TM, with the optimal O L activity in LOM path, possesses excellent activity and stability, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at 236 mV overpotential and maintaining stable operation for 300 h with inapparent degradation at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 .</description>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key reactions in numerous renewable energy devices. Unlike conventional powdered catalysts, self-supported catalysts are extensively employed in oxygen electrocatalysis because of the enhanced electron-transfer rate, high specific surface area, and superior mechanical flexibility. Among the self-supported conductive substrates, carbon fiber usually exhibits several distinctive advantages, such as a straightforward preparation process, relatively low cost, good stability, and excellent conductivity. Against this background, carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts have been widely applied and studied in oxygen electrocatalysis, indicating a promising development direction in oxygen electrocatalyst research. Thus, it is essential to offer an overall summary of the research progress in this field to facilitate its subsequent development. Taking the regulatory mechanisms and modification methods as a starting point, this review comprehensively summarizes recent research on carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts in recent years. Firstly, a brief overview of the synthesis methods and regulatory mechanisms of carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts is given. Furthermore, the view also highlights the modification methods and research progress of self-supported electrocatalysts synthesized on carbon fiber-based substrates in recent years in terms of different dopant atoms. Finally, the prospects for the application of self-supported electrocatalysts based on carbon fiber in oxygen electrocatalysis and the possible future directions of their development are presented. This review summarizes recent developments and applications of self-supported bi-functional electrocatalysts with carbon fiber-based materials as the conducting substrate in oxygen electrocatalysis. It also lays a robust scientific foundation for the subsequent reasonable design of highly effective carbon fiber-based self-supported electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Electrolysis of water for producing hydrogen is an effective and sustainable technique to meet the continuously increasing energy demand. Nevertheless, its advancement is impeded by the inadequate catalytic efficacy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Vacancy defect engineering is a rational approach to simultaneously enhance the catalytic performance for both the half-reactions. However, controlling the vacancy defects is quite challenging. Here, we have employed a radio-frequency Ar plasma-assisted treatment strategy to prepare highly efficient graphene-supported FeNi 2 S 4 bifunctional catalysts with abundant vacancies. The plasma treatment induces the formation of vacancy structures in the catalyst, modifying the free energy of reaction intermediates, surface morphology, and electronic structure as well as reducing the reaction barriers, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. The optimized graphene-supported FeNi 2 S 4 catalyst possesses abundant sulfur vacancies, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance. At 50 mA cm -2 , the overpotentials for OER and HER are 240 and 256 mV, respectively, indicating exceptional stability. Overall, this work offers valuable insights into the development of cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Developing Catalysts for Membrane Electrode Assemblies in High Performance Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>

                Extensive research is underway to achieve carbon neutrality through the production of green hydrogen via water electrolysis, powered by renewable energy. Polymer membrane water electrolyzers, such as proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE), are at the forefront of this research. Developing highly active and durable electrode catalysts is very important for commercializing these electrolyzers. However, most research is conducted in half&#8208;cell setups, which may not fully represent the catalysts' effectiveness in membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly (MEA) devices. This review explores the catalysts developed for high&#8208;performance PEMWE and AEMWE MEA systems. Only the catalysts reporting the MEA performance were discussed in this review. In PEMWE, strategies aim to minimize Ir use for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by maximizing activity, employing metal oxide&#8208;based supports, integrating secondary elements into IrOx lattices, or exploring non&#8208;Ir materials. For AEMWE, the emphasis is on enhancing the performance of NiFe&#8208;based and Co&#8208;based catalysts by improving electrical conductivity and mass transport. Pt&#8208;based and Ni&#8208;based catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in AEMWE are also examined. Additionally, this review discusses the unique considerations for catalysts operating in pure water within AEMWE systems.</description>

                The rational design of cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts becomes the crucial energy storage technology to boost the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which hinders the large-scale application of metal-air batteries under the situation of increasingly pressing energy anxiety. Herein, the Co-based ZIF introduced the moderate amount of Cu2+-derived Cu/Co metal nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in carbon frameworks after high-temperature calcination. The Co-O bond on the surface of Co nanoparticles is modulated by adjacent Cu nanoparticles with the surface Cu-O bonds. The resulted increase of the Co2+/Co3+ ratio in 0.1CuCo-NC enhances the ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic kinetics along with the &#916;E of 0.639 V. In situ Raman spectra of the catalyst on the three-electrode system as well as in the driven zinc-air battery (ZAB) show that the Co-O active sites regulated by Cu nanoparticles with Cu-O bonds maintain a periodic lattice expansion and compression during discharging and charging. The zinc-air battery based on 0.1CuCo-NC has a peak power density of up to 198.3 mW cm&#8211;2, a mass-specific capacity of 798.2 mAh g&#8211;1, and a cycling stability of 923 h at room temperature. This work makes up the research gap of a Co-based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-derived catalyst regulated by a transition metal.</description>

                Abstract Designing integrated overall water&#8208;splitting catalysts that maintain high efficiency and stability under various conditions is an important trend for future development, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, novel nanoflower&#8208;like tri&#8208;metallic Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo phosphide catalyst ((Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo)P@F&#8208;CDs), integrated with F&#8208;doped carbon dots (F&#8208;CDs), were synthesized via a straightforward hydrothermal process and subsequent phosphatization. Attributable to precise interface engineering and electronic structure optimization, (Ni&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo)P@F&#8208;CDs exhibit exceptional bi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in alkaline conditions, achieving remarkably low overpotentials of 231 and 123 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, at a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Industrially, only 1.426 V is needed for the same efficacy. Additionally, the catalyst requires merely 1.508 and 1.564 V for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH and simulated seawater, respectively, at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . The catalyst also shows excellent stability, with minimal performance decline over 100 h within 100&#8211;200 mA cm &#8722;2 . Density functional theory calculations indicate that the interface structure synergistically optimizes Gibbs free energy for H* and O* intermediates during HER and OER, respectively, accelerating electrochemical water&#8208;splitting kinetics.</description>

      <title>Atomic Cobalt Metal Centers with Asymmetric N/B&#8208;Coordination for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202408111</link>
      <description>Guangjian Guan, Yuhang Liu, Fuhua Li, Xiaojin Shi, Lingyue Liu, Tianyu Wang, Xue&#8208;Ting Xu, Ming Zhao, Jie Ding, Hong Bin Yang, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400378202

                Abstract Cobalt single atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited promising performance in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), positioning them as potential dual&#8208;functional catalysts for Zn&#8208;air battery. However, the long&#8208;standing challenge lies in achieving satisfactory dual&#8208;functionality and stability of these SACs. In this study, to optimize the 4e &#8210; ORR performance, boron (B) atoms are employed with low electronegativity to regulate the structure of the Co&#8211;N&#8211;C catalytic center. This resulted in the formation of an asymmetrically coordinated Co metal center catalyst (Co&#8208;N 3 B). Compared to the Co&#8208;N 4 , Co&#8208;N 3 B exhibited lower free energy for ORR and stronger adsorption energy toward * O species, effectively suppressing the 2e &#8210; ORR pathway at the cobalt site and preventing catalyst corrosion induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in ORR reactions, thereby enhancing catalyst stability. In situ attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) further validated excellent interaction between Co active centers and O intermediates. Furthermore, the self&#8208;made rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrated remarkable discharge peak power density (&#8776;253 mW cm &#8210;2 ), energy density (&#8776;819 mAh g &#8210;1 ), and cyclic stability exceeding 110 h. This study provides new insights into constructing catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and offers strong references for practical applications in energy storage and convension electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity Enables New Breakthrough in Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Reactions</title>

                To facilitate the transition from a carbon-energy-dependent society to a sustainable society, conventional engineering strategies, which encounter limitations associated with intrinsic material properties, should undergo the paradigm shift. From a theoretical viewpoint, the spin-dependent feature of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveals the potential of a spin-polarization strategy in enhancing the performance of electrochemical (EC) reactions. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon attracts unprecedented attention owing to its potential utility in achieving novel breakthroughs. This paper starts with the experimental results aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the spin-dependent OER focusing on the EC system based on the CISS phenomenon. The applicability of spin-polarization to EC system is verified through various analytical methodologies to clarify the theoretical groundwork and mechanisms underlying the spin-dependent reaction pathway. The discussion is then extended to effective spin-control strategies in photoelectrochemical system based on the CISS effect. Exploring the influence of spin-state control on the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects, this perspective also discusses the effect of spin polarization induced by the CISS phenomenon on spin-dependent OER. Lastly, future directions for enhancing the performance of spin-dependent redox systems are discussed, including expansion to various chemical reactions and the development of materials with spin-control capabilities.</description>

                Complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to achieve with traditional manufacturing techniques can be created through 3D printing today. This method can lead to improved performance and novel designs for gas diffusion electrode (GDE) substrates. In this study, GDE samples are prepared by the 3D printing method and subjected to Pt coating with varying thicknesses using the electron beam evaporation (E-beam) method. GDE samples are denoted BM-C0 (bare), BM-C1 (0.20 &#956;m Cr + 0.20 &#956;m Pt), and BM-C2 (0.20 &#956;m Cr + 0.45 &#956;m Pt). After the coating process, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of the GDEs is examined in 0.5 M H2SO4. The maximum current density value is obtained as 77.86 mA/cm2 at 1.7 V from the BM-C2 sample. A change in the charge transfer coefficient has been determined in the Tafel curves, resulting from the partial oxidation of Pt. It is determined that the best charge-transfer rate at the electrode/electrolyte interface belongs to the BM-C2 electrode among the GDE samples. According to LSV results, it is revealed that the electrochemical performance of the BM-C2 sample is 14.01 times more improved compared to other GDEs. Furthermore, it is anticipated that a Pt-coated thin film could significantly enhance the performance of GDEs to achieve a competitive performance level in energy conversion devices.</description>

                ABSTRACT The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a bottleneck for electrocatalytic water splitting due to its sluggish kinetics and, thus, high overpotentials. This limits water electrolysis as a key technology for the generation of hydrogen as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. For alkaline water splitting, perovskite phases (ABO 3 ) with earth&#8208;abundant first&#8208;row transition&#8208;metals have emerged as a promising material class for OER electrocatalysts. Among these, LaNiO 3 has been found to exhibit high intrinsic OER activity. To increase catalyst utilization, a high surface area of the catalyst is desirable and can be achieved by impregnation of porous templates. In this work, La&#8211;Ni&#8208;based oxides were prepared via impregnation of activated carbon and subsequent heating, combining precursor calcination and template removal into one step. The phase structure of the samples is analyzed via powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry, and the morphology is determined by scanning electron microscopy. The synergistic effect of B&#8208;site mixing iron as well as A&#8208;site mixing strontium into LaNiO 3 is studied and found to increase its OER activity, confirming the activity&#8208;enhancing effect of Fe in Ni&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. To allow for facile technical application of the catalysts, the electrodes are prepared by coating a perovskite ink onto Ni&#8208;metal as industrially relevant substrates, followed by calcination.</description>

                Water electrolysis is increasingly considered a viable solution for meeting the world&#8217;s growing energy demands and mitigating environmental issues. An inventive strategy to mitigate the energy requirements involves substituting the energy&#8208;intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with biomass&#8208;derived glycerol electrooxidation. Nonetheless, the synthesis of electrocatalysts for controlling the selectivity towards added&#8208;value chemicals at the anode and efficient H2 generation at the cathode remains a critical bottleneck. Herein, we implemented a galvanostatic electroshock synthesis approach to control the reduction kinetics of Au(III) and Pt(IV) to grow ultra&#8208;low amount of gold&#8208;platinum alloys on a gas diffusion electrode (12&#8208;26 &#181;gmetal cm&#8210;2) for glycerol&#8208;fed hydroxide anion exchange membrane based electrolyzer. The symmetric GDE&#8208;Au100&#8208;xPtx||GDE&#8208;Au100&#8208;xPtx systems showed a notable improvement in electrolyzer performance (GDE&#8208;Au64Pt36 = 201 mA cm&#8722;2) as compared to monometallic versions (GDE&#8208;Au100Pt0 = 18 mA cm&#8722;2, GDE&#8208;Au0Pt100 = 81 mA cm&#8722;2). Chromatography (HPLC) analysis underscores the critical importance of bulk electrolysis methodology (galvanostatic vs potentiostatic) for the efficient conversion of glycerol into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Regarding the electrical energy required to produce 1 kg of H2 for such an electrolyzer fed at the anode with glycerol, our results confirm a drastic decrease by a factor of at least two compared with conventional water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Lattice Distortion Promotes Carrier Separation to Improve the Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Performance of Bismuth Vanadate Photoanode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202410548</link>
      <description>Kaige Tian, Lujie Jin, Asif Mahmood, Hua Yang, Pengfei An, Jing Zhang, Yujin Ji, Youyong Li, Li Deng, Junqing Yan, Junqing Yan, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400497697

                Abstract The poor carrier separation capability and sluggish water oxidation reaction kinetics are two critical factors that impact the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of the bismuth vanadate (BiVO 4 ) photoanode. Previous studies have demonstrated that doping with rare&#8208;earth elements to induce lattice distortions and loading oxygen evolution reaction (OER) co&#8208;catalysts are effective strategies for enhancing carrier separation capabilities and accelerating the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction. Herein, Cu 2+ &#8208;doped RuO 2 (Cu&#8208;RuO 2 ) particles are anchored onto rare earth element Thulium (Tm)&#8208;doped BiVO 4 (Tm&#8208;BiVO 4 ) photoanode substrates, constructing an integrated Cu&#8208;RuO 2 &#8208;Tm&#8208;BiVO 4 photoanode. The newly integrated photoanode not only achieves a photocurrent density of 5.3 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), but also exhibits exceptional stability. A series of detailed physical and chemical characterizations as well as density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that Tm doping induces lattice distortion in BiVO 4 , enhancing the internal electric field and thereby facilitating carrier separation. Moreover, the anchored Cu&#8208;RuO 2 particles not only lattice&#8208;match with the Tm&#8208;BiVO 4 photoanode, reducing interfacial transfer resistance, but also expedite the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction. The profound significance of this work is that it offers a reference for the future design and fabrication of novel integrated photoanodes.</description>

                Surface area, pore properties, synergistic behavior, homogenous dispersion, and interactions between carbon matrix and metal&#8208;nanostructures are the key factors for achieving the better performance of carbon&#8208;metal based (electro)catalysts. However, the traditional hydro&#8208; or solvothermal preparation of (electro)catalysts, particularly, bi&#8208; or tri&#8208;metallic nanostructures anchored graphene (G) or carbon nanotubes (CNTs), often pose to poor metal&#8211;support interaction, low synergism, and patchy dispersion. At first, bimetallic flower&#8208;like&#8208;CuFeS 2 /NG and cube&#8208;like&#8208;NiFeS 2 /NCNTs nanocomposites were prepared by solvothermal method. The resultant bimetallic nanocomposites were employed to derive the 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW (electro)catalyst by a very simple and green urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method. The desired physicochemical properties of Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW such as multiple active sites, strong metal&#8208;support interaction, homogenous dispersion and enhanced surface area were confirmed by various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method for preparing 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;based (electro)catalysts. The Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW was found to be highly effective for alkaline&#8208;mediated oxygen evolution reaction at low onset potential of 284.24 mV, and the stable current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH for 10 h. Further, the Fe 2 CuNiS 4 /NGCNTs&#8208;SW demonstrated excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol with good k app value of 87.71 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 s &#8722;1 and excellent reusability over five cycles. Overall, the developed urea&#8208;mediated &#8220;mix&#8208;heat&#8221; method is highly efficient for the preparation of metal&#8208;nanoarchitectures anchored 2D&#8208;nano&#8208;sandwiched (electro)catalysts with high synergism, uniform dispersion and excellent metal&#8208;support interaction.</description>

      <title>Dissolved oxygen affinities of hundreds of benthic foraminiferal species</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marmicro.2024.102380</link>

                Over the past decades, fossil assemblages of benthic foraminifera have been used to reconstruct the variability of oxygen-depleted areas, including oxygen minimum zones. These areas currently represent almost a tenth of the global oceans' surface area, and further expansion is expected due to global warming; with major impacts on marine ecosystems, biodiversity, and fisheries. To predict their future evolution, accurate estimates and quantification of past oceanic oxygenation are needed, and thus consistent calibration of the O2 estimation transfer functions is required. Here, we combine the BENFEP database that compiles all the benthic foraminiferal census data published for the East Pacific Ocean, with dissolved oxygen data interpolated from the WOA18 and GLODAPV2.2022 databases, to describe the oxygen affinities of the 1526 benthic foraminiferal taxa from the BENFEP database among 1691 samples. The affinities of the most common 202 species of the database are detailed here. For each of these taxa, the range of oxygen concentration, average O2 value where the species is usually found, and O2 value associated with its peak in relative abundance are listed and used to assign each taxon to the oxygen categories anoxic, dysoxic, suboxic, low oxic, and high oxic. Finally, using the relative abundance of each of these five oxygen assemblages and their associated taxa, transfer function indices of dissolved oxygen estimation were refined. The new BFAex extends the range of applicability of the formerly published BFA index, here updated using all the available samples BFAup and extended from 0.04 to 2.58 mL L&#8722;1 to 0.02&#8211;6.62 mL L&#8722;1.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Modules for Synergistic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Generation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Retention in Closed-Circuit Escape Respirators</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1301/1/012044</link>
      <description>Adam Swanger, Raymond H. Fernando, Colin Mahony, R. N. Carro, A. W. Harrison, IOP conference series. Materials science and engineering. 1301(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400360221

                Abstract Since 2018, NASA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have been developing a liquid oxygen storage module (LOXSM) based on the NASA patent-pending Cryogenic Flux Capacitor (CFC) technology. LOXSM&#8217;s could potentially replace the gaseous or chemical-based oxygen supply in current closed-circuit escape respirators (CCER), with reducing CCER size being a primary goal. By virtue of the CFC functionality, cryogenic oxygen stored within the LOXSM is released in response to heat input, ideally from the breathing loop. Prior efforts focused on the oxygen storage potential of silica aerogel materials that the CFC utilizes, and were previously reported. Current work explored the LOXSM&#8217;s potential to remove and retain CO 2 produced by the CCER user, in conjunction with oxygen generation, creating a synergy that may be exploited to reduce or eliminate the chemical CO 2 absorber used in current CCERs. A test program for determining CO 2 retention is presented, as well as the evolution of LOXSM prototypes. Testing showed that it is possible to completely remove CO 2 out of an effluent stream at the flowrate required for the capacity of the CCER for an appreciable time, and that the LOXSM prototype design progression had a positive effect on that duration.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of Local Field Distortion-Induced Dual Electron-Trapping Centers for Efficient Photocatalytic Fuel Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124370</link>

                Active electron-trapping centers play significant roles in photocatalysis. Herein, we synergize local field distortion and defects in nanocrystals to produce dual electron-trapping centers and unravel the nature of aluminum doping in porous ZnO with tunable amounts of heteroatoms and oxygen vacancies. The introduced Al atoms in the structural domain induce local field distortion and trigger the movement of Zn2+ from a singlet low spin state to a stable triplet state, resulting in the generation of free carriers trapping centers and optimized electronic energy band structure. Dual active electron-trapping centers of heteroatoms and oxygen vacancies promote the Separation of photo-generated charge carriers and reduce the adsorption energies of H* species. Furthermore, the d-band center of Al-doped ZnO with oxygen vacancies shifts to a higher energy position, thus promoting the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen intermediates and exhibiting 4-fold the photocatalytic H2 efficiency of pristine ZnO. This study provides new insights into the rational design of highly efficient oxide-based photocatalysts toward sustainable solar fuel evolution.</description>

      <title>Molecular Formation in Low-Metallicity Hot Cores</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/universe10070290</link>
      <description>Yara Sobhy, Hideko Nomura, Tetsuo Yamamoto, Osama M. Shalabeia, Universe. 10(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400321448

                The chemical complexity in low-metallicity hot cores has been confirmed by observations. We investigate the effect of varying physical parameters, such as temperature, density and the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR), on the molecular abundance evolution in low-metallicity hot cores using the UMIST gas phase chemical model. CRIR had the strongest effect on molecular abundance. The resultant molecular abundances were divided into three categories with different trends in time evolution. We compared our results with the observations of hot cores in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our model fits best with the observations at a time of around $10^5$ years after the evaporation of ice and at the CRIR of $1.36 \times 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. The resultant abundances of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs), such as CH$_3$OH, HCOOCH$_3$ and CH$_3$OCH$_3$, do not fit with observations in the same physical condition and may be located in a different physical environment. Our results suggest that investigating the CRIR value is crucial to predict the molecular evolution in LMC hot cores.</description>

      <title>Direct Observations of Magnetic Reconnections at the Magnetopause of the Martian Mini&#8208;Magnetosphere</title>

                Abstract While Mars lacks a global intrinsic magnetic field, it does exhibit crustal magnetic anomalies (mostly in its Southern Hemisphere). These crustal magnetic anomalies directly interact with solar wind, which forms a mini&#8208;magnetosphere and a region denoted the mini&#8208;magnetopause. Using magnetic field and plasma measurements from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, we report a novel case of magnetic reconnection at the Martian mini&#8208;magnetopause. In this process, protons and oxygen ions from the Martian atmosphere were accelerated during reconnection and likely escaped along the outflow direction. Magnetic reconnection may occur between the interplanetary magnetic field and crustal magnetic fields at the Martian mini&#8208;magnetopause, which contributes to planetary ion escape, solar wind entering the mini&#8208;magnetosphere and the evolution of magnetic topology in the dayside Martian mini&#8208;magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Magneto-structural phase transitions and two-dimensional spin waves in graphite</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1302/1/012034</link>
      <description>Nadina Gheorghiu, C R Ebbing, T. J. Haugan, IOP conference series. Materials science and engineering. 1302(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400360667

                Abstract We have previously found experimental evidence for several quantum phenomena in oxygen-ion implanted of hydrogenated graphite: ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagentism, triplet superconductivity, Andreev states, Little-Parks oscillations, Lamb shift, Casimir effect, colossal magnetoresistance, and topologically-protected flat-energy bands [1-6]. Triplet superconductivity results in the formation of Josephson junctions, thus with potential of being used for spintronics applications in the critical area of quantum computing. In this paper, we are showing new experimental evidence for the formation of two-dimensional (2D) spin waves in oxygen-ion enriched and in hydrogenated highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. The temperature evolution of the remanent magnetization M rem ( T ) data confirms the formation of spin waves that follow the 2D Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy. In addition, the step-like features also found in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity between insulating and metallic states suggest several outstanding possibilities, such as a structural transition, triplet superconductivity, and chiral properties.</description>

                Abstract Background Radiobiological effectiveness of radiation in cancer treatment can be studied at different scales (molecular till organ scale) and different time post irradiation. The production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species during water radiolysis is particularly relevant to understand the fundamental mechanisms playing a role in observed biological outcomes. The development and validation of Monte Carlo tools integrating the simulation of physical, physico&#8208;chemical and chemical stages after radiation is very important to maintain with experiments. Purpose Therefore, in this study, we propose to validate a new Geant4&#8208;DNA chemistry module through the simulation of water radiolysis and Fricke dosimetry experiments on a proton preclinical beam line. Material and methods In this study, we used the GATE Monte Carlo simulation platform (version 9.3) to simulate a 67.5 MeV proton beam produced with the ARRONAX isochronous cyclotron (IBA Cyclone 70XP) at conventional dose rate (0.2 Gy/s) to simulate the irradiation of ultra&#8208;pure liquid water samples and Fricke dosimeter. We compared the depth dose profile with measurements performed with a plane parallel Advanced PTW 34045 Markus ionization chamber. Then, a new Geant4&#8208;DNA chemistry application proposed from Geant4 version 11.2 has been used to assess the evolution of , , , , , , and reactive species along time until 1&#8208;h post&#8208;irradiation. In particular, the effect of oxygen and pH has been investigated through comparisons with experimental measurements of radiolytic yields for and Fe 3+ . Results GATE simulations reproduced, within 4%, the depth dose profile in liquid water. With Geant4&#8208;DNA, we were able to reproduce experimental radiolytic yields 1&#8208;h post&#8208;irradiation in aerated and deaerated conditions, showing the impact of small changes in oxygen concentrations on species evolution along time. For the Fricke dosimeter, simulated G(Fe 3+ ) is 15.97 &#177; 0.2 molecules/100 eV which is 11% higher than the measured value (14.4 &#177; 04 molecules/100 eV). Conclusions These results aim to be consolidated by new comparisons involving other radiolytic species, such as or to further study the mechanisms underlying the FLASH effect observed at ultra&#8208;high dose rates (UHDR).</description>

                Abstract Engineering oxygen vacancies (Vo) in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is considered as an effective strategy to improve the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) performance. However, the role of Vo and the metal sites for HzOR is still not fully understood. Herein, this study reports the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined bimetallic V O &#8208;rich benzene dicarboxylic acid&#8208;based MOF (NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC) as a model to clarify the intricate catalytic mechanism. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the Vo&#8208;rich environment favors the adsorption of OH &#8722; on the catalyst surface during the HzOR process, leading to the formation of Ni(OH) x active species. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced Ir at metal nodes not only boosts the HzOR activity of the Ni sites by tuning their electronic structure but also serves as the active sites for hydrogen evolution. As a result, the two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer with NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC || NiIr 0.03 &#8208;BDC configuration achieved 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.046 V. This work provides new insights into oxygen vacancy defect engineering of MOFs and paves a solid step for low&#8208;energy consumption hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of low-temperature oxidation analysis and the development effect of high-pressure air injection in low-permeability reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2024.1416824</link>
      <description>Xinyu Chen, Zhongchen Ba, Lu Zhang, Yuan Gao, Yang Zhou, Xinrui Li, Frontiers in earth science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400512960

                In order to solve the problems of conventional water injection development difficulties and low recovery factor in low-permeability reservoirs, the method of high-pressure air drive is adopted to achieve the purpose of reservoir energy enhancement and efficiency improvement. This paper conducted an experimental study on the mechanism of low-temperature oxidation (LTO) for crude oil in the process of high-pressure air flooding, elaborated the relationship between the LTO properties of crude oil and the temperature, pressure, and water saturation of the reservoir, and analyzed the differences in LTO oxygen consumption and oil components under different reaction conditions. In addition, combined with the air flooding physical simulation experiment, the dynamic evolution law of recovery rate in the air flooding process was revealed. Findings from this inquiry indicate that an escalation in the oxidation temperature significantly amplifies the oxygen incorporation reaction within the crude oil matrix. This augmentation in oxidative conditions leads to an uptick in oxygen consumption, which subsequently precipitates a reduction in the lighter fractions of the oxidized oil while enriching its heavier components. Elevated pressures were found to enhance the propensity for the amalgamation of unstable hydrocarbons with oxygen, fostering comprehensive and heterogeneous oxidation reactions. Notably, an excessive presence of water was observed to detrimentally affect the thermal efficacy of crude oil oxidation processes. In the context of low-permeability reservoirs, air injection techniques have emerged as superior in effectuating oil displacement, although an increase in injection pressures has been associated with the phenomenon of gas channeling. Interestingly, adopting a sequential strategy of initiating water flooding before air flooding facilitated the conveyance of high-pressure air via established flushing channels, although it appeared to attenuate the intensity of crude oil oxidation, culminating in an oil recovery efficiency peaking at 51%.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: A JWST comparative survey of aligned vs misaligned hot
  Jupiters to test the dependence of atmospheric composition on migration

                A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a new survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that orbit F stars above the Kraft break with different orbital alignments. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should lead to a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.</description>

      <title>High efficiency two-step electrocatalysis boosted by dual-motif bridge Co-S-Mo for Heterogeneous Electro-Fenton: Enhanced H2O2 production and fluoxetine elimination synergistic mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.153546</link>

                Heterogeneous electro-Fenton process is widely recognized as intensive in-situ strategy with environmental compatibility. However, the simultaneous elevation of H2O2 production and exploitation efficiency during electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we propose an innovative dual-site catalyst (MoxCo9&#8722;xS8&#8722;yNy; MCN) with Mo active motifs for enhanced two-electron oxygen reduction reaction and Co active motifs for enhanced reactive oxygen species generation to promote H2O2 generation and fluoxetine (FLX) degradation. As determined by Mo scaling and application performance, the optimal MCN catalyst provided at least 20 % increase in contaminant elimination within 30 min, reduced the reaction potential by over 1.4 eV, and diminished environmental exposure to toxic products. The optimal MCN@CF cathode efficiently removed approximately 96.7 % FLX and 55.1 % total organic carbon at a pH of 3 within 35 min. The critical dual-motif bridge Co&#8211;S&#8211;Mo mediated by S could disrupt the synergistic *O and *OOH binding energies, significantly penetrating the catalysis barriers. This work unravels the structural optimization evolution of non-single-site catalysts, providing new solutions to the refractory issues of wastewater decontamination</description>

                Abstract IRAS 00500+6713 is a hypothesized remnant of a Type Iax supernova SN 1181. Multiwavelength observations have revealed its complicated morphology; a dusty infrared ring is sandwiched by the inner and outer X-ray nebulae. We analyze the archival X-ray data taken by XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray Observatory to constrain the angular radius, mass, and metal abundance of the X-ray nebulae, and construct a theoretical model describing the dynamical evolution of IRAS 00500+6713, including the effects of the interaction between the SN ejecta and the intense wind enriched with carbon-burning ashes from the central white dwarf (WD) J005311. We show that the inner X-ray nebula corresponds to the wind termination shock while the outer X-ray nebula to the shocked interface between the SN ejecta and the interstellar matter. The observed X-ray properties can be explained by our model with an ejecta kinetic energy of E ej = (0.77&#8211;1.1) &#215; 10 48 erg, an ejecta mass of M ej = 0.18&#8211;0.53 M &#8857; , if the currently observed wind from WD J005311 started to blow t w &#8819; 810 yr after the explosion, i.e., approximately after 1990 CE. The inferred SN properties are compatible with those of Type Iax SNe and the timing of the wind launch may correspond to the Kelvin&#8211;Helmholtz contraction of the oxygen&#8211;neon core of WD J005311 that triggered a surface carbon burning. Our analysis supports that IRAS 00500+6713 is the remnant of SN Iax 1181 produced by a double degenerate merger of oxygen&#8211;neon and carbon&#8211;oxygen WDs, and WD J005311 is the surviving merger product.</description>

      <title>Cytochrome oxidase requirements in Bordetella reveal insights into evolution towards life in the mammalian respiratory tract</title>

                Little is known about oxygen utilization during infection by bacterial respiratory pathogens. The classical Bordetella species, including B . pertussis , the causal agent of human whooping cough, and B . bronchiseptica , which infects nearly all mammals, are obligate aerobes that use only oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor for electron transport-coupled oxidative phosphorylation. B . bronchiseptica , which occupies many niches, has eight distinct cytochrome oxidase-encoding loci, while B . pertussis , which evolved from a B . bronchiseptica -like ancestor but now survives exclusively in and between human respiratory tracts, has only three functional cytochrome oxidase-encoding loci: cydAB1 , ctaCDFGE1 , and cyoABCD1 . To test the hypothesis that the three cytochrome oxidases encoded within the B . pertussis genome represent the minimum number and class of cytochrome oxidase required for respiratory infection, we compared B . bronchiseptica strains lacking one or more of the eight possible cytochrome oxidases in vitro and in vivo . No individual cytochrome oxidase was required for growth in ambient air, and all three of the cytochrome oxidases conserved in B . pertussis were sufficient for growth in ambient air and low oxygen. Using a high-dose, large-volume persistence model and a low-dose, small-volume establishment of infection model, we found that B . bronchiseptica producing only the three B . pertussis -conserved cytochrome oxidases was indistinguishable from the wild-type strain for infection. We also determined that CyoABCD1 is sufficient to cause the same level of bacterial burden in mice as the wild-type strain and is thus the primary cytochrome oxidase required for murine infection, and that CydAB1 and CtaCDFGE1 fulfill auxiliary roles or are important for aspects of infection we have not assessed, such as transmission. Our results shed light on the environment at the surface of the ciliated epithelium, respiration requirements for bacteria that colonize the respiratory tract, and the evolution of virulence in bacterial pathogens.</description>

      <title>The antioxidative protection mechanism of the ultra-high temperature radome composite material BNf/SiBN</title>

                In the study, a BNf/SiBN composite was fabricated through precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) method. The oxidation resistance of the composite was investigated at different oxidation temperatures, focusing on the micro-structure evolution, the phase composition and oxidation kinetics of bare fibers versus fibers protected by the matrix under various oxidation states. The result indicates that the BNf/SiBN composite remains stable at 1100&#176;C in air atmosphere, while the fibers protected by matrix maintain their complete structure even at 1500&#176;C. Furthermore, we elucidated the oxidation mechanism of SiBN matrix: SiBN matrix undergoes a prior oxidation stage and transforms into amorphous SiO2 and B2O3 at high temperatures to impede the oxygen attachment to fibers while preserving the integrity of internal structure. The emergence of ultra-high temperature resistant BNf/SiBN composite and along with the exploration of oxidation behavior has opened up new approach for advancing radome material development.</description>

      <title>Early transition metal oxides with oxygen vacancies as new thermodynamically stable materials for electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124368</link>

                Currently developed electrocatalysts are difficult to achieve high thermodynamic stability at each active site. Early transition metal oxides are promising electrocatalysts with excellent thermodynamic stability and water dissociation ability for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, they have not been developed as direct-electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, we introduce oxygen vacancies (Vo) by electrodeposition to convert early transition metal oxides (scandium oxide (Sc2O3), yttrium oxide (Y2O3), and zirconium oxide (ZrO2)) into active electrocatalysts. By optimizing the metal element species and Vo content, the screened Y2O2.13@GP shows the lowest overpotential (266 mV at 500 mA cm-2. Moreover, Y2O2.13@GP is able to operate stably for over 1000 h at a current density of 500 mA cm-2 under harsh industrial conditions of 6.0 M KOH and 80&#176;C without dissolution and reconstruction. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of Vo can enhance the conductivity of the catalyst, increase the exposure of the active sites, modulate the electronic structure of Y2O2.13@GP, and decrease the *H adsorption and water dissociation energy barriers.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via
  accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf
  binaries</title>

                First, I demonstrate the possible formation channel for neutron stars (NSs) via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) composition white dwarfs (WDs) inside planetary nebulae (PNe; also so-called symbiotic nebulae). A heavy mass loss via the stellar wind or during the the roche-lobe overfilling (RLOF) mass-transfer may happen at the late evolutionary phase of ONeMg WD - red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, and it might form nebulae with central accreting WD binaries. The nebulae might be ionized the hot cores of giant stars or accreting WDs. Therefore, the accreting WD inside the symbiotic nebulae might grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit mass and collapse. Peculiar NSs born via the AIC of WDs inside the symbiotic nebulae (PNe) may finally have WD companions and become the NS-WD systems, and the Milky Way may contain tens of such kind of systems. Second, I introduce another possibility for the formation of PNe (or pulsar wind nebulae) with newborn NS via the core-merger-induced collapse during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Limitation Induced by Hydroxyl in Regulating Solvation Structure of Zn2+ and Overcoming Challenges with Hybrid Additives towards Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401073</link>
      <description>Fuxiang Li, Junfeng Yang, Minghui Wang, Xiang Feng, Mingyan Li, Hong Zheng, NULL AUTHOR_ID, NULL AUTHOR_ID, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400431634

                In the field of electrolyte design for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), additives containing hydroxyl have been demonstrated to effectively modulate the solvation structure of Zn2+. However, reported studies typically focus solely on the effectiveness of hydroxyl while neglecting the issues that emerge during solvation structure regulation. The strong electron&#8208;attracting capability of Zn2+ attracts electrons from the oxygen in hydroxyl, thereby weakening the strength of hydroxyl, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is also pronounced. This work innovatively reveals the limitation of hydroxyl&#8208;containing additives and proposes a synergistic regulation strategy based on hybrid additives. Arginine with a high isoelectric point is introduced into the electrolyte system containing hydroxyl additives. The protonation effect and electrostatic attraction of arginine enable it to absorb protons at the anode released by the weakened hydroxyl, thereby compensating for the limitation of hydroxyl additives. Under the synergistic action of hybrid additives, the Zn|Zn battery achieved stable deposition/stripping for over 1200 hours under 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the Zn|Cu battery cycled for over 570 hours with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.82%. This study presents a pioneering perspective for the further application of AZIBs.</description>

                Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are high-strength, high-modulus nanotubes with high thermal and oxidative stabilities. Two hybrid composites were prepared with satin weave CF and resole-type phenolic resin: one with surface layers of BNNTs and one with alternating interlayers of BNNTs. The samples were subjected to hot jet tests that simulate realistic high-pressure-temperature conditions to understand the behavior of BNNTs under high-pressure erosion. Adding BNNTs to CF/phenolic laminates enhanced the ablation resistance by reinforcing the char material and mitigated localized thermal damage. Hybrid laminates exhibited up to 14% lower weight loss, 55% increase in flexural modulus, higher thermal diffusivity, and improved char yield and microstructure compared to CF/phenolic samples. The surface layer hybrid had many surviving nanotubes reinforcing the char and crystalline oxide structures that could mitigate further oxygen diffusion. Various characterization methods were used to deduce possible mechanisms and their products, indicating that BNNTs could serve as growth templates for direct crystalline boron oxide formation. Overall, hybrid BNNT/CF/phenolic laminates displayed better ablation resistance and favorable microstructure evolution under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Element abundances of galactic RGB stars in the APO-K2 catalogue.
  Dissimilarity in the scaling with [$\alpha$/Fe]</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2407.05960</link>
      <description>G. Valle, M. Dell&#8217;Omodarme, P. G. Prada Moroni, S. Degl&#8217;Innocenti, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400484088

                We conducted an investigation on the chemical abundances of 4,316 stars in the red giant branch (RGB) phase from the recently released APO-K2 catalogue. Our aim was to characterize the abundance trends of the single elements with [$\alpha$/Fe], mainly focusing on C, N, and O, which are the most relevant for the estimation of stellar ages. The chemical analysis of the RGB sample involved cross-matching data from the APO-K2 catalogue with individual element abundances from APOGEE DR17. The analysis detected a statistically significant difference in the [(C+N+O)/Fe] - [$\alpha$/Fe] trend with respect to the simple $\alpha$-enhancement scenario. This difference remained robust across different choices for the reference solar mixture and potential zero-point calibrations of C and N abundances. The primary discrepancy was a steeper increase in [O/Fe] with [$\alpha$/Fe], reaching a 0.1 dex difference at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3. Notably, the impact on the evolutionary timescale of such oxygen over-abundance with respect to the commonly adopted uniform $\alpha$-enhancement is rather limited. We verified that stellar models computed using an ad hoc O-rich mixture sped up the evolution by only 1% at [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.3, due to the counterbalancing effects of O enrichment on both the evolutionary timescale and the Z-to-[Fe/H] relationship.</description>

      <title>Siderite from the Tibetan Himalaya: Evidence for a low sulphate ocean during Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (Early Aptian)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/sed.13218</link>
      <description>Fancheng Meng, Zhong Han, Xiumian Hu, Hugh C. Jenkyns, Bolin Zhang, Yang Liu, Mingcai Hou, Sedimentology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400363472

                Abstract Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events were characterized by relatively low seawater sulphate concentrations ([]), which likely regulated the development and evolution of these major palaeoceanographic phenomena. However, there is little reliable sedimentary evidence for low [] in ancient marine waters and understanding of how such a seawater chemistry potentially impacted oceanic anoxic events is limited. This study presents an integrated sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical investigation of the mineral siderite hosted in dark grey shale and sideritic concretions of Early Aptian (coeval with Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a) from the Tibetan Himalaya. Siderite is present throughout the section and possesses similar morphological characteristics whether in dark grey shale or concretions. Siderite can be present as disseminated and rhombic crystals formed during early diagenesis, or minor spherical crystals formed during late diagenesis. The evidence from redox elements, middle rare&#8208;earth element bulge patterns and extremely low carbon&#8208;isotope values of the sideritic concretions indicates that the iron carbonate was formed in the Fe&#8208;reduction zones by the process of dissimilatory iron reduction. This process would have required conditions of low [], reducing environment, abundant iron and high alkalinity. Additionally, the coexistence of siderite and pyrite may indicate that dissimilatory iron reduction occurred close to the microbial sulphate reduction zone, with seawater [] hovering around the tipping point at which pyrite could form once seawater sulphate increased. Such an increase during Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a could have resulted from basalt&#8211;seawater interaction and associated enhanced continental weathering, and/or hydrothermal activity. This study's observations support the previous hypothesis that low [] for Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a was probably caused by massive gypsum burial in the proto&#8208;South Atlantic. Subsequently, enhanced sulphate input could have promoted microbial sulphate reduction and accompanying oxidation of organic matter, which likely further enhanced nutrient recycling, increased primary productivity and organic&#8208;carbon burial, leading to more oxygen consumption and expansion of oxygen minimum zones, as reconstructed for many oceanic anoxic events.</description>

      <title>Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Photoreduction into CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Triggered by the Synergy between Oxygen Vacancy and Ru Substitution under Near&#8208;Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202405668</link>

                Abstract Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light powdered CO 2 photoreduction reaction is generally restricted to the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and the supply of active hydrogen (*H). Herein, the study reports a retrofitting hydrogenated MoO 3&#8208;x (H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x ) nanosheet photocatalysts with Ru single atom substitution (Ru@H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x ) fabricated by one&#8208;step solvothermal method. Experiments together with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Ru substitution and oxygen vacancy can not only inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers, but also facilitate the CO 2 adsorption/activation as well as the supply of *H. Compared with H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x , the Ru@H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x exhibit more favorable formation of *CHO in the process of *CO conversion due to the fast *H generation on electron&#8208;rich Ru sites and transfer to *CO intermediates, leading to the preferential photoreduction of CO 2 to CH 4 with high selectivity. The optimized Ru@H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x exhibits a superior CO 2 photoreduction activity with CH 4 evolution rate of 111.6 and 39.0 &#181;mol g catalyst &#8722;1 under full spectrum and NIR light irradiation, respectively, which is 8.8 and 15.0 times much higher than that of H&#8208;MoO 3&#8208;x . This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding at the atomic level on the design of NIR responsive photocatalyst for achieving the goal of carbon neutrality.</description>

                Asgard archaea were pivotal in the origin of complex cellular life. Hodarchaeales (Asgardarchaeota class Heimdallarchaeia) were recently shown to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Clean Energy: Exploring FeVO4 Nanopebble Thin Film as an Outstanding Photoanode for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.175391</link>
      <description>Sutripto Majumder, Abhijit A. Yadav, Levin Anbu Gomez, Y.M. Hunge, R. Srinivasan, Ki Hyeon Kim, Journal of alloys and compounds. 1002(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400314472

                This study presents a two-step synthesis approach utilizing the hydrothermal method and drop casting for the fabrication of FeVO4 (FVO) thin films onto FTO-coated glass substrates, employing sacrificial basic FeOOH (FOH) nanostructured thin films. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the formation of FVO nanopebble thin films. Morphological and elemental analyses revealed that the thickness and grain size of the FVO nanopebbles increased, reaching maximum values depending on the parent FOH nanostructures. Additionally, the optimized FVO nanopebbles exhibited a high content of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, a gradual increase in grain size and film thickness observed through the phenomenon of red-shifting in the optical band gap. The well-optimized FVO photoanode delivers the highest photocurrent density of 0.3 mA cm&#8722;2 at an applied bias of 1.6 V (vs. RHE) under standard illumination, demonstrating exceptional stability under these conditions. Moreover, the photoanode exhibited exceptional injection efficiency of 96.7% compared to separation efficiency, as evidenced by photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) studies. Furthermore, the optimized photoelectrode exhibited a hydrogen evolution rate of 11.96 &#956;mol h&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 with a faradaic efficiency of 98.73% after one hour. Overall, the synthesized FVO nanopebble thin films shows promising potential for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting applications.</description>

                Abstract This study analyzes the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Prydz Bay by Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometry to probe the carbon sequestration capacity in the continental shelf system. Concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with water depth show that POC could be mainly decomposed into DOC and/or microbially degraded. Highly labile DOC is further degraded and remineralized by microorganisms within the upper 200 m, as evidenced by a downward enrichment of 13 C POC and increases in the average molecular weight, oxygen atom number (O) and double bond equivalents of DOM molecules, indicating that biodegradation is the main driver for particulate organic matter and DOM evolution with water depth. Semi&#8208;quantitative calculation demonstrates that &#8764;83% of POC was transformed to DOC as well as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and &#8764;30% of DOC further to DIC via microbial degradation within the upper 200 m in summer, resulting in a relatively low total organic carbon content in sediments of Prydz Bay. The newly transformed DIC and residue DOC can be preserved in the deep layer due to the formation of well stratified and stable water body in summer of Prydz Bay, ultimately entering the regional circulation system instead of being released back into the atmosphere. This could be one of the most important processes determining the atmosphere CO 2 uptake in the continental shelf system of Southern Ocean.</description>

                Vertical profiles of salinity, and isotopic abundance ratios of hydrogen (&#948;2H ) and oxygen (@delta;18O) of 18 landfast ice cores, collected along the northeast coast of James Bay in March 2019, and one ice core collected in Belcher Islands, were used to obtain the winter timeseries of the spatiotemporal evolution of the under-ice plume of La Grande River (LGR), the dominant river in the area. Variability in the isotopic composition and salinity of the ice cores indicated changes to the water source composition at the ice-water interface when the ice layers formed. The increased presence of river water beneath the ice during January-March was marked by more negative isotopic ratios in the lower portion of the ice as river discharge was increased for hydroelectric production. River water was the source of ~43% of the ice in our ice core samples (n=320) with the interquartile range from 16% to 71%. The river water fractions incorporated into the ice indicate that LGR under-ice plume extended more than 75 km north and at least 30 km south of the river mouth for ~3 months. These findings correspond well with more challenging to obtain hydrographic observations. End-of-winter ice core sampling and analysis for isotopic abundance has potential as a tool to monitor dispersal of LGR discharge into the ice-covered coastal environment.</description>

      <title>Re&#8722;Os Isotope and PGE Abundance Systematics of Coast Range Ophiolite Peridotites and Chromitite, California: Insights into Fore-Arc Magmatic Processes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2113/2024/lithosphere_2024_154</link>
      <description>Sung Hi Choi, Samuel B. Mukasa, John W. Shervais, I. S. Puchtel, Lithosphere. 2024(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400498125

                Abstract We report platinum-group element (PGE) and Re concentrations, and Re&#8722;Os isotopic data for peridotites and podiform chromitite from the mid-Jurassic Coast Range ophiolite (CRO), California. Our aim is to provide insights into the formation and evolution of the CRO in a fore-arc tectonic setting. The CRO peridotites are divided into two groups: abyssal and supra-subduction zone (SSZ). They have Ir-group PGE concentrations similar to estimates for the primitive mantle and nearly chondritic relative abundances [(Os/Ir)N &#8776; 1.1]. Abyssal-type peridotites have slightly subchondritic Pd-group PGE (PPGE)&#8722;Re abundances and flat chondrite-normalized patterns, whereas the SSZ-type ones are depleted overall with highly fractionated PPGE&#8722;Re patterns. The CRO peridotites have 187Os/188Os values of 0.1188 to 0.1315 (&#947;Os = &#8722;8.3 to 1.4) and 187Re/188Os ranging from 0.022 to 0.413. The oxygen fugacity based on the V/Yb ratios of the CRO peridotites is equivalent to the fayalite&#8722;magnetite&#8722;quartz buffer. The abyssal-type peridotites are residues after &#8804;5% melting of the primitive upper mantle and represent a remnant of oceanic lithosphere trapped in an SSZ setting but before it was re-melted or modified by subduction processes. The abyssal-type peridotites yield an aluminachron model age of ~1.5 Ga, implying that the CRO mantle had experienced episode(s) of melt extraction before the CRO crust was formed. The SSZ-type peridotites are refractory residues after ~5% to 15% melting. Extraction of fore-arc basalts generated mainly by decompression melting resulted in the SSZ-type peridotites. The chromitite has 187Os/188Os value of 0.1250 (&#947;Os = &#8722;3.5) and PGE&#8722;Re patterns complementary to that of boninite, indicating a genetic link to fore-arc magmatism.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Metallicity Analysis of J0332&#8722;3557: Establishing a z &#8764; 4 Anchor for Direct Gas Metallicity and C/O Abundance Investigations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4600</link>
      <description>Annalisa Citro, Danielle A. Berg, Dawn K. Erb, Matthew W. Auger, George D. Becker, Bethan L. James, Evan D. Skillman, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 969(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400453327

                Abstract We provide one of the most comprehensive metallicity studies at z &#8764; 4 by analyzing the UV/optical Hubble Space Telescope photometry and rest-frame Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FORS2 UV and VLT/XSHOOTER optical spectra of J0332&#8722;3557, a gravitationally lensed galaxy magnified by a factor of 20. With a 5 &#963; detection of the auroral O iii ] &#955; 1666 line, we are able to derive a direct gas metallicity estimate for our target. We find Z gas  = 12 + log ( O  /  H ) = 8.26 &#177; 0.06  , which is compatible with an increase of both the gas fraction and the outflow metal loading factor from z &#8764; 0 to z &#8764; 4. J0332&#8722;3557 is the most metal-rich individual galaxy at z &#8764; 4 for which the C/O ratio has been measured. We derive a low log(C/O) = &#8722;1.02 &#177; 0.2, which suggests that J0332&#8722;3557 is in the early stages of interstellar medium carbon enrichment driven mostly by massive stars. The low C/O abundance also indicates that J0332&#8722;3557 is characterized by a low star formation efficiency, higher yields of oxygen, and longer burst duration. We find that EW C III ]1906,9 is as low as &#8764;3 &#197;, and the main drivers of the low EW C III ]1906,9 are the higher gas metallicity and the low C/O abundance. J0332&#8722;3557 is characterized by one diffuse and two more compact regions &#8764;1 kpc in size. We find that the carbon emission mostly originates in the compact knots. Our study on J0332&#8722;3557 serves as an anchor for studies investigating the evolution of metallicity and C/O abundance across different redshifts.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Modeling of the Local Reaction Environment in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-t37bp-v2</link>
      <description>Xinwei Zhu, Jun Huang, Michael Eikerling, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400469170

                Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reactions and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes that occur in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at a solid-liquid interface. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties such as the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in specific groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches often fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH, cation, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to exert strong impacts on electrocatalytic reactions. There is growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Increasing attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. To this end, unraveling the LRE is becoming essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are getting more and more important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales and interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from &lt; 0.1 to 100 &#956;m. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) microkinetic modelling that accounts for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. Vital insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations.</description>

                ICMC LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 2023 David Evans Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and Advanced Cryogenic Materials Ltd. United Kingdom Prof. Xavier Obradors Institut de Ci&#232;ncia de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC) and Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (RACAB) Spain ICMC has presented its Award for Lifetime Achievement, typically biannually, at the CEC/ICMC conference since its 30 th anniversary conference in Keystone in 2005 to an individual to &#8220;recognize a lifetime&#8217;s achievement in advancing the knowledge of cryogenic materials&#8221;. The eleventh and twelfth recipients of the ICMC Lifetime Achievement Award are David Evans and Xavier Obradors, who follow Edward W. Collings in 2005, David C. Larbalestier in 2007, Kyoji Tachikawa in 2009, Ren&#233; Fl&#252;kiger in 2011, Harold Weber in 2013, Herbert Freyhardt in 2015, Kozo Osamura in 2017, Archie Campbell in 2018, Teruo Matsushita in 2019, and Shi Xue Dou in 2021. DAVID EVANS Dave Evans has been evaluating, developing, and deploying cryogenic materials beginning in 1967 at the Rutherford Appleton National Laboratory after he earned a degree in chemistry at the University of North London. He has continued actively working on cryogenic materials after retiring in 2001 through his consulting company Advanced Cryogenic Materials Ltd. He is known internationally for developing, characterizing, and using non-metallic materials and structures for cryogenic applications. He worked on projects around the world (European Union, United States, Japan, Russia, Korea, and China) and established a technical reputation for the selection, design, testing, and low-temperature employment of epoxy resins, glass-reinforced/epoxy composite laminates, radiation-resistant composite insulation, and vacuum-pressure resin impregnation of large-scale magnets. Evans was one of the pioneers in developing and characterizing low-temperature epoxy resin systems for use in resin impregnation and electrical insulation for high-energy physics magnets. One aspect of his knowledge was of the low-temperature radiation resistance of organic materials, from his research on the effects that thermal and fast neutrons have on the mechanical properties, swelling, gas emission, and permeability of the organic epoxies. These radiation studies were done at room and cryogenic temperatures with different dosages to understand the effects that the cross-linking in the epoxy polymer chains had on gas evolution and fracture (chain scission). The knowledge he developed about epoxy systems directly contributed to building successful magnets around the world, including at DESY, CERN, and ITER. For example, Evans was part of a team (including Richard Reed, Paul Fabian, and Paul Clark) that developed and characterized a low viscosity epoxy system for large superconducting magnets that was used for the ITER central solenoid (CS). They developed a vacuum polymer impregnation (VPI) system to outgas the magnet and resin components, and then inject, gel, and cure the resin in the ITER CS Model Coil (MC) and CS Modules with virtually no defects. At the time, the CS MC established a world record for injecting more than 300 gallons of resin in the coil. Over the years Evans amassed an encyclopedic understanding of epoxy systems that he generously shared with colleagues. This included such things as expiration of the epoxy components, acceptable tolerances on the mixes, temperatures, and pressures, insulation drying in the mold, and acceptable outgassing rates in the insulation before transferring the resin into the mold. This information is critical for successful applications. A colleague described his kindness, humbleness, generosity and willingness to share his immense accumulated knowledge about composite behavior at cryogenic conditions as a precious gift for his colleagues and for many industries around the world. Citation for Evans&#8216;s award : In recognition of his domestic and international contributions developing, characterizing, and using non-metallic materials and structures for a wide variety of cryogenic applications. XAVIER OBRADORS Xavier Obradors earned a PhD in Physics from the University of Barcelona in 1982 and has been active in superconductivity since high-temperature superconductors were discovered. He is a Research Professor, Director of the the Institut de Ci&#232;ncia de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC), and a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (RACAB) Spain. Early on Obradors investigated high-temperature superconductors growing single domain YBCO crystals using the Bridgman and the top-seeded pellet techniques. He focused on understanding vortex pinning with respect to the defect structure in these materials and also worked on their applications for fault current limiters, magnetic levitation, and motor applications. Obradors shifted his focus to REBCO coated conductors (CC) made by the chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique. His group at ICMAB-CSIC has focused on developing this inexpensive technique using innovative approaches to study all aspects related to CSD. These include establishing CSD routes to fabricate all the buffer layers and the REBCO layer, deconvoluting the epitaxial REBCO growth mechanism, generating flux pinning nanocomposites using spontaneous segregation or multi-functional colloidal solutions, and understanding nanoscale defect structures and their relation to vortex pinning. Again, he has pursued practical application of the CCs in fault current limiters and for high field magnets. Recently they are studying ultrafast CSD growth of REBCO CCs, which is critical to reduce the production cost of YBCO to better enable many commercial applications. A strength of the REBCO studies has been using transmission electron studies to deconstruct the many types of vortex pinning present in the highly engineered films into strong and weak pinning and isotropic and oriented defects. This way of thinking about the various types of pinning defects that are deliberately or otherwise introduced into the REBCO films has been enormously productive. Their TEM studies have found strong evidence for oxygen vacancy pinning (weak and isotropic) whose density correlates well with the strain deduced from x-ray measurements. A colleague wrote that &#8220;Obradors has a knack for being able to provide insightful criticism, both positive and negative, in a very positive way. I am sure that such qualities, in addition to his technical capabilities, contribute to why he has been such a valued European project leader.&#8221; Citation for Obradors&#8216;s award : In recognition of his early studies on bulk melt-textured REBCO and recent studies of chemical solution deposition of REBCO coated conductors, focusing on the underlying materials science and developing them for practical applications.</description>
