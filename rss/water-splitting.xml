High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

      <title>Nano&#8208;Au&#8208;decorated hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide derived from ZIF&#8208;67 toward optimized oxygen evolution catalysis: Important roles of microstructures and electronic modulation</title>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8208;group Metal Compound Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Production: Recent Advances and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301241</link>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Surface Reconstruction of FeOOH/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Redistribution via Anionic Modulator for Superb and Highly Stable Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07364</link>
      <description>Jiawen Cui, Junzhi Li, Xu Zhao, Guichen Gao, Ming Ya, Haitong Tang, Mingrui Wang, Dongdong Li, Guangshe Li, Guangshe Li, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2024.
Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

      <title>Regulating Reaction Intermediate Adsorption of Co&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Nanorods for Efficient Urea Electrolysis</title>

Urea-assisted water electrolysis integrated by a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, its practical application requires catalysts with sufficient durability and high-strength reactant/product diffusion capability under large current densities. Herein, the Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2 coral-like nanorods (Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF) of electronic structure and morphology regulation are rationally constructed. The heterostructure and sulfur vacancies induce interfacial charge redistribution, thus promoting the adsorption of urea and *OH intermediates, accompanied by accelerating the dissociation of H2O. Moreover, the hierarchical nanorod structure ensures mass transfer and gas product rapid escape. As a result, Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF only takes 1.45 V and &#8722;345 mV to reach large current densities of &#177;1500 mA cm&#8211;2 for the UOR and HER, respectively. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis system needs only 2.00 V to obtain 1500 mA cm&#8211;2, and it can operate stably for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2. This work illustrates the importance of regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates to design advanced catalysts for energy-efficient H2 production from urea electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Reconstructed RuMnOx with enhanced performance in acidic water oxidation</title>

Transition metals-doped noble electrocatalysts are commonly applied for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notwithstanding, most transition metal oxides are unstable under the conditions of acidic OER, questioning the real active sites on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Herein, RuMnOx is explored more than 30 % activity increased (at 1.7 V) after chronoamperometric activation measurement. The activities are improved when the chronoamperometric measurement potentials below 1.1 V. Coupling electrochemical measurements with Mn dissolution and Ru redeposition studies, we verify that the reconstruction of catalysts is responsible for the activated electrochemical activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activity is enhanced by more hydroxyl adsorption on the surface, and the activated RuMnOx shows robust durability with a 0.027 mV/h potential increase rate for 2,600 h at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024.
In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Non-metal doping regulation in transition metal and their compounds for electrocatalytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.256</link>

Hydrogen is currently recognized as being able to mitigate the overuse of fossil fuels and as a clean energy source in future development. In addition, water electrolysis can work with renewable energy sources to make the hydrogen cycle sustainable. However, hydrogen production efficiency from water electrolysis relies on efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At present, in order to further develop overall water splitting (OWS) catalysts, non-metal doping has attracted increasing attention. Non-metals can modulate the electronic structure, lattice structure, and surface properties of transition metal-based catalysts, which can be a new strategy to regulate the catalytic activity. Herein, the recent research progresses of non-metallic doping in transition metal-based catalysts are reviewed in this paper. This article summarizes the inherent correlation between the electronic structure and local environmental changes of water electrolysis catalytic materials with different non-metallic elements in the transition metal-based materials. Then, the reasons and related mechanisms for the improved performance of catalysts by nonmetal doping are discussed. The aim of this review is to offer some insights in favour of the role that non-metallic doping owns special advantages in electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

The electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived furfural (FF) feedstocks into 2-furoic acid (FA) holds immense industrial potential in optics, cosmetics, polymers, and food. Herein, we fabricated CoO/NiO/nickel foam (NF) and Cu2O/NiO/NF electrodes via in situ pulsed laser irradiation in liquids (PLIL) for the bifunctional electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and furfural oxidation reaction (FOR), respectively. Simultaneous oxidation of NF surface to NiO and deposition of CoO and/or Cu2O on NF during PLIL offer distinct advantages for enhancing both the OER and FOR. CoO/NiO/NF electrocatalyst provides a consistently low overpotential of &#8764;359 mV (OER) at 10 mA/cm2, achieving the maximum FA yield (&#8764;16.37 mM) with 61.5% selectivity, 79.5% carbon balance, and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;90.1% during 2 h of FOR at 1.43 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Mechanistic pathway via in situ electrochemical-Raman spectroscopy on CoO/NiO/NF reveals the involvement of phase transition intermediates (NiOOH and CoOOH) as surface-active centers during electrochemical oxidation. The carbonyl carbon in FF is attacked by hydroxyl groups to form unstable hydrates that subsequently undergo further oxidation to yield FA products. This method holds promise for large-scale applications, enabling simultaneous production of renewable building materials and fuel.</description>

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is proposed as an exemplary half-reaction in renewable energy applications because of its low thermodynamical potential. However, challenges persist due to sluggish reaction kinetics and complex by-products separation. To this end, we introduce the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), propelling a novel UOR route using a modified CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst termed CFRO-7. Theoretical calculations and in-situ characterizations highlight the activated lattice oxygen (OL) within CFRO-7 as pivotal sites for UOR, optimizing the reaction pathway and accelerating the kinetics. For the urea overall electrolysis application, the LOM route only requires a low voltage of 1.54 V to offer a high current of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for long-term utilization (&gt;48 h). Importantly, the by-product NCO&#8722; is significantly suppressed, while the CO2/N2 separation is efficiently achieved. This work proposed a pioneering paradigm, invoking the LOM pathway in urea electrolysis to expedite reaction dynamics and enhance product selectivity.</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Fe&#8722;N bonds induced highly efficient Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.133158</link>

Fe-based catalysts with the merits of the most abundant reserves in the crust, cheapest, and low toxicity, show significant superiorities to noble-metal catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting. Fe3O4 as a member of Fe-based catalysts has been widely used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it is rarely applied for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to the lack of inherent active sites for hydrogen absorption. Fe&#8722;N coordination bonds can act as active sites for electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, we reasonably designed and constructed Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction, where abundant Fe&#8722;N bonds acting as HER active sites were formed with the aid of rich Pyridine N of g-C3N4. Activity characterization result indicates the optimized 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction exhibits excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec-1, and outstanding cycle stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance stems from the Fe&#8722;N bonding interaction, which endows 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 with lower water dissociation barrier and a moderate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*) in comparison with pristine Fe3O4 and g-C3N4.</description>

Abstract Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605 Wh kg &#8722;1 NaO2 ) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive and thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm &#8722;2 ) and superior output power. Herein, we adopted 3D&#8208;printing technology to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O 2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O 2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O 2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density up to 4 mA cm &#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4 mW cm &#8722;2 , giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm &#8722;2 . The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries towards practical applications.

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst.

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Electronic Redistribution via Anionic Modulator for Superb and Highly Stable Water/Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07364</link>

Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

      <title>Regulating Reaction Intermediate Adsorption of Co&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;NiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Nanorods for Efficient Urea Electrolysis</title>

Urea-assisted water electrolysis integrated by a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, its practical application requires catalysts with sufficient durability and high-strength reactant/product diffusion capability under large current densities. Herein, the Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2 coral-like nanorods (Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF) of electronic structure and morphology regulation are rationally constructed. The heterostructure and sulfur vacancies induce interfacial charge redistribution, thus promoting the adsorption of urea and *OH intermediates, accompanied by accelerating the dissociation of H2O. Moreover, the hierarchical nanorod structure ensures mass transfer and gas product rapid escape. As a result, Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF only takes 1.45 V and &#8722;345 mV to reach large current densities of &#177;1500 mA cm&#8211;2 for the UOR and HER, respectively. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis system needs only 2.00 V to obtain 1500 mA cm&#8211;2, and it can operate stably for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2. This work illustrates the importance of regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates to design advanced catalysts for energy-efficient H2 production from urea electrolysis.</description>

Transition metals-doped noble electrocatalysts are commonly applied for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notwithstanding, most transition metal oxides are unstable under the conditions of acidic OER, questioning the real active sites on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Herein, RuMnOx is explored more than 30 % activity increased (at 1.7 V) after chronoamperometric activation measurement. The activities are improved when the chronoamperometric measurement potentials below 1.1 V. Coupling electrochemical measurements with Mn dissolution and Ru redeposition studies, we verify that the reconstruction of catalysts is responsible for the activated electrochemical activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activity is enhanced by more hydroxyl adsorption on the surface, and the activated RuMnOx shows robust durability with a 0.027 mV/h potential increase rate for 2,600 h at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

      <title>Non-metal doping regulation in transition metal and their compounds for electrocatalytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.12.256</link>

Hydrogen is currently recognized as being able to mitigate the overuse of fossil fuels and as a clean energy source in future development. In addition, water electrolysis can work with renewable energy sources to make the hydrogen cycle sustainable. However, hydrogen production efficiency from water electrolysis relies on efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At present, in order to further develop overall water splitting (OWS) catalysts, non-metal doping has attracted increasing attention. Non-metals can modulate the electronic structure, lattice structure, and surface properties of transition metal-based catalysts, which can be a new strategy to regulate the catalytic activity. Herein, the recent research progresses of non-metallic doping in transition metal-based catalysts are reviewed in this paper. This article summarizes the inherent correlation between the electronic structure and local environmental changes of water electrolysis catalytic materials with different non-metallic elements in the transition metal-based materials. Then, the reasons and related mechanisms for the improved performance of catalysts by nonmetal doping are discussed. The aim of this review is to offer some insights in favour of the role that non-metallic doping owns special advantages in electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic-mechanism of water and furfural oxidation on pulsed laser-interlaced Cu2O and CoO on nickel foam</title>

The electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived furfural (FF) feedstocks into 2-furoic acid (FA) holds immense industrial potential in optics, cosmetics, polymers, and food. Herein, we fabricated CoO/NiO/nickel foam (NF) and Cu2O/NiO/NF electrodes via in situ pulsed laser irradiation in liquids (PLIL) for the bifunctional electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and furfural oxidation reaction (FOR), respectively. Simultaneous oxidation of NF surface to NiO and deposition of CoO and/or Cu2O on NF during PLIL offer distinct advantages for enhancing both the OER and FOR. CoO/NiO/NF electrocatalyst provides a consistently low overpotential of &#8764;359 mV (OER) at 10 mA/cm2, achieving the maximum FA yield (&#8764;16.37 mM) with 61.5% selectivity, 79.5% carbon balance, and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;90.1% during 2 h of FOR at 1.43 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Mechanistic pathway via in situ electrochemical-Raman spectroscopy on CoO/NiO/NF reveals the involvement of phase transition intermediates (NiOOH and CoOOH) as surface-active centers during electrochemical oxidation. The carbonyl carbon in FF is attacked by hydroxyl groups to form unstable hydrates that subsequently undergo further oxidation to yield FA products. This method holds promise for large-scale applications, enabling simultaneous production of renewable building materials and fuel.</description>

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is proposed as an exemplary half-reaction in renewable energy applications because of its low thermodynamical potential. However, challenges persist due to sluggish reaction kinetics and complex by-products separation. To this end, we introduce the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), propelling a novel UOR route using a modified CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst termed CFRO-7. Theoretical calculations and in-situ characterizations highlight the activated lattice oxygen (OL) within CFRO-7 as pivotal sites for UOR, optimizing the reaction pathway and accelerating the kinetics. For the urea overall electrolysis application, the LOM route only requires a low voltage of 1.54 V to offer a high current of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for long-term utilization (&gt;48 h). Importantly, the by-product NCO&#8722; is significantly suppressed, while the CO2/N2 separation is efficiently achieved. This work proposed a pioneering paradigm, invoking the LOM pathway in urea electrolysis to expedite reaction dynamics and enhance product selectivity.</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

Fe-based catalysts with the merits of the most abundant reserves in the crust, cheapest, and low toxicity, show significant superiorities to noble-metal catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting. Fe3O4 as a member of Fe-based catalysts has been widely used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it is rarely applied for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to the lack of inherent active sites for hydrogen absorption. Fe&#8722;N coordination bonds can act as active sites for electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, we reasonably designed and constructed Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction, where abundant Fe&#8722;N bonds acting as HER active sites were formed with the aid of rich Pyridine N of g-C3N4. Activity characterization result indicates the optimized 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction exhibits excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec-1, and outstanding cycle stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance stems from the Fe&#8722;N bonding interaction, which endows 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 with lower water dissociation barrier and a moderate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*) in comparison with pristine Fe3O4 and g-C3N4.</description>

Abstract Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605 Wh kg &#8722;1 NaO2 ) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive and thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm &#8722;2 ) and superior output power. Herein, we adopted 3D&#8208;printing technology to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O 2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O 2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O 2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density up to 4 mA cm &#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4 mW cm &#8722;2 , giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm &#8722;2 . The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries towards practical applications.

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Surface Reconstruction of FeOOH/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts</title>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Rational construction of efficient and stable transition-metal (TM)-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extraordinarily favored and crucial to water/seawater splitting. Interface and heteroatom engineering are powerful strategies for improving the performance of the OER. Herein, we report a unique hydroxide/oxide heterostructure catalyst with P doping (Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) by an in situ growth strategy, following low-temperature phosphorylation for boosting water oxidation. The Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P electrode, featuring an abundance of nanosheets, provides a greater number of functional active boundaries and enhances contact with the electrolyte for accelerated charge transfer. The incorporation of a P anionic modulator induces electron redistribution at heterogeneous interfaces, thereby tailoring the strong metal&#8211;anion interactions. Detailed electrochemical analysis further demonstrates that the Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P heterostructure is an outstanding OER electrocatalyst, presenting low overpotentials of 224, 253, and 274 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline solution, alkaline simulated seawater, and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The cell voltage of the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer (Pt/C &#8741; Ni(OH)2/NiFe2O4&#8211;P) to deliver 10 mA cm&#8211;2 is only 1.62 V and can operate reliably for 150 h in an alkaline electrolyte.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Urea-assisted water electrolysis integrated by a urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an efficient strategy for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, its practical application requires catalysts with sufficient durability and high-strength reactant/product diffusion capability under large current densities. Herein, the Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2 coral-like nanorods (Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF) of electronic structure and morphology regulation are rationally constructed. The heterostructure and sulfur vacancies induce interfacial charge redistribution, thus promoting the adsorption of urea and *OH intermediates, accompanied by accelerating the dissociation of H2O. Moreover, the hierarchical nanorod structure ensures mass transfer and gas product rapid escape. As a result, Co0.5NiS2&#8211;Ni3S2/NF only takes 1.45 V and &#8722;345 mV to reach large current densities of &#177;1500 mA cm&#8211;2 for the UOR and HER, respectively. Notably, the overall urea electrolysis system needs only 2.00 V to obtain 1500 mA cm&#8211;2, and it can operate stably for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2. This work illustrates the importance of regulating the adsorption energy of intermediates to design advanced catalysts for energy-efficient H2 production from urea electrolysis.</description>

Transition metals-doped noble electrocatalysts are commonly applied for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notwithstanding, most transition metal oxides are unstable under the conditions of acidic OER, questioning the real active sites on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Herein, RuMnOx is explored more than 30 % activity increased (at 1.7 V) after chronoamperometric activation measurement. The activities are improved when the chronoamperometric measurement potentials below 1.1 V. Coupling electrochemical measurements with Mn dissolution and Ru redeposition studies, we verify that the reconstruction of catalysts is responsible for the activated electrochemical activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the activity is enhanced by more hydroxyl adsorption on the surface, and the activated RuMnOx shows robust durability with a 0.027 mV/h potential increase rate for 2,600 h at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Hydrogen is currently recognized as being able to mitigate the overuse of fossil fuels and as a clean energy source in future development. In addition, water electrolysis can work with renewable energy sources to make the hydrogen cycle sustainable. However, hydrogen production efficiency from water electrolysis relies on efficient catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At present, in order to further develop overall water splitting (OWS) catalysts, non-metal doping has attracted increasing attention. Non-metals can modulate the electronic structure, lattice structure, and surface properties of transition metal-based catalysts, which can be a new strategy to regulate the catalytic activity. Herein, the recent research progresses of non-metallic doping in transition metal-based catalysts are reviewed in this paper. This article summarizes the inherent correlation between the electronic structure and local environmental changes of water electrolysis catalytic materials with different non-metallic elements in the transition metal-based materials. Then, the reasons and related mechanisms for the improved performance of catalysts by nonmetal doping are discussed. The aim of this review is to offer some insights in favour of the role that non-metallic doping owns special advantages in electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

      <title>Electrokinetic-mechanism of water and furfural oxidation on pulsed laser-interlaced Cu2O and CoO on nickel foam</title>

The electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived furfural (FF) feedstocks into 2-furoic acid (FA) holds immense industrial potential in optics, cosmetics, polymers, and food. Herein, we fabricated CoO/NiO/nickel foam (NF) and Cu2O/NiO/NF electrodes via in situ pulsed laser irradiation in liquids (PLIL) for the bifunctional electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and furfural oxidation reaction (FOR), respectively. Simultaneous oxidation of NF surface to NiO and deposition of CoO and/or Cu2O on NF during PLIL offer distinct advantages for enhancing both the OER and FOR. CoO/NiO/NF electrocatalyst provides a consistently low overpotential of &#8764;359 mV (OER) at 10 mA/cm2, achieving the maximum FA yield (&#8764;16.37 mM) with 61.5% selectivity, 79.5% carbon balance, and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;90.1% during 2 h of FOR at 1.43 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Mechanistic pathway via in situ electrochemical-Raman spectroscopy on CoO/NiO/NF reveals the involvement of phase transition intermediates (NiOOH and CoOOH) as surface-active centers during electrochemical oxidation. The carbonyl carbon in FF is attacked by hydroxyl groups to form unstable hydrates that subsequently undergo further oxidation to yield FA products. This method holds promise for large-scale applications, enabling simultaneous production of renewable building materials and fuel.</description>

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is proposed as an exemplary half-reaction in renewable energy applications because of its low thermodynamical potential. However, challenges persist due to sluggish reaction kinetics and complex by-products separation. To this end, we introduce the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), propelling a novel UOR route using a modified CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst termed CFRO-7. Theoretical calculations and in-situ characterizations highlight the activated lattice oxygen (OL) within CFRO-7 as pivotal sites for UOR, optimizing the reaction pathway and accelerating the kinetics. For the urea overall electrolysis application, the LOM route only requires a low voltage of 1.54 V to offer a high current of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for long-term utilization (&gt;48 h). Importantly, the by-product NCO&#8722; is significantly suppressed, while the CO2/N2 separation is efficiently achieved. This work proposed a pioneering paradigm, invoking the LOM pathway in urea electrolysis to expedite reaction dynamics and enhance product selectivity.</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Fe&#8722;N bonds induced highly efficient Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.133158</link>

Fe-based catalysts with the merits of the most abundant reserves in the crust, cheapest, and low toxicity, show significant superiorities to noble-metal catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting. Fe3O4 as a member of Fe-based catalysts has been widely used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it is rarely applied for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to the lack of inherent active sites for hydrogen absorption. Fe&#8722;N coordination bonds can act as active sites for electrocatalytic performance. Therefore, we reasonably designed and constructed Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction, where abundant Fe&#8722;N bonds acting as HER active sites were formed with the aid of rich Pyridine N of g-C3N4. Activity characterization result indicates the optimized 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction exhibits excellent HER performance with a low overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA cm-2, a low Tafel slope of 78 mV dec-1, and outstanding cycle stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance stems from the Fe&#8722;N bonding interaction, which endows 50%-Fe3O4/g-C3N4 with lower water dissociation barrier and a moderate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*) in comparison with pristine Fe3O4 and g-C3N4.</description>

Abstract Sodium&#8208;oxygen battery has attracted tremendous interest due to its extraordinary theoretical specific energy (1605 Wh kg &#8722;1 NaO2 ) and appealing element abundance. However, definite mechanistic factors governing efficient oxygen diffusion and consumption inside electrolyte&#8208;flooded air cathodes remain elusive and thus precluding a true gas diffusion electrode capable of high discharge current (i.e., several mA cm &#8722;2 ) and superior output power. Herein, we adopted 3D&#8208;printing technology to create gas channels with tailored channel size and structure to demystify the diffusion&#8208;limited oxygen delivery process. It is revealed that as the clogging discharging products increase, large channel size and interconnected channel structure are essential to guaranteeing fast O 2 diffusion. Moreover, to further encourage O 2 diffusion, a bio&#8208;inspired breathable cathode with progressively branching channels that balances between O 2 passage and reaction is 3D printed. This elaborated 3D electrode allows a sodium&#8208;oxygen cell to deliver an impressive discharging current density up to 4 mA cm &#8722;2 and an output power of 8.4 mW cm &#8722;2 , giving rise to an outstanding capacity of 18.4 mAh cm &#8722;2 . The unraveled mystery of oxygen delivery enabled by 3D printing points to a valuable roadmap for the rational design of metal&#8208;air batteries towards practical applications.

Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

      <title>Atomically dispersed catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical water splitting: from catalyst design, performance to catalytic mechanism</title>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Meticulous tuning of nonprecious catalysts for overall water splitting is highly challenging but it is one of the most promising routes toward the future hydrogen economy. Here, we present a highly active, robust and earth abundant NiCoP electrocatalyst with a tuning capacity to excel in both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The composition of Ni and Co has been varied in a facile two-step method to produce coral-like NiCoP. The variant Ni0.25Co0.75 P has shown remarkable OER activity with overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and Tafel slope of 68 mVdec-1 in alkaline medium. On the other hand, Ni0.75Co0.25P exhibited commendable HER performance with an overpotential of 120 mV and a Tafel slope of 123 mVdec-1 in an acid medium. Long-term durability and minimal loading of the catalyst ascertain the significance of the present catalyst. Moreover, our theoretical study finds that NiCoP provides a much higher electron density of d-states near the Fermi level compared to the individual metal phosphide and the low-index surface (100) of composite phosphide has a moderate level of desorption energy of oxygen and hydrogen compared to that of NiP2 &amp; CoP corroborating the superiority of NiCoP in OER/HER performance.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

      <title>General Method to Introduce &#960;-Electrons into Oxygen-Doped Porous Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Toluene Oxidation</title>

&#960;-Electrons have been successfully connected to an oxygen-doped porous carbon nitride by one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, ethanol, and 4-iodobenzaldehyde (IBD) in the atmosphere. The resulting COCN20 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen production up to 6.88 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with a relatively high apparent quantum efficiency (20.6% at 325 nm) as well as toluene oxidation with an outstanding conversion rate of 3.75 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 under 460 nm irradiation. Other &#960;-electrons from aromatic heterocycles could also be grafted to the network for the general synthesis, demonstrating higher hydrogen evolution rates (e.g., 9.32 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with the thiophene-&#960;-electrons coupling). The enhanced n &#8594; &#960;* electron transition and activated midgap states are found to extend the light-responsive region and improve the capture of effective electrons, while the novel porous architecture encourages the efficient mass-transfer rate and improves light harvesting. This work showcases a straightforward and scalable approach to fabricate immensely proficient photocatalysts composed of porous carbon nitride. Furthermore, it opens up a novel pathway for the methodical development and production of sophisticated photocatalysts that harness the powerful synergistic effects achieved by simultaneously adjusting and refining the electronic, surface, and molecular structures.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of a highly active &#946;-PbO2-Co3O4 electrode for zinc electrowinning by pulse electrodeposition: Characterization and catalytic performance analysis</title>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Meticulous tuning of nonprecious catalysts for overall water splitting is highly challenging but it is one of the most promising routes toward the future hydrogen economy. Here, we present a highly active, robust and earth abundant NiCoP electrocatalyst with a tuning capacity to excel in both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The composition of Ni and Co has been varied in a facile two-step method to produce coral-like NiCoP. The variant Ni0.25Co0.75 P has shown remarkable OER activity with overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and Tafel slope of 68 mVdec-1 in alkaline medium. On the other hand, Ni0.75Co0.25P exhibited commendable HER performance with an overpotential of 120 mV and a Tafel slope of 123 mVdec-1 in an acid medium. Long-term durability and minimal loading of the catalyst ascertain the significance of the present catalyst. Moreover, our theoretical study finds that NiCoP provides a much higher electron density of d-states near the Fermi level compared to the individual metal phosphide and the low-index surface (100) of composite phosphide has a moderate level of desorption energy of oxygen and hydrogen compared to that of NiP2 &amp; CoP corroborating the superiority of NiCoP in OER/HER performance.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

&#960;-Electrons have been successfully connected to an oxygen-doped porous carbon nitride by one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, ethanol, and 4-iodobenzaldehyde (IBD) in the atmosphere. The resulting COCN20 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen production up to 6.88 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with a relatively high apparent quantum efficiency (20.6% at 325 nm) as well as toluene oxidation with an outstanding conversion rate of 3.75 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 under 460 nm irradiation. Other &#960;-electrons from aromatic heterocycles could also be grafted to the network for the general synthesis, demonstrating higher hydrogen evolution rates (e.g., 9.32 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with the thiophene-&#960;-electrons coupling). The enhanced n &#8594; &#960;* electron transition and activated midgap states are found to extend the light-responsive region and improve the capture of effective electrons, while the novel porous architecture encourages the efficient mass-transfer rate and improves light harvesting. This work showcases a straightforward and scalable approach to fabricate immensely proficient photocatalysts composed of porous carbon nitride. Furthermore, it opens up a novel pathway for the methodical development and production of sophisticated photocatalysts that harness the powerful synergistic effects achieved by simultaneously adjusting and refining the electronic, surface, and molecular structures.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

      <title>Regulating Ru&#8208;O Bonding Interactions by Ir Doping Boosts the Acid Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

      <title>Atomically dispersed catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical water splitting: from catalyst design, performance to catalytic mechanism</title>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Meticulous tuning of nonprecious catalysts for overall water splitting is highly challenging but it is one of the most promising routes toward the future hydrogen economy. Here, we present a highly active, robust and earth abundant NiCoP electrocatalyst with a tuning capacity to excel in both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The composition of Ni and Co has been varied in a facile two-step method to produce coral-like NiCoP. The variant Ni0.25Co0.75 P has shown remarkable OER activity with overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and Tafel slope of 68 mVdec-1 in alkaline medium. On the other hand, Ni0.75Co0.25P exhibited commendable HER performance with an overpotential of 120 mV and a Tafel slope of 123 mVdec-1 in an acid medium. Long-term durability and minimal loading of the catalyst ascertain the significance of the present catalyst. Moreover, our theoretical study finds that NiCoP provides a much higher electron density of d-states near the Fermi level compared to the individual metal phosphide and the low-index surface (100) of composite phosphide has a moderate level of desorption energy of oxygen and hydrogen compared to that of NiP2 &amp; CoP corroborating the superiority of NiCoP in OER/HER performance.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

      <title>General Method to Introduce &#960;-Electrons into Oxygen-Doped Porous Carbon Nitride for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Toluene Oxidation</title>

&#960;-Electrons have been successfully connected to an oxygen-doped porous carbon nitride by one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, ethanol, and 4-iodobenzaldehyde (IBD) in the atmosphere. The resulting COCN20 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen production up to 6.88 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with a relatively high apparent quantum efficiency (20.6% at 325 nm) as well as toluene oxidation with an outstanding conversion rate of 3.75 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 under 460 nm irradiation. Other &#960;-electrons from aromatic heterocycles could also be grafted to the network for the general synthesis, demonstrating higher hydrogen evolution rates (e.g., 9.32 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with the thiophene-&#960;-electrons coupling). The enhanced n &#8594; &#960;* electron transition and activated midgap states are found to extend the light-responsive region and improve the capture of effective electrons, while the novel porous architecture encourages the efficient mass-transfer rate and improves light harvesting. This work showcases a straightforward and scalable approach to fabricate immensely proficient photocatalysts composed of porous carbon nitride. Furthermore, it opens up a novel pathway for the methodical development and production of sophisticated photocatalysts that harness the powerful synergistic effects achieved by simultaneously adjusting and refining the electronic, surface, and molecular structures.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Highly active and durable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desired for the application of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Herein, a robust 2D Aza-based Co3(HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline)2 metal-organic framework (MOF) with high catalytic activity and durability for the acidic OER with significant advancement in clean energy technology is demonstrated which opens up the new possibilities for improving the efficiency and sustainability of various electrochemical processes, contributing to the broader goal of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This novel 2D Aza-base MOF displays an extremely high conductivity of 8385.7 S/m with a vertically sharp increase in anodic current observed at an onset potential (Eonset) of 1434 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating an outstanding performance in the acidic medium (pH &lt; 2). The as-prepared Co3(HADQ)2 MOF is highly stable in acidic conditions and can act as a model catalyst to gain a deep understand the deep mechanism of acidic OER due to its well-defined and tunable structure, which is also confirmed by using density functional theory (DFT).</description>

Binder-free nickel sulfide material grown on NF (NiS/NF) by a basic thermal sulfur growth mechanic was employed as both the electrode material and electrode substrate for water oxidation in 1.0 M KOH. In NiS/NF, sulfur was found to be an activator to transform nickel sulfide to nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide. A transmission electron microscopy image of NiS/NF inferred that the oxide/(oxy)hydroxyl layer was found to be amorphous in nature. The energized NiS/NF electrocatalyst showed superior activity in oxygen evolution (OER) at 1.0 M KOH with a minimum overpotential (&#951;) of 290 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a water-splitting device was fabricated by using a photovoltaic solar panel to split water at 1.54 V. Our observation could offer important insight into metal-chalcogenide (M-S) electrocatalysts for low-cost oxygen evolution.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Meticulous tuning of nonprecious catalysts for overall water splitting is highly challenging but it is one of the most promising routes toward the future hydrogen economy. Here, we present a highly active, robust and earth abundant NiCoP electrocatalyst with a tuning capacity to excel in both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. The composition of Ni and Co has been varied in a facile two-step method to produce coral-like NiCoP. The variant Ni0.25Co0.75 P has shown remarkable OER activity with overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density and Tafel slope of 68 mVdec-1 in alkaline medium. On the other hand, Ni0.75Co0.25P exhibited commendable HER performance with an overpotential of 120 mV and a Tafel slope of 123 mVdec-1 in an acid medium. Long-term durability and minimal loading of the catalyst ascertain the significance of the present catalyst. Moreover, our theoretical study finds that NiCoP provides a much higher electron density of d-states near the Fermi level compared to the individual metal phosphide and the low-index surface (100) of composite phosphide has a moderate level of desorption energy of oxygen and hydrogen compared to that of NiP2 &amp; CoP corroborating the superiority of NiCoP in OER/HER performance.</description>

Slow water dissociation (the Volmer step) is the rate-limiting step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which limits the efficient industrial production of clean hydrogen. In this study, a novel hollow oxygen-rich vacancy polymetallic nitride, Co2NiMo-N, is proposed as a HER catalyst. The synergistic interaction between Co, Ni, and Mo promotes the Mo elemental activity and increases the conductivity of the material. The porous hollow structure exposes enough active sites to facilitate electron transfer. Numerous oxygen vacancies (OVs) reduced the Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH&#8270;) of H&#8270; adsorption and promoted the Volmer step, thus improving the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of the material. The Co2NiMo-N catalyst exhibited excellent HER activity with a low overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope of 77.58 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH.</description>

&#960;-Electrons have been successfully connected to an oxygen-doped porous carbon nitride by one-pot pyrolysis of the mixture of urea, ethanol, and 4-iodobenzaldehyde (IBD) in the atmosphere. The resulting COCN20 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen production up to 6.88 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with a relatively high apparent quantum efficiency (20.6% at 325 nm) as well as toluene oxidation with an outstanding conversion rate of 3.75 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 under 460 nm irradiation. Other &#960;-electrons from aromatic heterocycles could also be grafted to the network for the general synthesis, demonstrating higher hydrogen evolution rates (e.g., 9.32 mmol h&#8211;1 gcat&#8211;1 with the thiophene-&#960;-electrons coupling). The enhanced n &#8594; &#960;* electron transition and activated midgap states are found to extend the light-responsive region and improve the capture of effective electrons, while the novel porous architecture encourages the efficient mass-transfer rate and improves light harvesting. This work showcases a straightforward and scalable approach to fabricate immensely proficient photocatalysts composed of porous carbon nitride. Furthermore, it opens up a novel pathway for the methodical development and production of sophisticated photocatalysts that harness the powerful synergistic effects achieved by simultaneously adjusting and refining the electronic, surface, and molecular structures.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>
