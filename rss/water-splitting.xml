                Abstract The fabrication of nanostructured protein-inorganic hybrid materials is crucial for the development of advanced multifunctional materials. Protein-inorganic mesoporous composites are gaining attention due to their remarkable properties, including large surface areas and active surface functional groups. We have successfully synthesized mesoporous BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 catalysts to improve the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrocatalytic water splitting for sustainable energy generation. This approach utilizes BSA in the synthesis process and is environmentally friendly. By adjusting the BSA quantity, we could control the yield of BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 mesoporous. We employed various techniques, including FE-SEM, XRD, and FTIR, to analyze the morphology and structural characteristics of the biogenic BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 electrocatalyst. Our comprehensive evaluation of the electrocatalytic OER activity of the BSA/Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 hybrid structure demonstrated its remarkable performance. The biologically synthesized catalyst exhibited exceptional OER efficiency, maintaining a high current density of 10 mA cm-2 at very low overpotentials (only 224 mV) under alkaline conditions. The elongated peptide backbone of BSA significantly facilitated ion and electron transport, contributing to improved OER activity. The synergistic interaction between various amino acids from BSA and the metal ions within Zn3(PO4)2/Cr2O3 can be attributed to this enhancement, highlighting the potential of this hybrid structure in electrocatalytic OER applications.</description>

      <description>Zishuai Zhang, Daniela Vieira, Jake E. Barralet, G&#233;raldine Merle, Discover materials. 4(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400000753

                Abstract The development of efficient, low-cost water splitting electrocatalysts is needed to store energy by generating sustainable hydrogen from low power clean but intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind. Here, we report a highly sustained low overpotential for oxygen evolution reached by the unique combination of three metals (NiCoV) prepared from a simple low temperature auto-combustion process. The amorphous multimetal oxygen evolving catalyst could be stably coated on a stainless-steel support using a tribochemical particle blasting method to create an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode with a low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec &#8722;1 . In addition to their low overpotential, this oxygen evolving electrocatalyst preserved performance demonstrating a stability after 10 h at the technologically relevant current density and without any surface morphology alteration. Given the importance of sustainable hydrogen production, the development of this new OER catalyst points the way to removing a key technical bottleneck for the water splitting reaction and could offer a route to cost reduction and lowering hurdles to more widespread adaptation of electrolyser technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural Evolution Behaviors of Ligand&#8208;Defect&#8208;Rich Ferrocene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution via Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202400875</link>

                Abstract Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have exhibited encouraging catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial process for water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. Nonetheless, distinguishing the source of catalytic activity and establishing the structure&#8208;composition&#8208;property relationships of MOFs during OER processes remain challenging. Here, for the first time, operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is utilized to monitor the structural evolution and identify the active components of ferrocene&#8208;based MOFs (Ni&#8208;Fc) for OER. Ligand&#8208;defect&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;Fc is synthesized via the co&#8208;deposition method. After electrochemical activation, Ni&#8208;Fc exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity (228 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 0.1 m KOH), which is highly competitive compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Operando XAS analysis and ex&#8208;situ characterizations reveal the structural reconstruction of Ni&#8208;Fc into amorphous NiFe&#8208;catalysts (a&#8208;NiFe) during the activation process, and further into real catalytic phases (a&#8208;NiFe&#8208;C) under catalytic potential greater than 1.45 V (vs RHE). In catalytic phases, in&#8208;situ formed deprotonated and oxygen&#8208;defected Ni oxyhydroxide analogues act as catalytic sites, while Fe hydroxide analogues derived from ligands optimize the electronic structure of Ni sites for improving OER activity. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis indicates a reduced energy barrier in a&#8208;NiFe&#8208;C compared to pristine MOFs, supporting the improved catalytic activity of the latter.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen Doping-Induced Structural Distortion in LaMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Enhances Oxygen Reduction and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c01206</link>
      <description>Soumi Mondal, Shreya Sarkar, Mohd Riyaz, Manaswita Kar, Adrian C. Fortuin, Surishi Vashishth, Risov Das, M. Eswaramoorthy, Denis Kramer, Sebastian C. Peter, ACS energy letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400005916

                Nitrogen-doped perovskites (LaMnO3) were designed as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nitridation led to O-substitution in LaMnO3, creating distortion in the LaMnO3 structure and generating oxygen vacancies. N-doping facilitated an increase of Mn3+ content, enhancing ORR and OER activities. LaMnO3 with 4 h of nitridation exhibits 3.35 and 1.75 times higher specific and mass activities in comparison to pristine LaMnO3 (highest reported among perovskite oxides). The enhancement in catalytic activity is attributed to the increase of Mn3+ content and distorted Mn&#8211;O, leading to compressive strain. The substitution of N at the crystal lattice of perovskite stabilizes the intermediates through a combination of strain and charge modulation of the active Mn center, which causes the enhancement in ORR and OER performance. The bifunctional character of the catalyst was further evaluated for practical zinc&#8211;air battery applications in which nitrogen-doped LaMnO3 undergoes steady operation up to 500 cycles in harsh industrial conditions of 6 M KOH.</description>

      <title>Enthralling Anodic Protection by Molybdate on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst for Sustainable Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402720</link>
      <description>S. Khatun, K&#333;ji Shimizu, Santanu Kumar Pal, Sukumar Nandi, Satoshi Watanabe, Poulomi Roy, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400008057

                Abstract Efficient and sustainable seawater electrolysis is still limited due to the interference of chloride corrosion at the anode. The designing of suitable electrocatalysts is one of the crucial ways to boost electrocatalytic activity. However, the approach may fall short as achieving high current density often occurs in chlorine evolution reaction (CER)&#8208;dominating potential regions. Thereby, apart from developing an OER&#8208;active high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based electrocatalyst, the present study also offers a unique way to protect anode surface under high current density or potential by using MoO 4 2&#8212; as an effective inhibitor during seawater oxidation. The wide variation of d &#8208;band center of high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based electrocatalyst allows great oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proficiency exhibiting an overpotential of 230 mV at current density of 20 mA cm &#8722;2 . Besides, the electrocatalyst demonstrates impressive stability over 500 h at high current density of 1 A cm &#8722;2 or at a high oxidation potential of 2.0 V versus RHE in the presence of a molybdate inhibitor. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal MoO 4 2&#8208; electrostatically accumulated at anode surface due to higher adsorption ability, thereby creating a protective layer against chlorides without affecting OER.</description>

      <title>Toward Rational Design of Mononuclear Nickel Complexes as Water Oxidation Catalysts Exploring the Ligand Effects on the Rate&#8208;Determining Step</title>

                The major impediment in realizing a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen fuel economy is the cost and inadequacy of contemporary electrochemical water splitting approaches towards the energy intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The O&#8208;O bond formation in the water oxidation half&#8208;cell reaction is both kinetically and thermodynamically challenging and amplifies the overpotential requirement in most of the active water oxidation catalysts. Herein, density functional theory is employed to interrogate 20 Ni(II) complexes, out of which 17 are in silico designed molecular water oxidation catalysts, coordinated to electron&#8208;rich tetra&#8208;anionic redox non&#8208;innocent phenylenebis(oxamidate) and dibenzo&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;2,3,8,9&#8208;tetraone parent ligands and their structural analogues, and identify the role of substituent changes or ligand effects in the order of their reactivity. Importantly, our computational mechanistic analyses predict that the activation free energy of the rate&#8208;determining O&#8208;O bond formation step obeys an inverse scaling relationship with the global electrophilicity index of the intermediate generated on two&#8208;electron oxidation of the starting complex. Additionally, the driving force is directly correlated with this OER descriptor which enables two&#8208;dimensional volcano representation and thereby extrapolation towards the ideal substitution with the chosen ligand. Our study, therefore, establish fundamental insights to overcome the imperative overpotential issue with simple and precise computational rationalization preceding experimental validation.</description>

                Abstract Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

      <title>Reinforcing built-in electric field via weakening metal&#8211;oxygen covalency within MOFs-based heterointerface for robust oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Achieving enhanced built-in electric field (BEF) is highly desirable for accelerating charge transfer and boosting catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but still remains a huge challenge. Herein, we constructed the heterointerface composed of FeCo2S4 and CoFe-MOF with abundant oxygen vacancies on Ni foam substrate (named as FeCo2S4@Ov-CoFe-MOF/NF). Experimental and theoretical findings proposed that the introduction of abundant oxygen vacancies into the heterointerface could increase the energy level difference of the two components and reduce electron clouds overlap between metal Co/Fe and oxygen for increased BEF. Such enhanced BEF could accelerate the electronic migration for optimizing the d-band center and adsorption/desorption capacity of reaction intermediates. As expected, the target FeCo2S4@Ov-CoFe-MOF/NF with high BEF intensity displayed splendid OER activity and durability in the alkaline and neutral medium. The present work provides precise guidance for designing other advanced catalysts through deliberately manipulating the BEF.</description>

In this study, eco&#8208;friendly mechanochemical synthesis of perovskite metal oxide&#8208;carbon black composites is proposed using different conditions and additives such as KOH. Furthermore, the optimization of ball milling conditions, including time and rotational speed, is studied. The mechanochemical synthesis in solid&#8208;state conditions without additives produces electrocatalysts that exhibit the highest bifunctional electrochemical activity towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, this synthesis demonstrates a lower Environmental Impact Factor (E&#8208;factor), indicating its greener nature, and due to its simplicity, it has a great potential for scalability. The obtained bifunctional electrocatalysts have been tested in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) for 22 h with similar performance compared to the commercial catalyst (Pt/C) at significantly lower cost. These promising findings are attributed to the enhanced interaction between the perovskite metal oxide and carbon material and the improved dispersion of the perovskite metal oxide on the carbon materials.</description>

      <title>Integrating Multiphasic CuSx/FeSx Nanostructured Electrocatalyst for Enhanced Oxygen and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water Splitting</title>

                This study employed an electrodeposition approach to synthesize multiphasic CuSx and FeSx on nickel foam (NF) for application in saline water splitting. This multiphasic electrocatalyst exhibits a cauliflower morphology and develops a porous fused-type morphology upon partial oxidation. The NF/CuSx/FeSx electrode with partial oxidation exhibits the lowest overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 163 mV/decade for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overpotential of 73 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 165 mV/decade were found for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A charge transfer coefficient value of ~0.5 in OER and HER indicates that the rate-determining step depends on the surface adsorption of reaction species. The presence of an unpaired electron during partial oxidation can create additional active sites and reduce solution resistance (Rs). This can improve the interaction between reactants and intermediates, improving OER and HER performance. NF/CuSx/FeSx composites demonstrated robust stability using real seawater splitting over 80 hours in HER with negligible degradation. However, catalyst breakdown in OER after 10 hours due to prolonged exposure to higher potentials, resulting in oxidative corrosion. This study offers a multiphasic electrode design using the electrodeposition technique to produce green hydrogen energy through seawater splitting.</description>

                Bifunctional electrode materials are highly desirable for meeting increasing global energy demands and mitigating environmental impact. However, improving the atom-efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of storage systems, as well as optimizing conversion processes to enhance overall energy utilization and sustainability, remains a significant challenge for their application. Herein, we devised an optimized, facile, economic, and scalable synthesis of large area (cm2), ultrathin (&#8764;2.9 &#177; 0.3 nm) electroactive nanosheet of &#946;-Ni(OH)2, which acted as bifunctional electrode material for charge storage and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The &#946;-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet electrode shows the volumetric capacity of 2.82 Ah.cm&#8722;3(0.82 &#181;Ah.cm&#8722;2) at the current density of 0.2 mA.cm&#8722;2. The device shows a high capacity of 820 mAh.cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 0.33 Wh.cm&#8722;3 at 275.86 W.cm&#8722;3 along with promising stability (30,000 cycles). Furthermore, the OER activity of ultrathin &#946;-Ni(OH)2 exhibits an overpotential (&#951;10) of 308 mV and a Tafel value of 42 mV dec-1 suggesting fast reaction kinetics. The mechanistic studies are enlightened through density functional theory (DFT), which reveals that additional electronic states near the Fermi level enhance activity for both capacitance and OER.</description>

                Developing a non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalyst with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting is desirable for renewable energy systems. We developed a novel method to fabricate a heterostructured electrocatalyst, comprising a NiCoP nanoneedle array grown on Ti3C2Tx MXene-coated Ni foam (NCP-MX/NF) using a dip-coating hydrothermal method, followed by phosphorization. Due to the abundance of active sites, enhanced electronic kinetics, and sufficient electrolyte accessibility resulting from the synergistic effects of NCP and MXene, NCP-MX/NF bifunctional alkaline catalysts afford superb electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (72 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for HER and 303 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER), a low Tafel slope (49.2 mV dec&#8211;1 for HER and 69.5 mV dec&#8211;1 for OER), and long-term stability. Moreover, the overall water splitting performance of NCP-MX/NF, which requires potentials as low as 1.54 and 1.76 V at a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, exceeded the performance of the Pt/C&#8741;IrO2 couple in terms of overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the NCP/Ti3C2O2 interface model predicted the catalytic contribution to interfacial formation by analyzing the electronic redistribution at the interface. This contribution was also evaluated by calculating the adsorption energetics of the descriptor molecules (H2O and the H and OER intermediates).</description>

                Abstract Suppressing the kinetically favorable lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism pathway and triggering the adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway at the expense of activity are the state-of-the-art strategies for Ru-based electrocatalysts toward acidic water oxidation. Herein, atomically dispersed Ru species are anchored into an acidic stable vinyl-linked 2D covalent organic framework with unique crossed &#960;-conjugation, termed as COF-205-Ru. The crossed &#960;-conjugated structure of COF-205-Ru not only suppresses the dissolution of Ru through strong Ru-N motifs, but also reduces the oxidation state of Ru by multiple &#960;-conjugations, thereby activating the oxygen coordinated to Ru and stabilizing the oxygen vacancies during oxygen evolution process. Experimental results including X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ powder X-ray diffraction patterns, and theoretical calculations unveil the activated oxygen with elevated energy level of O 2 p band, decreased oxygen vacancy formation energy, promoted electrochemical stability, and significantly reduced energy barrier of potential determining step for acidic water oxidation. Consequently, the obtained COF-205-Ru displays a high mass activity with 2659.3 A g &#8722;1 , which is 32-fold higher than the commercial RuO 2 , and retains long-term durability of over 280 h. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously promote the stability and activity of Ru-based catalysts for acidic water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Octahedral Co2+-O-Co3+ in mixed cobalt spinel promotes active and stable acidic oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4530526/v1</link>

                Abstract Cobalt (Co)-based oxides show promising activity as precious metal-free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but the dissolution of Co has limited the durability of Co3O4 at industrially relevant current densities. This work demonstrates that cation in an octahedral coordination environment accounts for the oxygen evolution activity. Using a mixed inverse-normal phase spinel CoxGa(3-x)O4 as a proof-of-concept example, the designed Co2+-O-Co3+ motifs in octahedral sites trigger oxygen evolution through a kinetically favorable radical coupling pathway. Furthermore, lattice oxygen exchange, a leading factor in catalyst structural degradation for normal Co3O4, is suppressed, as evidenced by isotopic labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. With the optimized catalyst, Co1.8Ga1.2O4, we report an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm2, stable operation at 200 mA/cm2 for 200 hours in a three-electrode setup, and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer operating at 200 mA/cm2 for 450 hours.</description>

                Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly energy source that can be extracted from water through electrolysis. However, the slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side is the main obstacle to the widespread use of water-splitting devices. This study used self-developed highly porous nickel structures (SMNF) and commercial nickel foam (CNF) as working electrodes in the electrolysis process. Iron (II, III) Oxide (Fe 3 O 4 ) as a catalyst is coated with a dip coating technique on the Ni porous structure and then calcined using a laser process to produce a Ni-Fe 3 O 4 -based electrode. Electrochemical test results show that the presence of Fe 3 O 4 significantly impacts high reaction kinetics. The SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 demonstrated an overpotential of 217,3 mV at 1 M KOH electrolyte, at a current density of 10 mA, lower to SMNF electrode without Fe 3 O 4 with an overpotential of 361,4 mV under the same conditions. In addition, the difference in porosity less significantly affects the electrode's effectiveness due to the slight difference in mass loading, which is only &lt; 5 mg. However, electro-impedance spectroscopy (EIS) testing shows better performance on SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 with a smaller electrical series resistance (ESR), around 0.638 &#937;, compared to CNF-Fe 3 O 4 , which is 0.767 &#937;. Overall, observations by chronoamperometry test at an overpotential of 155 mV at 5 hrs show stable performance of SMNF-Fe 3 O 4 electrodes.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal sulfides (TMS) exhibit significant promise as non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments, notwithstanding their susceptibility to long&#8208;term instability due to the gradual leaching of surface&#8208;reconstructed sulfate ions (SO 4 2&#8722; ). In this study, a sulfate ion&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to stabilize the surface&#8208;reconstructed SO 4 2&#8722; of FeNiS 2 . The findings reveal that SO 4 2&#8722; experiences considerable loss in KOH due to the infinite concentration gradient of SO 4 2&#8722; on the surface. Conversely, in K 2 SO 4 /KOH, this strategy mitigates rapid leaching and preserves the predominant surface&#8208;reconstructed SO 4 2&#8722; , thereby enhancing stability in both accelerated degradation (5000 cycles) and long&#8208;term (&#8805;120 h) tests, with &#8776;95% current density retained. Furthermore, the optimal concentration of SO 4 2&#8722; proves to be crucial, as supported by both experimental and theoretical results. This approach offers insights into bolstering the long&#8208;term OER stability of TMS and similar compounds, thereby advancing the prospects for widespread application in electrocatalytic water splitting.</description>

                Designing and developing suitable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and stability remain challenging in electrolytic water splitting. Hence, NiFe@NC@MoS2 core-bishell composites wrapped by molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NC) were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis in this research. NiFe@NC@MoS2 composite exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 288mV and a Tafel slope of 53.2 mV&#183;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to commercial RuO2. NC and MoS2 bishells create profuse edge active sites that enhance the adsorption ability of OOH* while lowering the overall overpotential of the product and improving its oxygen precipitation performance. The density function theory(DFT) analysis confirms that the layered MoS2 in NiFe@NC@MoS2 provides additional edge active sites and enhances electron transfer, thus increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity. This research paves a novel way for developing OER electrocatalysts with excellent catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Accumulation for a Hydrophobic Cathode in Lean-Oxygen Seawater Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c07279</link>

                The unsatisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics caused by the inherent lean-oxygen marine environment brings low power density for metal-dissolved oxygen seawater batteries (SWBs). In this study, we propose a seawater/electrode interfacial engineering strategy by constructing a hydrophobic coating to realize enhanced mass transfer of dissolved oxygen for the fully immersed cathode of SWBs. Accumulation of dissolved oxygen from seawater to the catalyst is particularly beneficial for improving the ORR performance under lean-oxygen conditions. As a result, SWB assembled with a hydrophobic cathode achieved a power density of up to 2.32 mW cm&#8211;2 and sustained discharge at 1.3 V for 250 h. Remarkably, even in environments with an oxygen concentration of 4 mg L&#8211;1, it can operate at a voltage approximately 100 mV higher than that of an unmodified SWB. The introduction of a hydrophobic interface enhances the discharge voltage and power of SWBs by improving interfacial oxygen mass transfer, providing new insights into improving the underwater ORR performance for practical SWBs.</description>

                Abstract To address the substantial energy needs of the quickly evolving modern civilization, efforts are still needed to provide sustainable renewable energy sources. The electrocatalytic Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the essential technologies used in the various hydrogen production techniques. ZIF&#8208;67 nanocubes (ZIF&#8208;67 NCs) were synthesized in an aqueous solution and used as sacrificial templates. Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate was added under water bath conditions, resulting in the evolution of numerous small layered layers of cobalt hydroxide. This ultimately led to the formation of multilayered, three&#8208;dimensionally crosslinked Co&#8208;LDH with a porous networked cubic morphology. Hydrolysis of Co 2+ at different concentrations produces different degrees of weak acidic environments, and the loose LDH on the cubic structure of the best catalyst, Co&#8208;LDH&#8208;1, exposes more active cobalt sites for the OER, which results in a high electrochemically active surface area, with an overpotential of 354 mV and a Tafel slope of 79.06 mV dec &#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and good stability and low activation under alkaline condition also has good stability and low activation energy. It provides us an easy and practical plan for logically creating ZIF&#8208;derived hydroxide materials, leading to the development of affordable and effective electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>P&#8208;10.1: Design and Optimization of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Alucone Overlapping Film for Improved Water&#8208;Oxygen Barrier Performance of Flexible Displays</title>

                Thin&#8208;film encapsulation plays an essential role in the stability of flexible displays. Although Al 2 O 3 film has good water&#8208;oxygen barrier properties, its bending performance needs to be enhanced. This paper inserts Alucone into Al 2 O 3 film to generate Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film with good barrier and bending performance to improve the encapsulated devices. The finite element analyzing approach and the calcium dot arrays test are employed to investigate the influence of structural ratio and overlapping density on the water&#8208;oxygen barrier and mechanical properties of the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film. The results show that the proportion of Alucone sublayers in the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (with a total thickness of 60 nm) is directly proportional to the overlapping structure's ability to disperse stresses and inversely proportional to the overlapping structure's water&#8208;oxygen barrier property. When the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping structure ratio is 1:1, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film can balance the bending and barrier properties. The bending property of Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film (Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1, total thickness is 60 nm) diminishes with increasing overlapping density, and its water&#8208;oxygen barrier property increases and then drops. Combining the results of the simulation and calcium dot arrays test, it is apparent that when the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone ratio is 1:1 and the overlapping density is 5, the Al 2 O 3 /Alucone overlapping film has good bending and barrier performance. This is expected to promote the development of commercial flexible display technology.</description>

                Abstract Photocatalysis is a promising technique due to its capacity to efficiently harvest solar energy and its potential to address the global energy crisis. However, the structure&#8211;activity relationships of photocatalyst during wavelength-dependent photocatalytic reactions remains largely unexplored because it is difficult to measure under operating conditions. Here we show the photocatalytic strain evolution of a single Au nanoparticle (AuNP) supported on a TiO 2 film by combining three-dimensional (3D) Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging with an external light source. The wavelength-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has significant effects on the structural deformation of the AuNP, leading to its strain evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to rationalize the induced strain caused by the adsorption of ROS on the AuNP surface. These observations provide insights of how the photocatalytic activity impacts on the structural deformation of AuNP, contributing to the general understanding of the atomic-level catalytic adsorption process.</description>

                Nickel-based sulfides have been proven to be excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts due to their excellent electrical conductivity, but their poor stability hinders their application in practical applications. To address this issue, defect engineering has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance the electronic structure of the catalyst and further boost the OER performance. Herein, a MOF-derived Sn-doped NiS/Ni3S2 nanostructure grown in situ on nickel foam (Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF) has been designed as an active OER electrocatalyst. The morphology of the material was significantly impacted by the addition of the Sn elements, nanorods modified with nanoparticles providing more active sites. Moreover, the introduction of Sn elements induced the generation of sulfur vacancies (Vs), enhanced electron transfer, promoted electron redistribution, and increased the charge transfer rate. All of these endow the Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF-T with exceptionally low overpotentials of 104 and 286 mV to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER. Moreover, the Sn&#8211;NixSy/NF-T showed long-term stability, maintaining 100 h at current densities of 100 mA cm&#8211;2. In short, this work opened a route for engineering defects to boost the OER.</description>

                As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.</description>

                Chirality-induced spin selectivity observed in chiral 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite holds promise to achieve spin-dependent electrochemistry. However, conventional chiral 2D perovskites suffer from low conductivity and hygroscopicity, limiting electrochemical performance and operational stability. Here, a cutting-edge material design is introduced to develop a stable and efficient chiral perovskite-based spin polarizer by employing fluorinated chiral cation. The fluorination approach effectively promotes the charge carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction by mitigating the dielectric confinement effect within the multi-quantum well-structured 2D perovskite. Integrating the fluorinated cation incorporated spin polarizer with BiVO</description>

      <title>High-Valence Cu Induced by Photoelectric Reconstruction for Dynamically Stable Oxygen Evolution Sites</title>

                Oxygen vacancies are generally considered to play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the generation of active sites created by oxygen vacancies is inevitably restricted by their condensation and elimination reactions. To overcome this limitation, here, we demonstrate a novel photoelectric reconstruction strategy to incorporate atomically dispersed Cu into ultrathin (about 2&#8211;3 molecular) amorphous oxyhydroxide (a-CuM, M = Co, Ni, Fe, or Zn), facilitating deprotonation of the reconstructed oxyhydroxide to generate high-valence Cu. The in situ XAFS results and first-principles calculations reveal that Cu atoms are stabilized at high valence during the OER process due to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, resulting in para-type double oxygen vacancies as dynamically stable catalytic sites. The optimal a-CuCo catalyst exhibits a record-high mass activity of 3404.7 A g&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, superior to the benchmarking hydroxide and oxide catalysts. The developed photoelectric reconstruction strategy opens up a new pathway to construct in situ stable oxygen vacancies by high-valence Cu single sites, which extends the design rules for creating dynamically stable active sites.</description>

      <title>Programmable Wet-Interfacial Joule Heating to Rapidly Synthesize Metastable Protohematite Photoanodes: Metal and Lattice Oxygen Dual Sites for Improving Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02690</link>
      <description>Jiujun Deng, Guoqing Li, Dongpeng Yan, Wei Zhang, Kun Feng, Kaiqi Nie, Changhai Liu, Xiaoxin Lv, Jun Zhong, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400166207

                High-temperature sintering is critical for efficient hematite photoanodes in terms of improving the crystallinity and minimizing deficiencies. However, prolonged conventional furnace annealing requires high energy consumption and simultaneously results in serious damage to the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate. This work demonstrates a universal wet-interfacial Joule heating strategy for rapidly synthesizing high-performance metastable protohematite photoanodes, which greatly decreases the power consumption and causes less damage to the TCO substrate by shortening the sintering time to &#8764;90 s. More importantly, the protohematite phase was found to effectively facilitate the charge dynamics in the bulk and surface of the as-resulting photoanode by increasing donor density and lowering the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential via offering dual active sites (lattice oxygen and Fe sites). Moreover, this annealing strategy could be well coupled with commonly used Ti-treatment to achieve a further performance enhancement and also shows high feasibility in rapidly fabricating efficient TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes. This study opens a facile, rapid, and reliable approach for fabricating efficient metal oxide photoanodes, contributing to the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Designing cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting is a significant challenge. We have systematically investigated a series of quasi-2D oxides, LaSrMn0.5M0.5O4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the two half-reactions of water-splitting, namely oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The four materials are isostructural, as confirmed by Rietveld refinements with X-ray diffraction. The oxygen contents and metal valence states were determined by iodometric titrations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrical conductivity measurements in a wide range of temperatures revealed semiconducting behavior for all four materials. Electrocatalytic properties were studied for both half-reactions of water-splitting, namely, oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER). For the four materials, the trends in both OER and HER were the same, which also matched the trend in electrical conductivities. Among them, LaSrMn0.5Co0.5O4 showed the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER, which may be attributed to its higher electrical conductivity and favorable electron configuration.</description>

                Transition-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have attracted widespread attention due to their inexpensive prices, unique layered structures, and rich active sites. Currently, designing low-cost, sustainable, and simple synthesis methods is essential for the application of transition-metal-based catalysts. Here, magnetic field (MF)-assisted chemical corrosion, as a novel technology, is adopted to construct superior OER electrocatalysts. The produced Ni(Fe)(OH)2-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits an overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2, presenting a 64 mV reduction compared to the electrode without an MF. The experimental results indicate that an MF can induce the directional growth of Fe2O3 rods and reduce their accumulation. In addition, an external MF is beneficial for the lattice dislocation of the obtained catalysts, which can increase the surface free energy, thus reducing the activation energy and accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. This work effectively combines a magnetic field with chemical corrosion and electrochemical energy, which offers a novel strategy for the large-scale development of environmentally friendly and superior electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Doping transition metal oxide spinels with metal ions represents a significant strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Herein, a bimetallic Fe and Ru doping strategy to fine&#8208;tune the crystal structure of CoV 2 O 4 spinel for highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is presented performance. The incorporation of Fe and Ru is observed at octahedral sites within the CoV 2 O 4 structure, effectively modulating the electronic configuration of Co. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that Fe acts as a novel reactive site, replacing V. Additionally, the synergistic effect of Fe, Co, and Ru effectively optimizes the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate species, reduces the reaction energy barrier, and accelerates the kinetics toward OER. As expected, the best&#8208;performing CoVFe 0.5 Ru 0.5 O 4 displays a low overpotential of 240 mV (@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and a remarkably low Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec &#8722;1 , surpassing that of commercial RuO 2 . Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding long&#8208;term durability lasting for 72 h. This study provides valuable insights for the design of highly active polymetallic spinel electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.</description>

                Despite the challenges associated with the synthesis of flexible metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), these offer the unique advantage of maximizing the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the construction of flexible MCOFs with flexible building units or linkages has rarely been reported. In this study, novel flexible MCOFs are constructed using flexible building blocks and copper clusters with hydrazone linkages. The heterometallic frameworks (Cu, Co) are prepared through the hydrazone linkage coordination method and evaluated as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the spatial separation and functional cooperation of the heterometallic MCOF catalysts, the as-synthesized MCOFs exhibited outstanding catalytic activities with an overpotential of 268.8 mV at 10 mA cm</description>

                Abstract This study investigates the environmentally friendly synthesis of ZrO 2 &#8208;NdO mixed nanomaterial using green reducing and capping agents derived from the plant Amaranthus viridis . X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of the mixed nanomaterial, revealing an optical band gap of 2.5 eV. The morphology was characterized by spherical&#8208;shaped particles with an average size ranging from 66 to 77 nm. The synthesized ZrO 2 &#8208;NdO mixed nanomaterial was evaluated for its potential application as an electrode material in energy devices, specifically for pseudocapacitors and water splitting studies. Electrochemical performance was assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge (GCD) techniques. Notably, a specific capacitance of 573.5 F/g was achieved through CV at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Fabricated electrocatalyst was further analyzed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the results showed better over potential value of 164 mV for HER studies. The stability analysis further endorsed the large&#8208;scale commercialization possibility of ZrO&#8208;NdO&#8208;based electrode material.</description>

      <title>Cs-Doped WO3 with Enhanced Conduction Band for Efficient Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Driven by Long-Wavelength Visible Light</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29133126</link>
      <description>Dong Liu, Siyu Tian, Qi Qian, Caiyun Gao, Hongfang Shen, Fei Han, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400201450

                Cesium doped WO3 (Cs-WO3) photocatalyst with high and stable oxidation activity was successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using Cs2CO3 as the doped metal ion source and tungstic acid (H2WO4) as the tungsten source. A series of analytical characterization tools and oxygen precipitation activity tests were used to compare the effects of different additions of Cs2CO3 on the crystal structure and microscopic morphologies. The UV&#8211;visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of Cs-doped material exhibited a significant red shift in the absorption edge with new shoulders appearing at 440&#8211;520 nm. The formation of an oxygen vacancy was confirmed in Cs-WO3 by the EPR signal, which can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst surface and contribute to improving the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The photocatalytic OER results showed that the Cs-WO3-0.1 exhibited the optimal oxygen precipitation activity, reaching 58.28 &#181;mol at 6 h, which was greater than six times higher than that of WO3-0 (9.76 &#956;mol). It can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the increase in the conduction band position of Cs-WO3-0.1 (0.11 V) and oxygen vacancies compared to WO3-0, which accelerate the electron conduction rate and slow down the rapid compounding of photogenerated electrons&#8211;holes, improving the water-catalytic oxygen precipitation activity of WO3.</description>

                Abstract In this work, self&#8208;derivation and surface reconstruction strategies are innovatively introduced into the synthetic route of the metal complex&#8208;derived catalysts. The in situ grown nanorod arrays of Ni&#8208;based complex are prepared by a simple self&#8208;derivation and rapid ligand chelation reaction. Furthermore, highly active heterogeneous electrocatalysts are developed by mild&#8208;temperature calcination. Attributed to the maintained morphology and highly dispersed Ni/Ni(OH) 2 heterojunction active sites, the as&#8208;prepared electrode exhibits superior hydrogen evolution activity (38.4 mV&#8211;10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). In particular, the dynamic reconstruction during oxygen evolution through in situ Fourier transform infrared and in situ Raman spectroscopies are observed. The reconstructed Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH by activation gives the electrode higher oxygen evolution performance (369 mV&#8211;200 mA cm &#8722;2 ). Further density functional theory mechanism studies disclose that Ni/Ni(OH) 2 contributes to the adsorption of H* in hydrogen evolution and the activated Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH optimizes the formation of intermediates in oxygen evolution.</description>

                Recognizing the essential factor governing interfacial hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is central to electrocatalytic water-splitting. Traditional strategies aiming at enhancing electrocatalytic activities have mainly focused on manipulating active site valencies or coordination environments. Herein, the role of interfacial adsorption is probed and modulated by the topological construct of the electrocatalyst, a frequently underestimated non-Faradaic mechanism in the dynamics of electrocatalysis.

                Mixed metal oxides (MMOs) are a promising class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite their importance for sustainable energy schemes, our understanding of relevant reaction pathways, catalytically active sites, and synergistic effects is rather limited. Here, we applied synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the evolution of the amorphous Co-Cu-W MMO electrocatalyst, shown previously to be an efficient bifunctional OER and HER catalyst for water splitting. Ex situ XAS measurements provided structural environments and the oxidation state of the metals involved, revealing Co</description>

The reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONs) of the APPJ modify the surface properties, chemical bonding types, and oxidation states of the material at the self-sustained temperature of the APPJ. The APPJ treatment further enhances the hydrophilicity and creates a higher disorder level in the carbon material. Moreover, the metal carbide bonds of NiFe/CP formed in the electrochemical deposition (ED) process are converted to metal oxide bonds after APPJ processing. The potential application of APPJ treatment on NiFe/CP in alkaline water electrolysis is demonstrated. With more oxygen-containing species and better hydrophilicity after APPJ treatment, APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is applied as the electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis. APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is also used in a custom-made anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE); this should contribute toward realizing the practical large-scale application of AEM for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Insights on Water of Crystallization in Autologous Cobalt Phosphates for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>

                Cobalt phosphates are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the rate-determining step in water splitting. However, the role of water crystallization in OER electrocatalysis is not well understood, limiting the systematic design of such catalysts. This study compares Co3(PO4)2&#183;4H2O (CoPO-25) and Co3(PO4)2 (CoPO-25NW) nanoflakes to highlight the importance of water of crystallization. The results show that water of crystallization increases the oxygen vacancy concentration, enhances electrical conductivity, and modifies electronic structure, leading to higher catalytic activity for CoPO-25. Additionally, the water of crystallization sustains the structural stability of CoPO-25, preventing complete hydroxylation conversion. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the water of crystallization in CoPO-25 is crucial for modifying binding interactions between reaction intermediates and the catalyst. This study not only presents a promising electrocatalyst but also provides insights into the impact of water crystallization in cobalt phosphates on the OER.</description>

      <title>Constructing Conductive MoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; Thin Films by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition</title>

                Herein, we construct amorphous molybdenum oxide films by thermal atomic layer deposition (T&#8208;ALD) and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE&#8208;ALD). The physical and chemical properties of molybdenum oxide films prepared by the two methods were systematically compared by means of film growth law, atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope etc. The results show that the amorphous molybdenum oxide physical phase prepared by both atomic layer deposition methods is MoO 3 . Compared with T&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the growth rate of MoO 3 thin films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD is higher. Compared to PE&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the MoO 3 films prepared by T&#8208;ALD did not have nucleation delayed to a laminar growth mode, resulting in smoother deposited films and contained less impurity carbon. The MoO 3 prepared by PE&#8208;ALD contains 7.4% impurity carbon. This carbon&#8208;doped film significantly improves the conductivity of the MoO 3 film and shows good electrochemical activity. As expected, the MoO 3 films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential was only 259 mV at 10 mA cm &#8208;2 and continued to evolution oxygen for 60 h with almost no attenuation, indicating that carbon doping significantly improves the catalytic intrinsic activity and stability of MoO 3 .

                Amorphous structure shows more catalytic active sites but poor conductivity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we fabricated a novel three-dimensional (3D) self-supported NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) catalytic material with amorphous/ crystalline interface, aiming to obtain both excellent catalytic activity and conductivity. This homogeneous hierarchical structure exhibits a high catalytic activity and robustness, giving the industrially required current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at an ultralow overpotential of 359.8 mV with 240-hour stability in 1 M KOH. In-situ electrochemical tests reveal that the amorphous/crystalline interface boosts the intermediates evolution and OER kinetics, which might be ascribed to considerable active sites and fast charge transfer. Moreover, the 3D structure has unique superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity, which can further accelerate the electrolyte penetration, facilitate the bubbles desorption from the electrode, enhance mass transport, and thus improve OER performance at large current densities. This work provides a feasible way to develop high-performance electrocatalytic material via constructing homogeneous amorphous/crystalline interface.</description>

                Titanium (Ti) is widely used as anode current collectors in proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolyzers due to its self-passivated oxide layer, which protects it from corrosion in acidic solutions. However, the cost of the material and machining process for Ti is high. A wider utilization of water electrolyzers to produce hydrogen could be favored by the use of less expensive coated aluminum (Al) substrates, which could potentially replace high-cost Ti-based components. It is shown here by depositing a pinhole-free oxygen vacancy-rich titanium oxide (TiOx) protection layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD), the corrosion resistance of Al substrates in acidic environments at oxygen evolution potentials can be enhanced. The optimization of the oxygen vacancy concentration is accomplished by tuning the ALD parameters to achieve ideal stoichiometry and conformal coating on rough substrates. The robustness of the coatings was evaluated at high potentials (2.4 V vs NHE = normal hydrogen electrode) in low pH conditions. A low TiOx dissolution rate of the order of &#8764;6 nm year&#8211;1 was observed. By testing under industrially relevant conditions, i.e., high applied voltages (2.4 V) and low pH, an Al loss at around the zero ppb level was achieved using optimized ALD parameters. It is proposed that a 40 nm TiOx coating on Al may be adequate to provide 60,000 h of durability in a PEM water electrolyzer anode current collector.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Key Factors Governing O2 Evolution upon Charging a Reversible LiOH-based Nonaqueous Li-O2 Battery</title>

                Abstract Achieving a highly reversible 4e&#8722;/O2 oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential yet highly challenging task for nonaqueous LiOH-based Li-O2 batteries, as the kinetically sluggish OER tend to entangle with competing parasitic reactions, whose origins unfortunately remain largely elusive. Here we construct a highly reversible LiOH-based Li-O2 battery using FeCoNi LDH catalysts and tetramethylene sulfone electrolytes. We show that the decomposition of LiOH toward O2 evolution involves the formation of *OH, *HO2&#8722; and *H2O2 species but no 1O2. The electrophilic attack of the electrolyte by *OH and the carbon corrosion by LiOH at potentials beyond 3.5 V are primary causes of the irreversibility. We demonstrate that these side reactions can be considerably suppressed by optimizing the solvent | catalyst | electrical conductor interfaces. Our work highlights key strategies for promoting reversible LiOH decomposition via the 4e&#8722;/O2 OER, paving the ways towards long-life LiOH-based nonaqueous Li-O2 batteries.</description>

                Abstract An urgent challenge to the development of rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (RZABs) is the highly active, durable, and low&#8208;cost catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER). Herein, a carbon&#8208;based monolithic catalyst is designed via anchoring P&#8208;modified MnCo 2 O 4 inverse spinel nanoparticles on biomass&#8208;derived carbon (P&#8208;MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC). The introduction of surface P atoms regulates the electronic structures and valences of metal atoms by adjusting the coordination fields by (P&#8208;O) &#948;&#8211; and Metal&#8208;P. The optimization of the adsorption behavior of key intermediates facilitates the activation and conversion of reaction species. The monolithic structure is beneficial to the construction of a three&#8208;phase interface for efficient mass transfer and high electrical conductivity. The P&#8208;MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC catalyst displays outstanding bifunctional catalytic properties with a thin &#916; E (the difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm &#8211; 2 and the ORR halfwave potential) of 0.66 V. The RZAB with P&#8208;MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC as cathode delivers an exceptional peak power density (160 mW cm &#8211; 2 ) and remarkable cycle life (over 1200 cycles), overcoming those with noble metal counterparts. This research provides a promising general surface&#8208;phosphorization way to the design of carbon electrocatalysts and the high&#8208;value utilization of biomass.</description>

      <title>Recent Development of Transition Metal&#8208;based Amorphous Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400564</link>

                Electrochemical water splitting, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a promising hydrogen production technology. However, in practice, the high overpotentials and sluggish reaction kinetics associated with the anode OER process are the major obstacles to the smooth progress of electrocatalytic water splitting. Amorphous electrocatalysts, a crucial family of functional materials, exhibit unexpected performance due to their special short&#8208;range ordered and long&#8208;range disordered atom arrangement, abundant defect sites and adjustable composition. To date, while numerous recent publications showcase promising results for transition metal&#8208;based amorphous electrocatalysts, including amorphous metal phosphide and metal hydroxide electrocatalysts with remarkable HER and OER properties respectively, the utilization of single&#8208;function HER or OER catalysts tends to augment system complexity for water electrolysis, thereby escalating the cost of hydrogen production. In this regard, amorphous HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts are desired. In this review, we summarize the recent development on transition metal&#8208;based amorphous catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. The design strategies for constructing HER/OER bifunctional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based amorphous electrocatalysts are highlighted here, also including the exploration of relationship between catalyst structures and their remarkably improved performance. Finally, the possibilities of amorphous bifunctional catalysts for practical industrial applications are evaluated and future research direction are suggested.</description>

                ABSTRACT Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) as power generators and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) as hydrogen fuel producers play critical roles in implementing hydrogen energy. The bipolar plates (BPPs) in both PEMFC and PEMWE facilitate the distribution of reactants and products, providing electrical connectivity in a series of singular cells. Although both systems are categorized under the same PEM spectrum, the differing reaction mechanisms require specialized plate properties to achieve optimum performance. This short review analyzes the characteristics of BPPs in both PEMFC and PEMWE, with a focus on the plate material, coating, and flow field. This short review concluded that the polymer composite graphite&#8211;based BPPs are the most feasible for PEMFC with no coating needed. PEMWE needs SS316 as a BPP material with a conductive coating to withstand the highly corrosive oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. The serpentine flow field showed dominance in PEMFC stack performance due to even fluid distribution and efficient liquid water drainage. However, its high&#8208;pressure drop contributes to greater parasitic power. PEMWEs commonly adopt the parallel flow field for its lower contact resistance and bubble formation for efficient mass transport toward the cathode.</description>

                The endeavor to architect bifunctional electrocatalysts that exhibit both exceptional activity and durability heralds an era of boundless potential for the comprehensive electrolysis of seawater, an aspiration that, nevertheless, poses a substantial challenge. Within this work, we describe the precise engineering of a three-dimensional interconnected nanoparticle system named SCdoped Co2VO4/CoP (SCCo2VO4), achieved through a meticulously arranged hydrothermal treatment sequence followed by gas-phase carbonization and phosphorization. The resulting SCCo2VO4 electrode exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic stability, attributed to the strategic anionic doping and abundant heterogeneous interfaces. Doping not only adjusts the electronic structure, enhancing electron transfer efficiency but also optimizes the surface-active sites. This electrode prodigiously necessitated an extraordinarily minimal overpotential of merely 92 and 350 mV to attain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH solution. Noteworthily, when integrated into an electrolyzer for the exhaustive splitting of seawater, the SCP-Co2VO4 manifested an exceptionally low cell voltage of 2.08 V@50 mA cm&#8722;2 and showcased a durability that eclipses that of most hitherto documented nickel-based bifunctional materials. Further elucidation through Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses underscored that anion doping and the inherent heterostructure adeptly optimize the Gibbs free energy of intermediates comprising hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen (manifested as OH, O, OOH) within the HER and OER paradigms, thus propelling the electrochemical kinetics of seawater splitting to unprecedented velocities. These revelations unfurl a pioneering design philosophy for the creation of cost-effective yet superior catalysts aimed at the holistic division of water molecules, charting a course towards the realization of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production methodologies.</description>

                The sluggishness of the complementary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reckoned as one of the major drawbacks in developing an energy-efficient green hydrogen-producing electrolyzer. An array of organic molecule oxidation reactions, operational at a relatively low potential, have been explored as a substitute for the OER. Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) has emerged as a leading alternative in this context. Additionally, the GOR generates several value-added organic compounds following oxidation that enhance the cost viability of the overall electrolysis reaction. In this study, a low-cost, room temperature operable, and energy-efficient synthetic methodology has been developed to generate unique two-dimensional CuO nanosheets (CuO NS). This CuO NS material was embedded on a carbon paper electrode, which showcased excellent glycerol electro-oxidation performance operational at a moderately low applied potential. Formic acid is the major product of this CuO NS-driven GOR (Faradaic efficiency ~80%), as it is formed primarily via the glyceraldehyde oxidation pathway. This CuO NS material was also active for oxidizing other abundant alcohols like ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, albeit at a relatively poor efficiency. Therefore, this robust CuO NS material has displayed the potential to be used in large-scale electrolyzers functioning with HER/GOR reactions.</description>

                Abstract Due to the prevailing energy shortages, the quest for new alternative energy sources is growing increasingly urgent. Hydrogen production through water electrolysis has become a crucial method. However, the slow four-electron reaction in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes the main rate-limiting step. In this study, we propose obtaining heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P after composite phosphatisation using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate material. The experimental results demonstrate that the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO exhibits an overpotential of 365mV at a current density of 10mA/cm2 , and displays a Tafel slope value of 114.02mF/dec, a bilayer capacitance of 1.853mF/cm2 for OER in a 1 M KOH solution. After phosphating, the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with only 215 mV overpotential, a Tafel slope value of 79.36 mV/dec, and a bilayer capacitance of 34.73mF/cm2 at a current density of 10mA/cm2 . Moreover, it also exhibits relatively stable performance during cyclic voltammetry testing for up to1000 cycles. Analyses suggest that the formation of a heterojunction structure in La(OH)3@CuO-P effectively addresses the issues of insufficient conductivity of La(OH)3 and tendency for CuO monomer aggregation while maintaining excellent properties for each component. The substitutional P atom doping not only adjusts the electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption free energy of -OH but also reduces sample size and increases catalytic active sites, thereby further enhancing the OER performance of the material.</description>

                Abstract Rapid synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) offers new opportunities to develop functional materials in widespread applications. Although some methods have successfully produced HEA NPs, these methods generally require rigorous conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, restricted atmosphere and limited substrates, which impede practical viability. In this work, we report a laser solid-phase synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles by laser irradiation of mixed metal precursors on a laser-induced graphene (LIG) support with a 3D porous structure. The CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles are embraced by several graphene layers, forming graphene shell-encapsulated HEA nanoparticles. We provide an in-depth understanding of the laser solid-phase synthesis of HEA NPs on LIG supports by simulation and experimental observations, in consideration of mixed metal precursor adsorption, thermal decomposition, reduction through electrons from laser-induced thermionic emission, and liquid beads splitting. The production rate reaches up to 30 g/h under the current laser setup. The laser-synthesized graphene shell-encapsulated CrMnFeCoNi NPs loaded on LIG supports are used directly as 3D binder-free integrated electrodes and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 293 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and exceptional stability over 428 hours in alkaline media, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalyst and the counterpart catalysts reported by other methods.

      <title>Investigation of an Ethanol Electroreforming Cell Based on a Pt1Ru1/C Catalyst at the Anode</title>

                The production of H2 from renewable sources represents a crucial challenge for the planet&#8217;s future to achieve net zero emissions and store renewable energy. A possible alternative to water electrolysis (WE), which requires high potential (E &gt; 1.48 V) to trigger the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), would be alcohol electrochemical reforming (ER), which implies the oxidation of short organic molecules such as methanol or ethanol. In ER, energy must be supplied to the system, but from a thermodynamic point of view, the energy request for the methanol or ethanol oxidation reaction is much lower than that of the OER. To study this process, an in-house 50 wt.% Pt1Ru1/C anodic catalyst was easily synthesized according to the Pt sulphite complex route and the impregnation of a carbon support (Ketjenblack, KB) and a Ru precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the structure, composition, and morphology of the catalyst. It appears that two distinct crystallographic phases of the Pt and Ru nanoparticles were encountered after the synthesis conducted by Ru impregnation. For the electrochemical measurements, ethanol electrooxidation (2 M CH3CH2OH) was studied first in a half cell with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) configuration under acid conditions and then in a direct ethanol electroreforming (or electrolysis) cell, equipped with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as the electrolyte. The output current density was 0.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1 V and 90 &#176;C in 2 M ethanol. The remarkable current densities obtained in the alcohol electrolyzer at a low voltage are better than the actual state of the art for PEM ethanol ER.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of Complex Organic Molecules in Turbulent
  Protoplanetary Disks: Effect of stochastic UV irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.17367</link>
      <description>Takeshi Suzuki, Kenji Furuya, Yuri Aikawa, Takashi Shibata, Liton Majumdar, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400064906

                We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 10$^6$ yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO$_2$, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH$_3$OCH$_3$, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH$_3$NH$_2$, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.</description>

                Research findings can offer data and a theoretical framework for a quantitative examination of the bentonite dehydration mechanism. The reasons for changes in pore&#8217; water under the influence of gamma rays in vacuum and in the presence of oxygen was discussed using TGA and DTA, FT-IR spectroscopy. It was revealed that dehydration and pore characteristics are mutually dependent. A question about the associated evolution of dehydration pore&#8216;s water in nanostructured sodium &#8211; bentonite clay under the influence of ionizing rays with and without oxygen has been comparatively studied. The article is devoted to a discussion of how ionizing radiation, passing through nanoclays, produces, or rather begins to produce, chemical effects. It was used Infrared spectroscopy as the method for determining structural responses of natural clay from the Alpoid deposit in the Republic of Azerbaijan, to gamma rays exposure. It was found that under influence of ionizing rays in vacuum obtained hydrogen peroxide. It is of great interest for the study of the dehydration reaction mechanism and its role in formation of H2 under gamma irradiation.</description>

      <title>The differential collapse&#8211;filling evolution process of the paleo-underground river in the Northern Uplift of the Tarim Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2024.1395384</link>

                The characteristics and stages of collapse&#8211;filling in paleo-underground rivers vary in recharge&#8211;runoff&#8211;discharge zones, constraining the associated fracture-caved reservoirs in carbonate strata. This paper comprehensively uses core, fluid inclusion, and carbon&#8211;oxygen isotope to probe the evolution process and migration of collapse&#8211;filling in paleo-underground rivers in the Northern Uplift of the Tarim Basin. The results show that 1) more than three stages of collapse&#8211;filling were identified in recharge&#8211;runoff&#8211;discharge zones, and a four-stage differential collapse&#8211;filling process was proposed to summarize the evolution of paleo-underground rivers. 2) The collapse&#8211;filling process varies spatiotemporally in the recharge, runoff, and discharge zones. Hydrodynamic strength and filling capacity migrate gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. 3) Collapse&#8211;filling mechanisms, including gravity, suffusion, and suction&#8211;erosion mechanisms, also vary along with the collapse&#8211;filling evolution process of paleo-underground rivers. The research provided a new insight to recognize and interpret the differential planar distribution and vertical filling of the paleo-underground river system, which can be further applied to investigate the fracture-caved karst reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Reversible Oxygen Redox Chemistry in High-Entropy P2-Type Manganese-Based Cathodes via Self-Regulating Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c05876</link>

                The irreversible oxygen-redox reactions in the high-voltage region of sodium-layered cathode materials lead to poor capacity retention and structural instability during cycling, presenting a significant challenge in the development of high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries. This work introduces a high-entropy design for layered Na0.67Li0.1Co0.1Cu0.1Ni0.1Ti0.1Mn0.5O2 (Mn-HEO) cathode with a self-regulating mechanism to extend specific capacity and energy density. The oxygen redox reaction was activated during the initial charging process, accompanied by the self-regulation of active elements, enhancing the ionic bonds to form a vacancy wall near the TM vacancies and thus preventing the migration of transition metal elements. Systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations comprehensively support the understanding of the self-regulation mechanism of Mn-HEO. As a result, the Mn-HEO cathode exhibits a stable structure during cycling. It demonstrates almost zero strain within a wide voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.5 V with a remarkable specific capacity (177 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.05 C) and excellent long-term cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 2 C). This work opens a new pathway for enhancing the stability of oxygen-redox chemistry and revealing a mechanism of crystal structure evolution for high-energy-density layered oxides.</description>

      <title>The earliest phases of CNO enrichment in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.14615</link>
      <description>Martina Rossi, D. Romano, A. Mucciarelli, Edoardo Ceccarelli, D. Massari, G. Zamorani, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399991998

                Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

                Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) due to its favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</description>

      <title>Initial-state and final-state effects on hadron production in small collision systems</title>

                Heavy meson production in reactions with nuclei is an active new frontier to understand QCD dynamics and the process of hadronization in nuclear matter. Measurements in various colliding systems at RHIC and LHC, including Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, O-O, p-Pb, and p-O, enable precision tests of the medium-size, temperature, and mass dependencies of the in-medium parton propagation and shower formation. We employ a coupled DGLAP evolution framework that takes advantage of splitting functions recently obtained in softcollinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCETG) and hard thermal loop (HTL) motivated collisional energy loss effects. With jet quenching effects constrained to the nuclear modification factor of charged hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV, we present predictions for light and heavy-meson in Xe-Xe, O-O and p-Pb collisions at the LHC.We find that the nuclear modification scales non-trivially with the quark mass and medium properties. In particular, there can be sizeable collision-induced attenuation of heavy mesons in small systems such as oxygen-oxygen and high-multiplicity p-Pb events. Finally, we analyze the impact of different models of initial-state parton dynamics on the search for QGP signatures in small colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Petrogenesis of the Dalaku&#8217;an Mafic&#8211;Ultramafic Intrusion in the East Kunlun, Xinjiang: Constraints from the Mineralogy of Amphiboles</title>

                The Dalaku&#8217;an mafic&#8211;ultramafic intrusion, located in the western segment of the East Kunlun, presents conducive conditions for the magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide deposits. According to the detailed petrographic observation, the amphiboles within distinct rock types were analyzed by EPMA analysis. The crystallization conditions, such as temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and water content of the magma, were calculated to explore the genesis of the intrusion. The amphiboles were divided into three types: Amp-I, characterized by low silicon content but enrichment of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, predominantly comprising Tschermakitic hornblende and Magnesio-hornblende with mantle-derived traits; Amp-II, exhibiting elevated silicon content but diminished levels of aluminum, titanium, and alkali, primarily constituted of Magnesio-hornblende; whereas Amp-III manifests as Actinolitic hornblende, indicative of crustal origins. The calculated temperatures of amphiboles ranged between Amp-I (955&#8211;880) &#176;C, Amp-II (852&#8211;774) &#176;C, and Amp-III (761&#8211;760) &#176;C; the pressures ranged between Amp-I (454&#8211;274) MPa, Amp-II (194&#8211;93) MPa, and Amp-III (101&#8211;84) MPa; the oxygen fugacities (&#9651;NNO) ranged between Amp-I (0.93&#8211;2.17), Amp-II (1.55&#8211;2.52), and Amp-III (1.89); and the water contents (H2Omelt) ranged from (6.69&#8211;8.67) to (5.90&#8211;7.32). The magma experienced multiple stages of crystallization and underwent complex magma evolution at different depths. The high oxygen fugacity and water content could be attributed to the subduction of the oceanic crust. The magma source of the Dalaku&#8217;an intrusion was metasomatized by fluids from subducting plates, thereby originating within a post-collision extension.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Character Mapping, Bayesian Model Selection, and Biosynthetic Pathways Shed New Light on the Evolution of Habitat Preference in Cyanobacteria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syae025</link>
      <description>Giorgio Bianchini, Martin Hagemann, Patricia S&#225;nchez&#8208;Baracaldo, Systematic biology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400091897

                Abstract Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes to have evolved oxygenic photosynthesis paving the way for complex life. Studying the evolution and ecological niche of cyanobacteria and their ancestors is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of biosphere evolution. These organisms frequently deal with environmental stressors such as salinity and drought, and they employ compatible solutes as a mechanism to cope with these challenges. Compatible solutes are small molecules that help maintain cellular osmotic balance in high salinity environments, such as marine waters. Their production plays a crucial role in salt tolerance, which, in turn, influences habitat preference. Among the five known compatible solutes produced by cyanobacteria (sucrose, trehalose, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine), their synthesis varies between individual strains. In this study, we work in a Bayesian stochastic mapping framework, integrating multiple sources of information about compatible solute biosynthesis in order to predict the ancestral habitat preference of Cyanobacteria. Through extensive model selection analyses and statistical tests for correlation, we identify glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate as the most significantly correlated with habitat preference, while trehalose exhibits the weakest correlation. Additionally, glucosylglycerol, glucosylglycerate, and glycine betaine show high loss/gain rate ratios, indicating their potential role in adaptability, while sucrose and trehalose are less likely to be lost due to their additional cellular functions. Contrary to previous findings, our analyses predict that the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria (living at around 3180 Ma) had a 97% probability of a high salinity habitat preference and was likely able to synthesise glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate. Nevertheless, cyanobacteria likely colonized low-salinity environments shortly after their origin, with an 89% probability of the first cyanobacterium with low-salinity habitat preference arising prior to the Great Oxygenation Event (2460 Ma). Stochastic mapping analyses provide evidence of cyanobacteria inhabiting early marine habitats, aiding in the interpretation of the geological record. Our age estimate of ~2590 Ma for the divergence of two major cyanobacterial clades (Macro- and Microcyanobacteria) suggests that these were likely significant contributors to primary productivity in marine habitats in the lead-up to the Great Oxygenation Event, and thus played a pivotal role in triggering the sudden increase in atmospheric oxygen.</description>

      <title>Assessing the dynamics of O2 desorption from cobalt phthalocyanine by in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy</title>

                We report here the in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) study of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)-catalyzed O2 evolution reaction (OER) and the dynamics of CoPc-O2 dissociation. The self-assembled CoPc monolayer is fabricated on Au(111) substrate and resolved by ECSTM in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The OH&#8722; adsorption on CoPc prior to OER is observed in ECSTM images. During OER, the generated O2 adsorbed on CoPc is observed in the CoPc monolayer. Potential step experiment is employed to monitor the desorption of OER-generated O2 from CoPc, which results in the decreasing surface coverage of CoPc-O2 with time. The rate constant of O2 desorption is evaluated through data fitting. The insights into the dynamics of Co-O2 dissociation at the molecular level via in situ imaging help understand the role of Co-O2 in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and OER.</description>

                Abstract Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution &#8211; with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the Prometheus-HotB code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code ExTraSS (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling &#8211; circumventing the difficulties of representing 56Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models &#8211; we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.</description>

                Abstract The use of solid-oxide materials in electrocatalysis applications, especially in hydrogen-evolution reactions, is promising. However, further improvements are warranted to overcome the fundamental bottlenecks to enhancing the performance of solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which is directly linked to the more-refined fundamental understanding of complex physical and chemical phenomena and mass exchanges that take place at the surfaces and in the bulk of electrocatalysis materials. Here, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate doped with 20 mol% of yttrium, BaZr 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3-&#948; (BZY20) to enable a systematic, large-length-scale, and longer-timescale atomistic simulation of solid-oxide electrocatalysis for hydrogen generation. All parameters for the eReaxFF were optimized to reproduce quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy migrations, electron localization, water adsorption, water splitting, and hydrogen generation on the surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we performed both zero-voltage (excess electrons absent) and non-zero-voltage (excess electrons present) molecular dynamics simulations to observe water adsorption, water splitting, proton migration, oxygen-vacancy migrations, and eventual hydrogen-production reactions. Based on investigations offered in the present study, we conclude that the eReaxFF force field-based approach can enable computationally efficient simulations for electron conductivity, electron leakage, and other non-zero-voltage effects on the solid oxide materials using the explicit-electron concept. Moreover, we demonstrate how the eReaxFF force field-based atomistic-simulation approach can enhance our understanding of processes in SOEC applications and potentially other renewable-energy applications.</description>

                Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial cell growth confined within the milk ducts. Although there has been extensive research on genetic and epigenetic causes of breast carcinogenesis, none of these studies have successfully identified a biomarker for the progression and/or upstaging of DCIS. In this study, we show that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging. First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to define habitats in the tumor intra-ductal microenvironment based on oxygen diffusion distance in our DCIS cohort of 84 patients. Then, we identify cancer cells with metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype, and LAMP2b indicating a hypoxia-induced acid adaptation. Traditionally these markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological perspective, their power to differentiate between indolent and upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology techniques, we discovered distinct spatial patterns of these biomarkers and used the distribution of such patterns to predict patient upstaging. The patterns were characterized by both cellular features and spatial features. With a 5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest classifier to achieve the area under curve(AUC) of 0.74. Our results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital pathology by demonstrating the role of eco-evolution dynamics in predicting cancer progression.</description>

      <title>Effect of MgO addition on the structural evolution, crystallization and properties of self-glazed ceramics sintered from granite sludge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.06.355</link>
      <description>Changyou Liu, Jinshan Lu, Jian Zhou, Ceramics international. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400063362

                Recycling of granite sludge has both economic and environmental benefits. In this paper, high glossiness self-glazed ceramics were prepared from granite sludge with the addition of TiO2, Ca(OH)2 and MgO by combining two-step sintering and low-temperature crystallization. The effect of MgO addition on the phase evolution, crystallization and properties of the glazed ceramics was studied to reveal its role in the diopside precipitation. With increasing MgO content, the reduced glass viscosity accelerates the dissolution of quartz and anorthite into the liquid glass phase, resulting in a decrease in flexural strength above 1% MgO. Meanwhile, the addition of MgO increases the non-bridging oxygen to lower the glass transition temperature. The increase in the Al/Si ratio of the glass phase and the mixed alkaline earth effect contribute to an increase in the crystallization temperature. After thermal treatment at 950 &#176;C, the precipitated diopside increases the crystallinity of the glazed glass-ceramic from 6.4% to 19.3% at 3% MgO, resulting in a surface glossiness of 99.7 GU and a flexural strength of 64.1 MPa. High glossiness self-glazed ceramics with an aesthetic appearance could be used in decorative building tiles for scalable utilization of granite sludge.</description>

      <title>Geochemistry characterization of diagenesis from Mishrif reservoir rocks in the Central Mesopotamian Basin, Iraq: Implication for the differential diagenesis and petroleum significance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2024.106710</link>

                The Cenomanian Mishrif Formation is one of the most important carbonate reservoirs in the Mesopotamian Basin. Detailed petrographic analysis, aided by geochemistry and burial history establishment on Mishrif carbonates from the AD oilfield, located at the margins of the Central Mesopotamian Basin of Iraq, presents a distinctive differential diagenetic mechanism that significantly impacts reservoir quality and exhibits a pronounced relationship with tectonic evolution and hydrocarbon accumulation. Analyses of petrographic features, carbon&#8209;oxygen isotopes, and minor and rare-earth elements reveal that echinoderm shells and rim calcites are results of marine waters; sparry calcites, matrix, and vein calcites from host rock primarily precipitate from meteoric fluid; microspars and vein calcites in the concretionary limestone are derived from brine water. The development of concretionary limestone mainly involves a complex process that comprises extensive bioturbation in marine waters, substantial fabric-selective dissolution in the meteoric zone, and significant sparry calcites occluded dissolved spaces in shallow burial environments. Winding and skew seams of argillaceous sediment around concretionary limestones, as well as the excellent preservation of skeletal remains inside the concretionary zone, manifest that the development of the concretionary limestone accomplished during the early diagenesis stage and pre-compaction. These centimeter-to-decimeter scaled concretionary limestone intermixed with host rock holding abundant open porosities shape the Mishrif reservoir and result in an inconspicuous, dual permeability system. The burial history, integrated with the diagenetic sequence and tectonic evolution, elucidates four stages that clarify interactions of diagenesis, porosity preservation, and hydrocarbon accumulation. The Cenomanian to Turonian period was a critical stage for the development of effective reservoir capacity. The end of the Cretaceous, marked by the contraction of the Neo-Tethys and the complete closure of the South Neo-Tethys, witnessed an early hydrocarbon accumulation event that enhanced reservoir porosity preservation. During the Paleocene to the Early Miocene epoch, the Neo-Tethys tended to be closing. As a result, the Mishrif Formation experienced shallow burial and generated typical concretionary limestone, which provided a rigid framework against compaction. From the Early Miocene to the present, the total closure of the Neo-Tethys and the Zagros Orogeny initiated a significant late oil-filling event that acted as the main accumulation moment, coinciding with efficient trap development and other optimal petroleum conditions. This study contributes to (1) comprehending the genesis of the differential diagenesis and its effect on pore structures and reservoir heterogeneity, and (2) Linking diagenetic sequence to tectonic evolution and hydrocarbon accumulation of foreland basins evolved from Neo-Tethys tectonics.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Functionalized Diamond Nanocone Arrays Coupling Cobalt Phthalocyanine for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

                The development of high-efficiency catalysts plays a crucial role in advancing CO2 electroreduction techniques. Among potential candidate, diamond-based electrocatalysts show promise due to their broad electrochemical windows, which effectively suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and ensure high CO2 reduction efficiency. In this study, we report an integrated electrode composed of oxygen-terminated diamond nanocone (ODcone) with CoPc-molecules anchoring (CoPc/ODcone). The CoPc/ODcone electrodes exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.1% for CO at &#8722;0.97 V vs. RHE, and maintaining an FECO higher than 80% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.67 V to &#8722;1.07 V vs. RHE. The outstanding performance of the CoPc/ODcone electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the nanostructured diamond surface and the CoPc catalyst. The hydroxyl-rich nature of the diamond surface facilitates the anchoring of CoPc molecules and bonding with Co atoms in CoPc. Simultaneously, the nanostructured diamond with sharp tips enhances CO2 adsorption, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of non-metallic carbon materials, particularly diamond, as metal-free catalysts in CO2 electrochemical reduction and tackles challenges such as low current density and poor Faradaic efficiency, thus contributing to the advancement of more effective catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Adaptation of functional traits in Gracilaria dura with the local environment: implications for resource management and exploitation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1397379</link>
      <description>Vasco M. N. C. S. Vieira, Pankaj S. Dawange, Santlal Jaiswar, Jos&#233; P. Sardinha, Vaibhav A. Mantri, Frontiers in marine science. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400056188

                Seaweed functional traits provide insights on natural populations, their adaptations to the local environment, which can be utilized for commercial exploitation. Here, we analyzed the functional traits of Gracilaria dura from two intertidal populations in Veraval and Adri, from the coast of Gujarat, India, over a period of three months. Functional traits were measured by analyzing growth rates, respiration, primary production, antioxidant activity and the content of plant growth hormones. The weight-to-length allometric exponent &#8776;3 indicated that G. dura grew almost isometrically. Furthermore, frond shape was not significantly different. Fronds in Veraval, resting submerged, grew faster than the fronds in Adri, which, lay exposed in the flat bare rock during low tide. Accordingly, the simultaneous increase in antioxidant activity, O 2 production and chlorophyll content in fronds from Adri suggests that stress from desiccation and UV led to the detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species, leading to decreased growth and decreased production of growth hormones. The increased Chl-a may indicate enhanced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) for the dissipation of excess absorbed light. These results aid in establishing the best practices for maximizing biomass yield or the yield of specific molecules. For maximized biomass yield, fronds should not be subject to emersion nor cultivated on the sea-surface. On the other hand, fronds grown subject to emersion or at the sea-surface yield less biomass but more content on molecules such as antioxidants (flavonoids, phenolics, enzymes), that fight stress from desiccation high temperatures and UV. In this case, stress should still be avoided during the initial growth, at the onset of the growth season, in order to not disrupt the production of growth hormones. The increased O 2 production at Adri was initially mistakenly perceived as enhanced Net Primary Production. Only a posterior holistic perspective over the whole data allowed to conclude that it was likely the stress-induced detrimental accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species. More robust experiments are required to establish if the differences observed between locations have led to the evolution of genetic strains specific to each habitat that may show different performances and yields when cultivated in similar environments.</description>

                ABSTRACT Current investigations into the Albian&#8211;Cenomanian sedimentary record within the Western Interior have identified multiple complex tectono&#8208;sedimentary process&#8211;response systems during the ongoing evolution of North America. One key sedimentary succession, the upper Cedar Mountain Formation (Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member), has historically been linked to various regionally and continentally significant tectonic events, including Sevier fold&#8208;and&#8208;thrust deformation. However, the linkage between the Short Canyon Member and active Sevier tectonism has been unclear due to a lack of high&#8208;precision age constraints. To establish temporal context, this study compares maximum depositional ages from detrital zircons recovered from the Short Canyon Member with that of a modified Bayesian age stratigraphic model (top&#8208;down) to infer that the Short Canyon Member was deposited at ca 100 Ma, penecontemporaneous with rejuvenated thrusting across Utah [Pavant (Pahvant), Iron Springs and Nebo thrusts]. These also indicate a short depositional hiatus with the lowermost portion of the overlying Mussentuchit Member. The Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member preserve markedly different sedimentary successions, with the Short Canyon Member interpreted to be composed of para&#8208;autochthonous orogen&#8211;transverse (across the Sevier highlands) clastics deposited within a series of stacked distributive fluvial fans. Meanwhile, the muddy paralic Mussentuchit Member was a mix of orogen&#8211;transverse (Sevier highlands and Cordilleran Arc) and orogen&#8211;parallel basinal sediments and suspension settling fines within the developing collisional foredeep. However, the informally named last chance sandstone (middle sandstone of the Mussentuchit Member) is identified as an orogen&#8211;transverse sandy debris flow originating from the Sevier highlands, similar to the underlying Short Canyon Member. During this phase of landscape evolution, the Short Canyon Member &#8211; Mussentuchit Member depocentre was a sedimentary conduit system that would fertilize the Western Interior Seaway with ash&#8208;rich sediments. These volcaniclastic contributions, along with penecontemporaneous deposits across the western coastal margin of the Western Interior Seaway, eventually would have lowered oxygen content and resulted in a contributing antecedent trigger for the Cenomanian&#8211;Turonian transition Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.</description>

                Abstract Skin lesions, including skin bacterial abscesses, have become one of the most important health challenges and usually need systemic high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Therefore, it is of particular importance to develop novel approaches for treating this ever&#8208;growing challenge to human health. To address this challenge, herein a copper nanostructure is developed giving combined photothermal and chemodynamic therapies for focal infection treatment. The Cu&#8208;based nanostructures with intrinsic catalytic properties are prepared by D&#8208;L or L cysteine (Cys) as ligand and copper ions. It is shown that the multifunctional copper&#8208;Cys (Cu&#8208;Cys) nanostructures can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and they exhibit near infrared (NIR)&#8208;enhanced catalytic activities to improve ROS production for highly efficient eradication of bacteria. Moreover, the results proved O 2 evolution property of the Cu&#8208;Cys nanoparticles (NPs). The nanostructures show shape&#8208;dependent antibacterial activity where DL&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs show higher bactericidal performance than L&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs. In vitro results demonstrate that 2.5 and 1.25 &#181;g mL &#8722;1 of DL&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs is enough to achieve rapid killing of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) respectively under 808 nm light irradiation in 10 min. This work introduces a unique photoactive nanoagent to efficiently treat subcutaneous abscess by combining NIR light&#8208;triggered photothermal effect and catalytic generation of ROS without using any antibiotic.</description>

      <description>Sergio Davinelli, Alessandro Medoro, Rosa Savino, Giovanni Scapagnini, Cellular and molecular neurobiology. 44(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400014053

                Abstract Sleep is a fundamental conserved physiological state across evolution, suggesting vital biological functions that are yet to be fully clarified. However, our understanding of the neural and molecular basis of sleep regulation has increased rapidly in recent years. Among various processes implicated in controlling sleep homeostasis, a bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress has recently emerged. One proposed function of sleep may be the mitigation of oxidative stress in both brain and peripheral tissues, contributing to the clearance of reactive species that accumulate during wakefulness. Conversely, reactive species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), at physiological levels, may act as signaling agents to regulate redox-sensitive transcriptional factors, enzymes, and other effectors involved in the regulation of sleep. As a primary sensor of intracellular oxidation, the transcription factor NRF2 is emerging as an indispensable component to maintain cellular redox homeostasis during sleep. Indeed, a number of studies have revealed an association between NRF2 dysfunction and the most common sleep conditions, including sleep loss, obstructive sleep apnea, and circadian sleep disturbances. This review examines the evidence of the intricate link between oxidative stress and NRF2 function in the context of sleep, and highlights the potential of NRF2 modulators to alleviate sleep disturbances. Graphical Abstract A bidirectional relationship between sleep and oxidative stress has been shown, indicating that sleep may play a protective role against the accumulation of reactive species during wakefulness and sleep deprivation. However, reactive species might also serve as signaling molecules that influence sleep regulation mechanisms. Notably, as a sensor of cellular redox changes, the transcription factor NRF2 is emerging as a key regulator of sleep homeostasis.</description>

      <title>Choice of reaction progress variable under preferential diffusion effects in turbulent syngas combustion based on detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64552-0</link>
      <description>Vinzenz Silvester Wehrmann, Nilanjan Chakraborty, Markus Klein, Josef Ha&#223;lberger, Scientific reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400083587

                The combustion of hydrogen and carbon-monoxide mixtures, so-called syngas, plays an increasingly important role in the safety context of non-fossil energy generation, more specifically in the risk management of incidents in process engineering plants for ammonia synthesis and in nuclear power plants. In order to characterize and simulate syngas/air combustion on industrially relevant scales, subgrid modelling is required, which is often based on a reaction progress variable. To understand the influence of different fuel compositions, turbulence intensities and flame topologies on different possible definitions of reaction progress variable, detailed chemistry direct numerical simulations data of premixed, lean hydrogen/air and syngas/air flames has been considered. A reaction progress variable based on normalized molecular oxygen mass fraction has been found not to capture the augmentation of the normalized burning rate per unit flame surface area in comparison to the corresponding 1D unstretched premixed flame due to preferential diffusion effects. By contrast, reaction progress variables based on other individual species, such as hydrogen, can capture the augmentation of the rate of burning well, but exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to preferential diffusion effects, especially in response to flame curvatures. However, a reaction progress variable based on the linear combination of the main products can accurately represent the temperature evolution of the flame for different mixtures, turbulence intensities and varying local flame topology, while effectively capturing the augmentation of burning rate due to preferential diffusion effects. However, its tendency to assume values larger than 1.0 in the regions of super-adiabatic temperatures poses challenges for future modeling approaches, whereas the reaction progress variable based on hydrogen mass fraction remains bound between 0.0 and 1.0 despite showing deviations in comparison to corresponding variations obtained from the unstretched laminar flame depending on flame curvature variations.</description>

                The Haobugao Zn-Fe-Sn deposit is a typical skarn deposit in the southern Great Xing'an Range of NE China. Despite many advances in understanding its genesis, the detailed ore-forming processes of Zn, Fe and Sn are still unclear. Amphibole, a rock-forming mineral, has been well studied as an indicator of diverse magmatic and metamorphic processes; however, the geochemistry of hydrothermal amphibole has previously received less attention. The Haobugao deposit contains two generations of hydrothermal amphibole (Amp-I and Amp-&#8545;), which provides a good opportunity to use amphibole geochemistry to trace the mineralization process. Early Amp-I coexists with cassiterite, magnetite and quartz, whereas late Amp-II coexists with quartz and sulfides and can be further divided into two subgroups: Amp-&#8545;a (in skarn) and Amp-&#8545;b (in the country rocks of siltstone). The oxygen isotopic compositions of the fluid (&#948;18Ofluid 2.9&#8240;) responsible for the Amp-I formation indicate that the amphiboles formed from mixed magmatic fluid with meteoric water. Amp-I is LREE-depleted and HREE-enriched with obvious negative Eu anomalies. Amp-&#8545; is generally slightly LREE-depleted with negative or positive Eu anomalies and positive Ce anomalies. The incorporation of trace and rare elements is mainly controlled by the fluid composition. Detailed petrological observations and amphibole geochemistry, combined with previous research results, confirm that Sn, Fe, Pb and Zn mineralization occurred during a single mineralization event. From the oxide to the quartz sulfide stage, the ore-forming fluid evolved from high-temperature and oxidized conditions with enrichment of Sn, Li, Be and REEs to low-temperature and reduced or oxidized conditions with enrichment of Cu, Co and Zn. The concentrations of Cu, Co and Zn in different amphiboles vary with the mineral crystallization sequence. This study shows that amphibole geochemistry can be useful for tracing fluid evolution and mineralization processes in hydrothermal systems.</description>

                On the route towards merging neutron stars and stripped-envelope supernovae, binary population synthesis predicts a large number of post-interaction systems with massive stars that have stripped off their outer layers. Yet, observations of such stars in the intermediate-mass regime below the Wolf-Rayet masses are rare. Using X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) data, we discovered three partially stripped star + Be/Oe binaries in the Magellanic Clouds. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra using the PoWR model atmosphere code by superimposing model spectra corresponding to each component. The estimated current masses of the partially stripped stars fall within the intermediate mass range of 4-8 $M_{\odot}$. These objects are overluminous for their stellar masses, matching core He-burning luminosities. Their Be/Oe secondaries have much higher masses than their stripped primaries (mass ratio &gt; 2). All three partially stripped stars show significant nitrogen enrichment and carbon and oxygen depletion on their surfaces. Additionally, one of our sample stars exhibits significant helium enrichment. Our study provides the first comprehensive determination of the wind parameters of partially stripped stars in the intermediate mass range. The wind mass-loss rates of these stars are found to be on the order of $10^{-7} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is over ten times higher than that of OB stars of the same luminosity. Current evolutionary models characterizing this phase typically employ OB or WR mass-loss rates, which underestimate or overestimate stripped stars' mass-loss rates by an order of magnitude. Binary evolution models indicate that the observed primaries had initial masses of 12-17 $M_{\odot}$, making them potential candidates for stripped-envelope supernovae that form neutron stars. If they survive the explosion, these systems may become Be X-ray binaries and later double neutron stars.</description>

                The subject of the research focused on the possibilities of supporting the design of surface water treatment plants using laboratory models. Within the pilot study, the possibilities of using different water treatment processes in the treatment of water from the water reservoir Nov&#233; Ml&#253;ny in the Czech Republic were assessed. The planned treatment plant is to supply a future recreational site from a shallow reservoir with significant eutrophication and chemical industry in the drainage basin. Coagulation, sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, membrane filtration processes and adsorption on granular activated carbon were investigated. These processes were identified by the preliminary study as applicable to water treatment and it was necessary to determine which could be applied given the site conditions. Laboratory models for the individual processes were used during the laboratory testing. During the research, problems encountered were debugged and the models were modified and some extensions were added to the original models. The coagulation and sedimentation processes were investigated using conventional jar tests. The dissolved air flotation process was simulated using a modified jar test and a lab scale model. Different types and doses of coagulants, mixing parameters and residence times were investigated in the tests. Turbidity value was used as an optimization parameter due to its rapidity of determination and low cost. For some tests, potassium permanganate oxidizability (also known as the permanganate index) was also used as an evaluation parameter so that different evaluation parameters could be compared. In addition, for the dissolved air flotation process, the parameters of the produced sludge - its quantity, suspended solids content and chemical oxygen demand - were monitored. These parameters are crucial for discharge of waste water into the sewer and its costs. The adsorption tests on granular activated carbon were performed as batch tests. The evaluation parameter was the manganese index. Another possible variant of activated carbon tests is a continuous flow-through column. These columns also allow monitoring of the process of fouling and the evolution of the effluent over time. The pilot project then used the results of the laboratory tests to create a design for a treatment plant in the area of interest and selected parts of the project documentation. The pilot project demonstrated the usefulness of laboratory testing as a tool to support the design of drinking water treatment plants. At the same time, these tests allow for a faster and more certain identification of the appropriate water treatment technology and thus reduce the extent of semi-operational testing at the site, leading to a more efficient use of funds by investors.</description>

      <title>Study on Novel SCR Catalysts for Denitration of High Concentrated Nitrogen Oxides and Their Reaction Mechanisms</title>

                With the rapid development of industrialization, the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) has become a global environmental issue. Uranium is the primary fuel used in nuclear power generation. However, the production of uranium, typically based on the uranyl nitrate method, usually generates large amounts of nitrogen oxides, particularly NO2, with concentrations in the exhaust gas exceeding 10,000 ppm. High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide are also produced during silver electrolysis processing and the treatment of waste electrolyte solutions. Traditional V-W/TiO2 NH3-SCR catalysts typically exhibit high catalytic activity at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 &#176;C, under conditions of low NOx concentrations and high gas hourly space velocity. However, their performance is not satisfying when reducing high concentrations of NO2. This study aims to optimize the traditional V-W/TiO2 catalysts to enhance their catalytic activity under conditions of high NO2 concentrations (10,000 ppm) and a wide temperature range (200&#8211;400 &#176;C). On the basis of 3 wt% Mo/TiO2, various loadings of V2O5 were selected, and their catalytic activities were tested. Subsequently, the optimal ratios of active component vanadium and additive molybdenum were explored. Simultaneously, doping with WO3 for modification was selected in the V-Mo/TiO2 catalyst, followed by activity testing under the same conditions. The results show that: the NOx conversion rates of all five catalysts increase with temperature at range of 200&#8211;400 &#176;C. Excessive loading of MoO3 decreased the catalytic performance, with 5 wt% being the optimal loading. The addition of WO3 significantly enhanced the low-temperature activity of the catalysts. When the loadings of WO3 and MoO3 were both 3 wt%, the catalyst exhibited the best denitrification performance, achieving a NOx conversion rate of 98.8% at 250 &#176;C. This catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in reducing very high concentration (10,000 ppm) NO2, at a wider temperature range, expanding the temperature range by 50% compared to conventional SCR catalysts. Characterization techniques including BET, XRD, XPS, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD were employed to further study the evolution of the catalyst, and the promotional mechanisms are explored. The results revealed that the proportion of chemisorbed oxygen (O&#945;) increased in the WO3-modified catalyst, exhibiting lower V reduction temperatures, which are favorable for low-temperature denitrification activity. NH3-TPD experiments showed that compared to MoOx species, surface WOx species could provide more acidic sites, resulting in stronger surface acidity of the catalyst.</description>

                Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] &lt; 2 mg/l, during the last two centuries has a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurance of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 yrs in lake Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany) using 17 gravity cores, recovered between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated by the onset of varve preservation in the TSK, and has been dated by varve counting to 1918&#177;1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake-floor depth of 16 m at 1997&#177;1. This indicates oxygen concentration to fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lakefloor (&gt;16 m). Sediment cores at 10&#8211;12 m depth do not contain varves indicating well oxygenation of the upper water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia at the depocenter is a period of five months of [O2] &lt; 5 mgl&#160; &#160;and two months of [O2] &lt; 2 mgl&#160;. Detailed TOC, &#948;13Corg and XRF core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the depletion in DO started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake following a transition phase of several decades during which varve preservation was not accomplished. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and not necessarily requires permanent stratification.</description>
