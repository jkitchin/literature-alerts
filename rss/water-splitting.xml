      <title>Active Site Customizing of Metal&#8211;Organic Materials for Highly Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202407933</link>
      <description>Na Sun, Xiuwen Si, Xiaoqi Wei, Xue Zhou, Yu Han, Fu Ding, Xiangru Kong, Ya&#8208;Guang Sun, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403953999

                Abstract Elucidating the correlation of active sites and catalytic activity in multi&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is key to understanding the mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet it remains nebulous. Herein, a direct pathway combining theoretical prediction with anchoring high&#8208;valence metals is proposed on MOFs to reveal the mechanism of the OER reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts that the co&#8208;modulation by Mo and Co atoms can enhance the conductance of CoMOF and optimize the adsorption&#8208;free energies of the OER intermediates. Guided by the theoretical prediction, the Co&#8208;based MOFs grown on Ni foams are doped with high valence Mo, which is used as model catalysts for the quantitative study of the composition&#8208;dependent OER performance. With Co/Mo in the ratio of 5:1 for the highest OER activity (impressively overpotential of 324 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 96.07 mV dec &#8722;1 ) and excellent stability (maintains for 200 h at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ), the catalysts in this work is superior to commercial benchmarks electrocatalysts (RuO 2 /NF, 420 mV, 199.12 mV dec &#8722;1 ). This work sheds light on the tailoring of the active sites of MOFs, which is highly correlated with the activity of the OER.</description>

      <title>The Interfacial Ni/Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Y Bonds Contribute to High&#8208;Efficiency Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Developing economical and efficient electrocatalysts is critical for hydrogen energy industrialization through water electrolysis. Herein, a novel dual&#8208;site synergistic NiFe/Y 2 O 3 hybrid with abundant interfacial Ni/Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Y bonds is designed by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. In situ Raman spectra combined with DFT calculations reveal that the interfacial Ni/Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Y units greatly promote H 2 O dissociation and optimize the adsorption of both H* and oxygen species, achieving excellent activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction. As expected, NiFe/Y 2 O 3 exhibits a low overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and robust stability of over 200 h at 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 , and also outstanding water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.64 V at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , showing significant potential for real&#8208;world applications.</description>

      <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417987</link>
      <description>Xintong Gao, Pengtang Wang, Xiaojie Sun, Mietek Jaroniec, Yao Zheng, Shi Zhang Qiao, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403963388

                Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO), fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.87 kWh Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50 kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance of NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Carbon Paper Electrocatalysts in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis by Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma Jet Treatment</title>

                NiMoO4 was grown on carbon paper (CP) by a hydrothermal method. A rapid and high-temperature atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) process was used to generate more oxygen-deficient NiMoO4 on the CP surface to serve as an electrode material for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After 60 s of APPJ treatment, the overpotential of the electrode at 100 mA/cm2 decreased to 790 mV and that at 10 mA/cm2 decreased to 368 mV. Additionally, the charge transfer resistance decreased from 2.8 to 1.2 &#937;, indicating that APPJ treatment effectively reduced the electrode overpotential and impedance. The effect of NiMoO4/CP/APPJ-60 s on the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) system was also tested. At a system temperature of 70 &#176;C and current density of 100 mA/cm2, the energy efficiency reached 95.1%, and the specific energy consumption decreased from 4.02 to 3.83 kWh/m3. These results demonstrate that the APPJ-treated NiMoO4/CP electrode can effectively enhance the OER performance in water electrolysis and improve the energy efficiency of the AEMWE system. This approach shows promise in replacing precious metal electrodes, thereby potentially reducing the cost and providing an environmentally friendly alternative.</description>

                In response to energy challenges, rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (RZABs) serve as an ideal platform for energy storage with a high energy density and safety. Nevertheless, addressing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in RZAB requires highly active and robust electrocatalysts. High-entropy Prussian blue analogues (HEPBAs), formed by mixing diverse metals within a single lattice, exhibit enhanced stability due to their increased mixing entropy, which lowers the Gibbs free energy. HEPBAs innately enable sacrificial templating, an effective way to synthesize complex structures. Impressively, in this study, we successfully transform HEPBAs into exquisite multiphase (multimetallic alloy, metal carbide, and metal oxide) heterostructure nanoparticles through a controlled synthesis process. The elusive multiphase heterostructure nanoparticles manifested two active sites for selective ORR and OER. By integrating CNT into HEPBA-derived nanoparticles (HEPBA/CNT-800), the HEPBA/CNT-800 demonstrates superior activity toward both ORR (E1/2 = 0.77 V) in a 0.1 M KOH solution and the OER (&#951; = 330 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2) in a 1 M KOH solution. The RZAB with a HEPBA/CNT-based air electrode demonstrated an open-circuit voltage of 1.39 V and provided a significant energy density of 71 mW cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the charge and discharge cycles lasting up to 40 h at a current density of 5 mA cm&#8211;2 demonstrate its excellent stability. This work provides an alternative avenue for the rational design of HEPBA's derivative for a sustainable rechargeable metal&#8211;air battery platform.</description>

      <title>Local compressive strain-induced anti-corrosion over isolated Ru-decorated Co3O4 for efficient acidic oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53763-8</link>
      <description>Shouwei Zuo, Zhi&#8208;Peng Wu, Deting Xu, Rafia Ahmad, Lirong Zheng, Jing Zhang, Lina Zhao, Wenhuan Huang, Hassan Al Qahtani, Han Yu, Luigi Cavallo, Huabin Zhang, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404020591

                Enhancing corrosion resistance is essential for developing efficient electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report the strategic manipulation of the local compressive strain to reinforce the anti-corrosion properties of the non-precious Co3O4 support. The incorporation of Ru single atoms, larger in atomic size than Co, into the Co3O4 lattice (Ru-Co3O4), triggers localized strain compression and lattice distortion on the Co-O lattice. A comprehensive exploration of the correlation between this specific local compressive strain and electrocatalytic performance is conducted through experimental and theoretical analyses. The presence of the localized strain in Ru-Co3O4 is confirmed by operando X-ray absorption studies and supported by quantum calculations. This local strain, presented in a shortened Co-O bond length, enhances the anti-corrosion properties of Co3O4 by suppressing metal dissolutions. Consequently, Ru-Co3O4 shows satisfactory stability, maintaining OER for over 400 hours at 30 mA cm&#8722;2 with minimal decay. This study demonstrates the potential of the local strain effect in fortifying catalyst stability for acidic OER and beyond. Enhancing corrosion resistance is crucial for efficient electrocatalysts in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, the authors report the strategic manipulation of local compressive strain to improve the anti-corrosion properties of Co3O4, demonstrating stability for over 400 hours at 30 mA cm-2.</description>

                An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal&#8208;air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3&#8208;&#8208;mediated Zn&#8208;air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3&#8208; to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn&#8208;air battery performs an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I&#8208; mainly generates I3&#8208; on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH&#8208; to generate oxygen and further revert to I&#8208;, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system. This work offers a strategy to simultaneously improve the cycling life and reduce the charging voltage of Zn&#8208;air batteries through redox mediator methods.</description>

                An effective strategy to facilitate oxygen redox chemistry in metal-air batteries is to introduce a redox mediator into the liquid electrolyte. The rational utilization of redox mediators to accelerate the charging kinetics while ensuring the long lifetime of alkaline Zn-air batteries is challenging. Here, we apply commercial acetylene black catalysts to achieve an I3--mediated Zn-air battery by using ZnI2 additives that provide I3- to accelerate the cathodic redox chemistry and regulate the uniform deposition of Zn2+ on the anode. The Zn-air battery performs an ultra-long cycle life of over 600 h at 5 mA cm-2 with a final charge voltage of 1.87 V. We demonstrate that I- mainly generates I3- on the surface of carbon catalysts during the electrochemically charging process, which can further chemically react with OH- to generate oxygen and further revert to I-, thus obtaining a stable electrochemical system.

                This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in&#8208;situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96 hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Defect Site Filling Strategy Induced Moderate Enrichment of Reactants for Efficient Electrocatalytic Biomass Upgrading</title>

                Abstract The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a feasible approach for the efficient utilization of biomass. Defect regulation is an effective strategy in the field of biomass upgrading to enhance the adsorption capacity of reactants and thus increase the activity. However, how to select appropriate strategies to regulate the over&#8208;enrichment of reactants induced by excessive oxygen vacancy is still a huge challenge. In this work, the defect&#8208;filling strategy to design and construct an element&#8208;filled oxygen vacancy site layered double hydroxide (S&#9472;Ov&#9472;LDH) is adopted, which achieves a significant reduction in the electrolysis potential of biomass platform molecule HMF oxidation reaction and a significant increase in current density. Physical characterizations, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical calculations prove that the formation of metal&#9472;S bond in the second shell effectively regulates the electronic structure of the material, thus weakening the over&#8208;strong adsorption of HMF and OH &#8722; induced by excessive oxygen vacancy, promoting the formation of high&#8208;valence Co 3+ during the reaction, and forming new adsorption sites. This work discusses the catalytic enhancement mechanism of defect filling in detail, fills the gap of defect filling in the field of biomass upgrading, and provides favorable guidance for the further development of defect regulation strategies.</description>

      <title>ROLE OF SURFACTANTS ON ELECTROCATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF Co/Al LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES FOR HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN GENERATION</title>

                Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have recently attracted much attention in the scientific community as a prominent catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because they are economical, extremely stable and highly active. Here, we synthesized Co/Al based LDH systems that efficiently perform as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. Exfoliation of this layered material via anion intercalation into a few layers further enhanced its activity. In this work, we reported the synthesis of Co/Al LDHs via co&#8208;precipitation followed by hydrothermal method and different surfactant functionalized LDHs (with anionic surfactant &#8211;SDS, cationic surfactant &#8211; CTAB and non&#8208;ionic surfactant &#8211; PEG 4000). SDS modified LDH (s LDH) showed notable stability and competent results in hydrogen evolution in addition to oxygen evolution. The exfoliation of s LDH caused enhancement in the high specific surface area about 6.8 times compared to pristine LDH, as evident from BET data. The onset potential for HER as obtained from the polarisation curve for s LDH is &#8208;0.41 V vs RHE with Tafel slope of 67.4 mV/dec. Similarly, OER onset potential and corresponding Tafel slope are 1.53 V vs RHE at 10 mA/cm2 and 90.2 mV/dec, respectively.</description>

                Abstract Polymetallic oxides with extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands, and way&#8208;out coordination environments, built by an isomorphic substitution strategy, may create unique contributing to concertedly catalyze water oxidation, which is of great significance for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO 2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides. For acidic water oxidation, the obtained InSnRuO 2 displays an ultralow overpotential of 183 mV (versus RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 103.02 A mg Ru &#8722;1 , respectively. For a long&#8208;term stability test of PEMWE, it can run at a low and unchangeable cell potential (1.56 V) for 200 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 , far exceeding current IrO 2 ||Pt/C assembly in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . Accelerated degradation testing results of PEMWE with pure water as the electrolyte show no significant increase in voltage even when the voltage is gradually increased from 1 to 5 A cm &#8722;2 . The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov&#8208;electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self&#8208;trapped Ov&#8208;electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long&#8208;term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next&#8208;generation Ru&#8208;based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>

                The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</description>

                This study explores the effect of Ni-Co-O anode layer microstructure on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Four anodes with similar Ni-Co-O loadings and chemical characteristics but distinct morphologies are fabricated by ultrasonic spraying catalyst inks of varying solvent composition (pure water vs a water-ethanol mixture) and drying temperatures (50 &#176;C and 150 &#176;C) on Ni plates. Upon varying solvent composition, particles in the water-based ink exhibited lower stability than particles in the water-ethanol-based ink, boosting the particle connectivity in the layers. This particle connectivity correlated with the mechanical strength of the layers, resulting in reduced contact resistance and enhanced activity. Our second observation is that at 50 &#176;C, the surface morphology exhibited hill-like islands with higher roughness, while at 150 &#176;C, concave hemispherical shapes with lower roughness were observed. From 2D-distribution data, we found that surface roughness correlated with the wettability with electrolyte. Roughness increased the lyophobicity and enhanced the activity through more accessible active sites and efficient bubble transport. Taken together, this work highlights how microstructure affects macroscopic layer properties, and how these in turn can enhance or diminish the performance of the OER compared to bare nickel, offering insights into the knowledge-based design of anode layers.</description>

                Abstract Efforts are underway to develop highly active catalysts to reduce the high overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Metal&#8211;organic frameworks or coordination polymers are promising candidates because of their tunable structures and high surface areas. In this study, Nickel and Cobalt trans &#8208; cinnamate ( t&#8208;ca ) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Their structures were analyzed and found to be isostructural. Both complexes exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties in the OER compared to those of IrO 2 , with overpotentials of 373 and 390 mV and Tafel slopes of 58 and 66 mV/dec. These excellent characteristics were attributed to the electron delocalization of the metal centers via interactions with &#960;&#8208;&#960; delocalized organic ligands. Ni t&#8208;ca , with stronger ligand interactions, displayed an enhanced OER catalytic performance, emphasizing the importance of metal&#8211;ligand interactions and suggesting that further exploration of diverse &#960;&#8211;&#960; delocalized organic ligands and metal centers may lead to further advancements in electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Hydrogen production by water splitting is one of the low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt-phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the inexpensive and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies to the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with the 11 wt% of P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of &#8211;115.4 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8 wt% (&#8211;121.5 mV) and 5 wt% (&#8211;182.9 mV) of P. In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (394 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with the 8 wt% of P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm-2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5 wt% (416 mV) and 11 wt% (432 mV) of P. These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.</description>

                Abstract Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their low cost, intrinsic safety, and environmental benignity. However, the sluggish kinetics of the cathodic reactions severely limits the ZAB performances in practical use, calling for high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution electrocatalysts. Herein, an ultrahigh&#8208;active bifunctional electrocatalyst is developed with a record&#8208;low &#916; E of 0.56 V, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark (Pt/C+Ir/C, &#916; E = 0.77 V) and many other reported bifunctional electrocatalysts (mostly &#916; E &#8805; 0.60 V). The nanoscale composite of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom sites and nanosized layered double hydroxides endows the bifunctional electrocatalyst with high conductivity and a large active surface that afford strengthened electron conduction and ion transport pathways. Furthermore, a remarkable improvement in stability is realized following the current division principle. ZABs with the bifunctional electrocatalyst deliver a high peak power density of 198 mW cm &#8722;2 and excellent cycling durability for over 6000 cycles. Moreover, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale ZABs are constructed and cycled under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions. This work breaks the activity record for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and expands the potential of ZABs for sustainable energy storage.</description>

                The development and exploration of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting are in high demand and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Herein, by incorporating the advantages of catalytic&#8208;active polyoxometalates (POMs) and structural stable metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), two POM@MOFs composite materials, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe, have been successfully prepared via the encapsulation of POMs anions [MoV12O30(&#181;2&#8208;OH)10H2{NiII4(H2O)12}]&#8729;14H2O (noted as Ni4Mo12) and [MoV12O30(&#956;2&#8208;OH)10 H2{CoII(H2O)3}4]&#8729;12H2O (noted as Co4Mo12) into the cavities of MOFs NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe), respectively. Compared to each individual components, Ni4Mo12@Fe and Co4Mo12@Fe composites, as heterogeneous electrocatalysts, both showed enhanced electrocatalytic capacities for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions with overpotentials of 332.64 mV for Ni4Mo12@Fe and 352.64 mV for Co4Mo12@Fe at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Additionally, the enhanced electrocatalytic capacities of these two composites could also achieve towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such a POMs&#8208;assisted strategy for the formation of POM@MOFs composites described here paves a new avenue for the development of highly economical, active non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Cathode Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;air Batteries based on the Derivatives of MXene@ZIFs</title>

                Abstract Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial processes at the cathode of zinc&#8208;air batteries. Developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts at the air cathode is significant for the practical application of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. Herein, N&#8208;doped layered MX containing Co 2 P/Ni 2 P nanoparticles is synthesized by growing CoNi&#8208;ZIF on the surface and interlayers of the two&#8208;dimensional material MXene (Ti 2 C 3 ) followed by phosphating calcination. The growth of CoNi&#8208;ZIF on the surface of MXene results in the attenuation of high&#8208;temperature structural damage of MXene, which in turn leads to the formation of Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX with a hierarchical configuration, higher electron conductivity, and abundant active sites. The optimized Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 V for the ORR and an overpotential of 345 mV for the OER. In addition, DFT calculations were adopted to investigate the mechanism at the atomic and molecular levels. The liquid zinc&#8208;air battery with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 783.7 mAh g &#8208;1 and exceeds 280 h (840 cycles) cycle stability, superior to zinc&#8208;air batteries constructed by the cathode of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 and other previous works. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;state battery synthesized with Co 2 P/Ni 2 P@MX as the cathode exhibits stable cycle performance (154 h/462 cycles).</description>

                Abstract Design of highly efficient cost effective and self-supported bi-functional electrocatalyst for the production of green Hydrogen is significant for renewable and sustainable energy conversion to achieve future carbon neutral. Meanwhile, as we know that the overall water splitting is an uphill reaction requires 285.8 kJ of energy, corresponds to the HHV of hydrogen, state-of-the-art developments are necessary to greatly improve the efficiency by rationally designing non-precious metal-based robust bi-functional catalysts for promoting both the cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic oxygen evolution reactions. The performance of metal phosphide towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution was examined under application relevant conditions in an alkaline and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer cell stack. The in-house designed stacked electrolyzer exhibited stable performances with a hydrogen production rate of few Nm3 per hour without any decay, pave the path towards large scale application with substantial reduction in CAPEX and OPEX cost.

      <title>Evaluating nonmetal atom doping in two-dimensional VSe2 monolayers for hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0232667</link>

                The electrocatalytic performance of VSe2 doped with nonmetals (NMs) was studied using density functional theory, in which NM atoms (C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I) replaced Se or V (denoted as NM@Se or NM@V). Notably, P@V and Br@V monolayers exhibit high catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity with the lowest &#916;GH* = 0.08 eV and &#8722;0.03 eV, respectively, surpassing Pt (&#916;GH* = &#8722;0.1 eV). By applying the scaling relationship of &#916;GH* of H*, which is an intermediate for each volcano, the exchange current density diagrams are established. Based on thermodynamic analysis, P@V and Br@V monolayers produce exchange currents of about &#8722;1.42 and &#8722;0.70i0/(A cm&#8722;2), respectively. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of the I@Se monolayer (&#951;OER = 0.95 V) is the best among all the monolayers. Among the oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, the O@Se monolayer displays high activity with a low &#951;ORR (0.82 V), which is even better than that of binary Pt and Pd alloys (0.9&#8211;0.87 V).</description>

      <title>Seawater Electrolysis at Ultra-High Current Density: A Comparative Analysis of Cylindrical versus Conical Electrodes</title>

                Seawater electrolysis preferentially leans towards Chlorine Evolution Reaction (CER) over Oxygen Evolution Reactions (OER) under conventional conditions, but OER becomes more dominant at sufficiently higher current densities. In this study, we evaluated the effector of cylindrical and conical electrode geometries on CER and hydrogen production at high current density (i.e., &amp;gt;1 A/cm2). We found the point of lowest CER within a voltage range of 40 V to 90 V. Conical electrodes, optimized to reduce CER, produced a magnitude less chloride (502 ppb) than cylindrical electrodes (1485 ppb) at nearly double the current density (~12 and ~6 A/cm2 respectively). However, this reduction in CER with conical electrodes was accompanied by a 25% decrease in hydrogen production. In addition, both cylindrical and conical electrodes were able to heat 500 ml of seawater by approximately 6-7 degrees Celsius over a two-minute period with cylindrical electrodes heating slightly less than conical electrodes.</description>

      <title>Photocarrier Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Aza-Fused Covalent Organic Frameworks as Bifunctional Photocatalysts toward Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Designing high-efficiency bifunctional photocatalysts toward photoinduced overall water splitting is one of the most promising and challenging research directions for clean energy generation. By employing static electronic structure calculation and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulation, we herein established a recently synthesized two-dimensional (2D) aza-fused covalent organic framework (aza-COF) as a potential bifunctional photocatalyst toward overall water splitting reactions. Our calculated results reveal that the overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction are only 0.06 and 0.31 V, respectively, at pH = 4. The dynamics of photoexcited charge carriers studied through NAMD simulation predicts the electron&#8211;hole recombination time (25.15 ns), and this confirms that the photogenerated electron and hole carriers migrate to the active sites for the occurrence of reaction before they recombine. Therefore, our results suggest that the 2D aza-COFs exhibit great potential as metal-free and single-material photocatalysts toward overall water splitting under visible light.</description>

      <title>Quantification of electrochemically accessible iridium oxide surface area with mercury underpotential deposition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adp8911</link>

                Research drives development of sustainable electrocatalytic technologies, but efforts are hindered by inconsistent reporting of advances in catalytic performance. Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202416141</link>

                The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8211;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000 h of operation in 1.0 M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8211;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.</description>

                An energy transition to renewable energy sources is necessary due to the scarcity of fossil fuels and their detrimental effects on the environment. Water splitting process is one of the practical and effective way that does not occur spontaneously. This study investigates catalytic activity of Cu-Zn-Sn (CZT) photocatalyst in hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction. The CZT deposited with varied electrolyte&#8217;s pH of 6 and 9 on indium tin oxide substrate at the room temperature for 600 seconds. According to the X-ray diffraction patterns, there were Cu6Sn5, Cu5Zn8, and Sn metal phases with monoclinic, cubic, and cubic crystal systems. The scanning electron microscopy technique results of all CZT alloy sample showed a dense, non-uniform, and polycrystalline surface structure. The CZT alloys were found to have an average particle size of 0.35 &#956;m. CZT alloys can produce a photocurrent density of 0.19 mA/cm&#178; at a potential of 1.29 V vs RHE. the charge transfer resistance of CZT synthesized at pH 6 is lower (21.48 &#937;) compared to pH 9 (28.36 &#937;). The Tafel slope of HER for pH 9 CZT was -133 mV/dec, which was lower than that of pH 6 CZT (-88 mV/dec), indicating faster H2 production and corrosion resistance on pH 9 CZT.</description>

                Abstract Borophene, an anisotropic metallic Dirac material exhibits superlative physical and chemical properties. While the lack of bandgap restricts its electronic chip applications, insufficient charge carrier density and electrochemical/catalytically active sites, restricts its energy storage and catalysis applications. Fluorination of borophene can induce bandgap and yield local electron injection within its crystallographic lattice. Herein, a facile synthesis of fluoroborophene with tunable fluorine content through potassium fluoride&#8208;assisted solvothermal&#8208;sonochemical combinatorial approach is reported. Fluoroborophene monolayers with lateral dimension 50 nm&#8211;5 &#181;m are synthesized having controlled fluorine content (12&#8211;35%). Fluoroborophene exhibits inter&#8208;twinned crystallographic structure, with fluorination&#8208;tunable visible&#8208;range bandgap &#8776;1.5&#8211;2.5 eV, and density functional theory calculations also corroborate it. Fluoroborophene is explored for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium and bestow a good stability. Tunable bandgap, electrophilicity and molecular anchoring capability of fluoroborophene will open opportunities for novel electronic/optoelectronic/spintronic chips, energy storage devices, and in numerous catalytic applications.</description>

                Abstract Compared to the traditional oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) generally exhibits a lower overpotential during the electrolytic process, which is conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. The superior structure and abundant sites play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of urea molecules. Therefore, this paper introduces a simple metal cation&#8208;induced gelation method to prepare an electrocatalyst with PtNi alloy&#8208;NiO dual sites supported on Ti 3 C 2 T x , which simultaneously exhibits excellent UOR and HER performance. PtNi&#8208;NiO x /Ti 3 C 2 T x demonstrates good catalytic activity for the urea oxidation reaction, requiring only 1.364 V (overpotential of 0.994 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in UOR, and also exhibits remarkable catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, with PtNi&#8208;NiO x /Ti 3 C 2 T x achieving a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in HER with only 24 mV of overpotential. In the UOR//HER two&#8208;electrode electrolysis cell, it requires only 1.361 and 1.538 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the dual active sites can intelligently adsorb the electron&#8208;donating/electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activate chemical bonds, and thereby initiate urea decomposition.</description>

                Preparing cost-effective and highly active catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction is crucial for developing hydrogen-based technologies. Hence, four conductive polyanilines, prepared by the environmentally-friendly approach using Fe3O4 nanoparticles/H2O2 as the catalyst/main oxidant system (PANI/Fe3O4), were investi&#172;gated for the first time as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media (0.1 M H2SO4) by using voltammetry and chronoamperometry. PANI/Fe3O4 electrodes exhibited Tafel slope values in the -171 to -246 mV dec-1 range depending on the synthesis conditions &#8210; Fe3O4/aniline mass ratio and polymerization time. The sample PANI/Fe3O4-II(3) prepared with shorter reaction time and higher Fe3O4/aniline mass ratio showed the best electrocatalytic behaviour reflected in the lowest onset potential (-0.286 V), the lowest overpotential to reach a current density of -10 mA cm-2, the highest current density, the lowest HER activation energy (10 kJ mol-1), and the lowest charge-transfer resistance (5.3 &#937;) under HER conditions. Materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photo&#172;electron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and differences in their electrocatalytic HER performance were explained by differences in their content of Fe3O4, surface and electrical properties. Moreover, the possibility of using PANI/Fe3O4-II(3) as HER electrocatalyst in a wider range of pH (i.e. in alkaline media as well) and as a bifunc&#172;tional electrocatalyst, i.e., for oxygen evolution reaction beside HER, was also examined.</description>

                The construction of supported Ir-based catalysts can effectively reduce the amount of Ir and generate a synergistic effect that enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability, making it one of the effective solutions for optimizing acidic OER catalysts. However, most reported metal oxide supports suffer from poor acid resistance and low electrical conductivity, which are critical for the OER process. Herein, we synthesized a nanosheet-like defected 1T phase-rich MoBxS2&#8211;x via a molten salt calcination process, during which the 1T phase was formed, and B was intercalated into MoS2 to protect the 1T phase structure during annealing procedure. After the wet refluxing process, IrOx clusters were uniformly deposited on the surface of MoBxS2&#8211;x to form IrOx@MoBxS2&#8211;x, which exhibited an overpotential of 168 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with an Ir loading amount of 25.8 wt %. By comparing the OER performance of IrOx@MoBxS2&#8211;x, IrOx@MoS2(Calcinated), and IrOx@MoS2, it is demonstrated that calcination and B intercalation of MoS2 can significantly increase acidic OER performance. This work digs into the application of 1T-MoS2 as an OER catalyst support, providing strategies for the phase and morphology control of 1T-MoS2.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting required efficient electrocatalysts to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Here, we adopted greenway coprecipitation (GC) method to synthesize conducting polymer (CP) nanotunnel network affixed with luminal&#8211;abluminal CoNi hydroxides (GC-CoNiCP), namely, GC-Co1Ni2CP, GC-Co1.5Ni1.5CP, and GC-Co2Ni1CP. The active catalyst, GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC, has low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (307 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (47 mV dec&#8211;1) than IrO2 (125 mV dec&#8211;1). The electrochemical active surface area (EASA) normalized linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve exhibited outstanding intrinsic activity of GC-Co2Ni1CP, which required 285 mV to attain 10 mA cm&#8211;2. At 1.54 V, the estimated turnover frequency (TOF) of GC-Co2Ni1CP/GC (0.017337 s&#8211;1) was found to be 3-fold higher than that of IrO2 (0.0014 s&#8211;1). Furthermore, the GC-Co2Ni1CP/NF consumed a very low overpotential (281 mV) with a small Tafel slope of 121 mV dec&#8211;1. The ultrastability of GC-Co2Ni1CP for industrial application was confirmed by durability at 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2 for the OER (GC/NF-8 h, 2.0%/100 h, 2.2%) and overall water splitting (100 h, 3.8%), which implies that GC-Co2Ni1CP had adequate kinetics to address the elevated rates of water oxidation. The effect of pH and addition of tetramethylammonium cation (TMA+) reveal that GC-Co2Ni1CP follows the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). The solar-powered water electrolysis at 1.55 V supports the efficacy of GC-Co2Ni1CP in the solar-to-hydrogen conversion. The environmental impact studies and solar-driven water electrolysis proved that GC-CoNiCP has excellent greenness and efficiency, respectively.</description>

      <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>

                Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO), fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.87 kWh Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17 kWh Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81 kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50 kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Reaction through the Improved Mass Transfer and Charge Transfer by Bimetal Nodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c11560</link>
      <description>Zhihui Li, Xinyu Zhang, Yiran Teng, Hanming Zhang, Tongguang Xu, Fei Teng, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403955258

                The high cost of hydrogen production by water electrolysis severely challenges its commercial application. It is highly desirable to develop efficient electrocatalysts and innovative electrolytic cells. Introducing additional metal nodes to form bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is a simple, feasible strategy to overcome the poor electrocatalytic performance of single-metal MOF. In this study, the hydrothermal method is used to synthesize bimetallic NixCoy-BTC. It is found that for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ni0.8Co0.2-BTC merely requires a potential of &#8722;0.203 V (vs reverse hydrogen electrode, RHE) to achieve 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which is significantly lower than that of Ni-BTC (&#8722;0.341 V vs RHE). Notably, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis indicate that NixCoy-BTC has improved charge transfer and mass transfer process, compared with Ni-BTC. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) confirms that Ni0.8Co0.2-BTC has more unpaired electrons than Ni-BTC. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that compared with Ni-BTC, NixCoy-BTC is more thermodynamically favorable for the adsorption of H+, OH&#8211;, and H2O. It demonstrates that the change of mass transfer caused by bimetallic nodes and the delicate variation of MOF surface play an important role in the electrochemical process. Moreover, a novel electrolytic cell was developed using a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) to replace oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this MOR-based electrolytic cell, a current density of 50 mA cm&#8211;2 can be achieved at only a cell voltage of 1.85 V, which is lower than the 2.22 V of OER-based electrolytic cell, suggesting that 16.7% electric energy can be saved. At the same time, the Faraday efficiency (FE, 98.2%) of the MOR-based cell is higher than that (94.5%) of the OER-based cell. This research offers a promising strategy for low-cost hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency in Alkaline Water Electrolysis Using Optimized Raney Nickel Coatings on Stainless Steel Electrodes</title>

                Abstract Hydrogen, as a clean and high-energy-density fuel, holds immense promise for future energy systems. The aim of this study is to enhance the efficacy and durability of hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) in alkaline water electrolysis by optimizing Raney Nickel coatings on stainless steel electrodes. This work aims to reduce costs and improve the performance of electrolysis systems, making hydrogen production more feasible for large-scale applications. The study involved the electrodeposition of Raney Nickel on stainless steel substrates using a modified Watt&#8217;s bath. The pretreatment process included degreasing, acid pickling, and Nickel Strike coating to prepare the electrode surface. Functional coatings were applied in a solution containing NiSO4, NiCl2, H3BO3, and ZnCl2 at 50&#176;C. The obtained coating substrates were characterized both chemically and morphogically by XRF analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The performance of the electrodes was evaluated through electrochemical measurements, determining the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and overpotentials for HER and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) The optimized Raney Nickel coatings, referred to as Raney 2, demonstrated a significant improvement in both HER and OER performance compared to traditional coatings. The Raney 2 coating exhibited a threefold increase in ECSA. The accelerated aging tests showed that the Raney 2 coating outperformed Raney 1, with lower peak voltages and improved stability over time. The roughness factor of the Raney 2 electrode is higher, indicating has an extensive reactive surface area. Furthermore, the study confirmed that the incorporation of elements from the 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode, such as iron, contributed to enhanced catalytic activity, particularly for OER. These findings suggest that the modified coating process can significantly extend the operational life and efficiency of electrolysis electrodes. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing the performance of Raney Nickel coatings by incorporating a 316-grade stainless steel counter-electrode during deposition, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. The resulting hybrid coating demonstrates superior electrochemical performance and durability, offering a cost-effective solution for improving alkaline water electrolysis systems. This advancement can significantly contribute to the development of more sustainable and efficient hydrogen production technologies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Annealing Temperature on the OER Activity of NiO(111) Nanosheets Prepared via Microwave and Solvothermal Synthesis Approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c14277</link>

                Earth-abundant transition metal oxides are promising alternatives to precious metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and are intensively investigated for alkaline water electrolysis. OER electrocatalysis, like most other catalytic reactions, is surface-initiated, and the catalyst performance is fundamentally determined by the surface properties. Most transition metal oxide catalysts show OER activities that depend on the predominantly exposed crystal facets/surface structure. Therefore, the design of synthetic strategies to obtain the most active crystal facets is of significant research interest. In this work, rock salt NiO OER catalysts with (111) predominantly exposed facets were synthesized by a solvothermal (ST) method either heated under supercritical or microwave-assisted (MW) conditions. Particular emphasis was placed on the influence of the post annealing temperature on the structural configuration and OER activity to compare their catalytic performances. The as-prepared electrocatalysts are pure &#945;-Ni hydroxides which were converted to rock salt NiO (111) nanosheets with hexagonal pores after heat treatment at different temperatures. The OER activity of the electrodes has been evaluated in 0.1 M KOH using geometric and intrinsic current densities via normalization by the disk area and BET area, respectively. The lowest overpotential at a geometric current density of 10 mA/cm2 is found for samples pretreated by heating between 400 and 500 &#176;C with a catalyst loading of 115 &#956;g/cm2. Despite the very similar nature of the catalysts obtained from the two methods, the ST electrodes show a higher geometric and intrinsic current density for 500 &#176;C pretreatment. The MW electrodes, however, achieve an optimal geometric current density for 400 &#176;C pretreatment, while their intrinsic current density requires pretreatment over 600 &#176;C. Interestingly, pretreated electrodes show consistently higher OER activity as compared to the poorly crystalline/less ordered hydroxide as-prepared electrocatalysts. Thus, our study highlights the importance of the synthesis method and pretreatment at an optimal temperature.</description>

      <title>Influence of platinum content on semiconductor and electrochemical properties of materials based on titanium suboxides</title>

                The effect of platinum content on the surface morphology, phase composition and electrochemical properties of materials based on titanium suboxides was investigated. Titanium suboxides are formed at the stage of coating reduction under cathodic polarization, which allows the formation of a porous developed surface for electrodeposition of catalytic platinum layers. The main allotropic modification of TiOx in the studied composite materials is anatase, which contains particles of elemental titanium and platinum. The investigated materials are highly doped semiconductors with a high concentration of charge carriers. With an increase in the platinum content, an extreme dependence of the potential of flat zones is observed, which is associated with the formation of a composite material. The electrocatalytic activity was studied in the reactions of oxygen and hydrogen evolution. The overvoltage of oxygen production on platinum-containing materials is much lower than on the TiOx electrode. The slope of the linear dependence of the potential on the current density decreases with an increase in platinum content. The Tafel slope for the studied materials in the hydrogen evolution reaction was 160 mV&#61655;dec&#8211;1 for coatings containing 0.25 mg&#61655;cm&#8211;2 Pt; whereas it was equal to 42 and 43 mV&#61655;dec&#8211;1 for electrodes with 0.5 and 2 mg&#61655;cm&#8211;2 Pt, respectively.</description>

                This study explores carbon dioxide enrichment in anaerobic digestion to boost biomethane production and assess degradation kinetics and methanogenic pathway evolution. Carbon dioxide enrichment was found to improve inoculum digestion, supplying additional energy for methanogenic archaea. The methane yield of blank inocula increased by 53 % to 77 % after carbon dioxide enrichment. Although further digestion of inoculum residues took longer, rapid adaptation led to an increased methane production rate that surpassed the lag phase. No antagonistic effects were observed with carbon dioxide enrichment after applying the feedstocks. Increased methane production, along with a significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand, confirms the impact of carbon dioxide enrichment on inoculum digestion. Isotope analysis showed an increase in &#948;</description>

                The versatility, contribution to sustainability, and diversity of applications of bacterial cellulose require large-scale production processes and new alternatives in terms of biological systems that, under controlled conditions, favor the growth and production of this biomaterial. This review article describes the technologies developed and the advances achieved in regard to the production of bacterial cellulose on a small and large scale, according to the findings evidenced in the scientific literature in the last ten years. A review, based on the guidelines in the PRISMA&#174; methodology, of a selection of articles was carried out, with a Cohen&#8217;s Kappa coefficient of 0.465; scientific databases, such as Web of Science, SCOPUS, PubMed, Taylor and Francis, and ProQuest, were considered. There is a wide variety of bacterial pulp production systems and the design of such a system is based on the type of cellulose-producing bacteria, oxygen requirements, mixing and agitation, temperature control, sterilization and cleaning requirements, and production scalability. The evolution in the development of bioreactors for bacterial cellulose has focused on improving the production process&#8217;s efficiency, productivity, and control, and adapting to the specific needs of bacterial strains and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Murburn redox bioenergetics and ROS-radiations connectivity: Insights into the origin, evolution, sustenance and termination of life!</title>

                Research leading to murburn (&#8216;mured burning&#8217;) concept disclosed the previously ignored, yet unavoidable central physiological function of diffusible reactive (oxygen/sulfur/nitrogen) species (abbreviated as DRS or DROS/DRSS/DRNS) at low concentrations, namely that of coupling factors in numerous redox-processes, like oxidative-/photo-phosphorylation, leading to direct in fluid ATP synthesis by exergonic radical reactions. The formation of oxygen-centric anions/radicals near proteins/membrane surfaces leads to effective charge separation (ECS), serving as the origin of &#8216;cellular electrical activity&#8217;. The stochastic interactive chemical equilibriums of DRS with components in the fluid (ADP, Pi, and others) are characterized by an observable new type of stochastic, hormetic and idiosyncratic &#8216;outside active center&#8217; mechanism/kinetics. In conjunction with coacervate organization, murburn could maintain discrete ion and solute differentials across &#8216;islets&#8217; of different phases without ion-pumping or deterministic electron transport chains. Murburn-type reactions within pre-biotic coacervates afforded powering, coherence, homeostasis, electro-mechanical features and sensing/responding abilities (PCHEMS: the &#8216;instant&#8217; functions of life), later supplemented and propagated by deterministic genetic means (central dogma) in cellular systems. As murburn (with ECS-DRS as core physiology) and coacervation rooted cellular PCHEMS since life&#8217;s origin (evidenced currently by the incorporation of convoluted lipid-membrane enriched structures of mitochondria and chloroplasts as the bioenergetic micro-organelles) and sustained it thereafter, normal aging, disease, evolution and termination must be understood in the new framework. Further, this write-up provides a viable thermodynamic rationale for DRS-radiation connectivity in routine/pathological cellular functions.</description>

                We report a solution-based approach for the synthesis of oxidation-free MoS2 films, focusing on interface analysis. Through a sulfurization-free solution process and single-step annealing, the oxidation-free MoS2 film is successfully prepared on Si3N4 surfaces, showing improved uniformity with a surface roughness below 0.5 nm and a thickness of 4 nm at a precursor solution concentration of 30 mM, annealed between 700 and 800&#186;C. The MoS2 films exhibit a hexagonal lattice structure with crystallographic orientations of (1 1 0 0) and (1 2 1 0) with lattice spacings of 0.27 nm and 0.16 nm respectively. Interfacial analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on SiO2 reveals migration of oxygen species as evidenced by a shift in the Si 2p spectrum at binding energies between 102.6 eV and 102.8 eV. MoS2 films on Si3N4 show a complex Si 2p peak evolution at binding energies between 100.9 and 101.8 eV, providing valuable insights into the synthesis of oxide-free MoS2 films for potential applications in advanced electronic devices.</description>

                Abstract Ferroelectricity in hafnium&#8208;based materials has attracted significant research attention and is used in various applications owing to their complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor compatibility, scalability, and low&#8208;power operation. However, their widespread integration into various technologies is hindered by reliability and stability problems, particularly field&#8208;induced instability, which causes fluctuations in polarization characteristics during operation. Herein, on the underlying mechanism of field&#8208;induced instability is reported in pure hafnium oxide films within metal&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MFIS) ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs). The comprehensive material analysis combined with low&#8208;frequency noise (LFN) measurements reveals that the presence of oxygen vacancies and interface traps within the ferroelectric and dielectric layers induces a charge imbalance in the FTJ, leading to distortion in its polarization characteristics and the onset of cyclic evolution in field&#8208;induced instability. Furthermore, high&#8208;pressure annealing effectively mitigates field&#8208;induced instability by reducing the defects within the film, thereby alleviating the associated charge imbalance. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of FTJs and provide an efficient approach to enhancing their stability.</description>

                Recently, methane has been considered a next-generation carbon feedstock due to its abundance and it is main component of shale gas and biogas. Methylomonas sp. DH-1 has been evaluated as a promising industrial bio-catalyst candidate. Succinate is considered one of the top building block chemicals in the agricultural, food, and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, succinate production by Methylomonas sp. DH-1 was improved by combining adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technology with genetic engineering in the chromosome of Methylomonas sp. DH-1, such as deletion of bypass pathway genes (succinate dehydrogenase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) or overexpression of genes related with succinate production (citrate synthase, pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Through ALE, the maximum consumption rate of substrate gases (methane and oxygen) and the duration maintaining high substrate gas consumption rates was enhanced compared to those of the parental strain. Based on the improved methane consumption, cell growth (OD600) increased more than twice, and the succinate titer increased by ~ 48% from 218 to 323 mg/L. To prevent unwanted succinate consumption, the succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene was deleted from the genome. The first enzyme of TCA cycle (citrate synthase) was overexpressed. Pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, which produce oxaloacetate, a substrate for citrate synthase, were also overproduced by a newly identified strong promoter. The new strong promoter was screened from RNA sequencing data. When these modifications were combined in one strain, the maximum titer (702 mg/L) was successfully improved by more than three times. This study demonstrates that successful enhancement of succinic acid production can be achieved in methanotrophs through additional genetic engineering following adaptive laboratory evolution.</description>

                Sterol biosynthesis has evolved early in the history of eukaryotes. In most animals, as well as in primitive fungi, the main sterol is cholesterol. During the process of evolution, fungi acquired the ability to synthesize ergosterol. The pathway of its biosynthesis is more complex than the one of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, the evolutionary choice of most fungi was ergosterol, and the reason for this choice is still debated. In the majority of the works on this issue, the choice of most fungi is associated with the transition to life on land, and, consequently, the danger of cell dehydration. In our review we oppose this point of view. Probably, compared to cholesterol, ergosterol has more pronounced antioxidant properties. Indeed, the presence of three double bonds in the structure of the ergost&#1077;rol molecule, as compared to one in cholesterol, relatively increases the likelihood of interaction with reactive oxygen species. Perhaps, the transition to life on land required additional antioxidant protection. Due to the aforementioned structural differences, the molecule of cholesterol is apparently more flexible than that of ergosterol. Experimental data indicate that this feature provides greater membrane flexibility as compared to fungal membranes, as well as a greater ability to compensate for disturbances in the packing of membrane phospholipids. Presumably, for animal cells these qualities turned out to be relatively more important than antioxidant ones, which predetermined their evolutionary choice of sterol.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Defect-Dependent Conductivity-Type Switching in CuFe2O4 for Enhanced Photoelectrocatalytic Reduction of Benzaldehyde</title>

                Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds provides a sustainable approach to upgrading biomass-derived feedstocks with reduced energy requirements. However, PEC reduction has primarily focused on hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction reactions, limited by the availability of stable photocathode materials. In this study, we demonstrate the extended PEC performance of defect-engineered CuFe2O4 films, achieving over 18 hours of stable benzaldehyde reduction to benzyl alcohol. Modulating CuFe2O4 conductivity from n-type to p-type through controlled annealing conditions enhanced its hole concentration, achieving a cathodic photocurrent density of 1.5 mA/cm2 at 0.5 V vs. RHE. Using 1,4-benzoquinone as a redox mediator in a mixed acetonitrile/water electrolyte, the PEC system produced benzyl alcohol at a rate of 2.57 &#956;mol/h with a Faradaic efficiency of 51.3% at 0.50 V vs. Ag/AgNO&#8323;. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) revealed that oxygen-rich annealing conditions improved charge transport and surface catalytic activity, resulting in a threefold increase in benzyl alcohol production rate. This PEC approach lowered the required applied potential by ~1 V compared to traditional electrocatalysis methods, offering a more energy-efficient route for carbonyl reduction. These findings underscore the potential of CuFe&#8322;O&#8324; as a viable photocathode material for sustainable organic transformations under mild reaction conditions.</description>

      <title>The molecular composition of birch tar and its infrared spectrum</title>

                Abstract Birch tar was the first substance made by humans that is otherwise not available in nature. The oldest artefacts date to ~ 200 thousand years ago in Europe but birch tar becomes more frequent around 45 thousand years ago and even more so from the Mesolithic onwards. Their study has important implication for our understanding of evolutionary processes such as cognitive capacity and cultural evolution. What remains unknown is the overall molecular composition of birch tar. Several approaches based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry have shown the potential of studying solvent soluble molecules to understand the botanical origin of different tars, their manufacturing techniques and their post-depositional alteration mechanisms. However, birch tar&#8217;s soluble fraction cannot shed light on its mechanical properties. In this study, we conduct gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and spectroscopic analysis of seven bulk birch tar samples, including infrared band assignment and structural refinement of organic molecules in the insoluble fraction. We find that the overall proportion that cannot be analysed by gas chromatography accounts for 85&#8211;90% in birch tar. This phase consists of polymerised molecules with a structure analogous to asphaltenes but containing a significantly greater amount of oxygen-related functional groups. Our findings have implications for understanding the viscosity, adhesiveness and stiffness of birch tar and they call for caution in applying analytical techniques that only target soluble molecules in birch tar.</description>

      <title>Genome-Wide Analysis of the Class III Peroxidase Gene Family in Physcomitrium patens and a Search for Clues to Ancient Class III Peroxidase Functions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijpb15040079</link>
      <description>Vincent P. M. Aparato, Fazle Rabbi, Taylor Madarash, Wyllie A. Brisbourne, Elizabeth I. Barker, Dae&#8208;Yeon Suh, International Journal of Plant Biology. 15(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404060254

                Plant class III peroxidases (PRXs) catalyze generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidation of various compounds including lignin precursors. PRXs function in cell wall metabolism, defense, and stress responses. However, gene redundancy and catalytic versatility have impeded detailed functional characterization of PRX genes. The genome of the model moss Physcomitrium patens harbors a relatively small number (49) of PRX genes. Conserved architecture of four exons and three &#8216;001&#8217; introns, found in some algal PRX genes and in the PpPRX family, suggests that this architecture predated divergence of the green algal and land plant lineages. The PpPRX family expanded mainly through whole-genome duplications. All duplicated pairs but one were under purifying selection and generally exhibited similar expression profiles. An expanded phylogenetic tree revealed a conserved land plant-wide clade that contained PRXs implicated in stress responses in non-lignifying cells, providing a clue to ancient functions of land plant PRXs. Functional clustering was not observed, suggesting convergent evolution of specific PRX functions (e.g., lignification) in different plant lineages. With its small complement of PRXs, P. patens may be useful for functional characterization of land plant PRXs. Several PpPRXs were proposed for further study, including PpPRX34 and PpPRX39 in the ancient land plant-wide clade.</description>

      <title>Structure-Driven Performance Enhancement in Palladium&#8211;Graphene Oxide Catalysts for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17215296</link>
      <description>Krishnamoorthy Sathiyan, Chang Gao, Toru Wada, Poulami Mukherjee, Kalaivani Seenivasan, Toshiaki Taniike, Materials. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403943964

                Graphene oxide (GO) has recently gained significant attention in electrocatalysis as a promising electrode material owing to its unique physiochemical properties such as enhanced electron transfers due to a conjugated &#960;-electron system, high surface area, and stable support for loading electroactive species, including metal nanoparticles. However, only a few studies have been directed toward the structural characteristics of GO, elaborating on the roles of oxygen-containing functional groups, the presence of defects, interlayer spacing between the layered structure, and nonuniformity in the carbon skeleton along with their influence on electrochemical performance. In this work, we aim to understand these properties in various GO materials derived from different graphitic sources. Both physiochemical and electrochemical characterization were employed to correlate the above-mentioned features and explore the effect of the location of the palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) on various GO supports for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The interaction of the functional groups has a crucial role in the Pd dispersion and its electrochemical performance. Among the different GO samples, Pd supported on GO derived from graphene nanoplate (GNP), Pd/GO-GNP, exhibits superior HER performance; this could be attributed to the optimal balance among particle size, defect density, less in-plane functionalities, and higher electrochemical surface area. This study, thus, helps to identify the optimal conditions that lead to the best performance of Pd-loaded GO, contributing to the design of more effective HER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>An advanced approach for definition of the "Milky Way
  galaxies-analogues"</title>

                Our Galaxy - the Milky Way - has certain features of the structure and evolution. The morphological, photometric, kinematic, and chemodynamical properties are usually considered in the search for the Milky Way galaxies-analogues (MWAs). The discovery of MWA galaxies with a larger number of simultaneous selection parameters and more stringent constraints on a given parameter yields a sample of MWA galaxies with properties closer to the true properties of the Milky Way. So, in general, such MW parameters as the morphological type, luminosity, color indices, structural parameters (size, bar, bulge, thin and thick disks, inner ring, halo), bulge to total ratio, stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and rotation velocity were used in various combinations for comparison with other galaxies. However, the offset of some MW features in the multiparameter space of MWAs features should be significant. The paper aims to give a brief overview of the problematics and to present our approach for studying Milky Way and MWAs matching characteristics (this project is supported by the National Research Fund of Ukraine). We propose to enlarge as much as possible the number of Milky Way features and compile various samples of MWAs in our comoving cosmological volume for their further optimization. Such features can include 3Dkinematics of star's movement in certain regions, low oxygen content on the periphery, low nuclear activity, and the lack of significant merging over the past 10 Gyrs (isolation criterion). This approach will make it possible to widely formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the detection of MWA galaxies as well as to reveal other MW multiwavelength features.</description>

      <title>Quantifying systematic uncertainties in white dwarf cooling age
  determinations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.14014</link>
      <description>Prashant Pathak, Simon Blouin, Falk Herwig, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403995443

                Cooling ages of white dwarfs are routinely determined by mapping effective temperatures and masses to ages using evolutionary models. Typically, the reported uncertainties on cooling ages only consider the error propagation of the uncertainties on the spectroscopically or photometrically determined $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. However, cooling models are themselves uncertain, given their dependence on many poorly constrained inputs. This paper estimates these systematic model uncertainties. We use MESA to generate cooling sequences of $0.5-1.0 M_{\odot}$ hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen cores under different assumptions regarding the chemical stratification of their core, the thickness of their helium envelope, their hydrogen content, and the conductive opacities employed in the calculations. The parameter space explored is constrained by the range of values predicted by a variety of stellar evolution models and inferred from asteroseismological studies. For a $0.6 M_{\odot}$ white dwarf, we find an uncertainty of 0.03 Gyr at 10,000 K (corresponding to a 5% relative uncertainty) and 0.8 Gyr at 4000 K (9%). This uncertainty is significant, as it is comparable to the age uncertainty obtained by propagating the measurement errors on $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass for a typical white dwarf. We also separately consider the potential impact of $^{22}$Ne shell distillation, which plausibly leads to an additional uncertainty of $\sim 1$ Gyr for crystallized white dwarfs. We provide a table of our simulation results that can be used to evaluate the systematic model uncertainty based on a white dwarf's $T_{\rm eff}$ and mass. We encourage its use in all future studies where white dwarf cooling ages are measured.</description>

      <title>The effects of dynamic factors inside the bubble on sono-hydrogen yield: A numerical study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0234338</link>

                The formation of H2 by introducing ultrasonic waves to liquid has been widely recognized as a way to provide a clean, efficient, and reliable source of H2, known as Sono-Hydro-Gen. H2 comes from the chemical effects of ultrasonic waves (sonochemistry) caused by the growth and collapse of acoustic cavitation bubbles. In this work, the effects of dynamic parameters (i.e., bubble temperature, the amount of water vapor trapped inside the bubble, and collapse time) in the evolution of cavitation bubbles on H2 production are studied numerically. For an oxygen bubble, computational simulations are performed for the wide range of acoustic amplitudes (1.5&#8211;3 atm), ultrasonic frequencies (140&#8211;515 kHz), and ambient radii (0.25&#8211;20 &#956;m), considering 22 reversible chemical reactions and 10 chemical species inside the bubble. The numerical results show that the amount of water vapor has a significant effect on the bubble collapse temperature. At low excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is not enough to cause the bubble to form a strong collapse. Nevertheless, at high excitation amplitudes, the amount of water vapor is too much to reduce the bubble temperature. There exist optimal values of bubble temperature and amount of water vapor for H2 production. The optimal bubble temperatures are 5267, 4813, 4626, and 3856 K, corresponding to H2 productions of 4.21 &#215; 10&#8722;18, 1.29 &#215; 10&#8722;18, 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;19, and 8.48 &#215; 10&#8722;20 mol, respectively, at ultrasonic frequencies of 140, 213, 355, and 515 kHz. No matter what the excitation parameters are, the optimal water vapor fraction is 0.78 &#177; 0.04 for H2 production. The obtained results of the present work can provide guidelines for H2 production in acoustic cavitation.</description>

                We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z=4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* = 1.4$\times$10^{10} M$_\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\beta$ luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.</description>

      <title>A 45-year hydrological and planktonic time series in the South Bight of the North Sea</title>

                Abstract. This article presents a 45-year data series (from 1978 to 2023) acquired under the IGA (&#8220;Impact des Grands Am&#233;nagements&#8221; in French; Impacts of Major Developments) program, conducted by Ifremer for EDF (&#201;lectricit&#233; de France, the French multinational electricity utility company). The IGA program was established to monitor the ecological and environmental quality of the coastal area surrounding the Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), located in the southern bight of the North Sea. The main objective of this program is to assess medium- and long-term environmental evolution by providing means to identify possible changes in the local marine habitats. Since 1978, the IGA program has measured key parameters, including temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, chlorophyll-a concentrations, as well as the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. These measurements have been taken at different sampling stations around the NPP, including the &#8220;Canal d&#8217;amen&#233;e&#8221; sampling station, for which hydrological and biological characteristics are considered as representative of broader coastal area of the southern bight of the North Sea. This data paper provides an overview of the main statistical characteristics of the time series, including long-term trends and shifts analysis. Despite the importance and length of this dataset, one of the longest available for this region, its application in advancing knowledge of hydrological and biological processes has been surprisingly limited. The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to the scientific community, stakeholders, and society to help decipher the local and global influence of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. Since all the main statistics and patterns are still available thanks to our analysis, the user should be able to use this data and combine it with other sources (in situ, satellite, modelling), in order to dive into deeper analyses, and to investigate new key scientific challenges as well as more specific ones.</description>

      <title>New Horizons in Micro/Nanoplastic-Induced Oxidative Stress: Overlooked Free Radical Contributions and Microbial Metabolic Dysregulations in Anaerobic Digestion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c08865</link>

                Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) is highly toxic to microbes. However, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and metabolic regulation within anaerobic guilds remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of environmentally relevant levels of polypropylene (PP)-MPs/NPs on oxidative stress and microbial ecology during anaerobic digestion (AD). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that PP-MPs/NPs elevated the concentrations of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) and derived hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). EPFRs were identified as the primary contributors to &#8226;OH generation, as evidenced by a high Spearman correlation coefficient (r = 0.884, p &lt; 0.001) and free radical-quenching studies. The formation of &#8226;OH enhanced ROS production by 86.2&#8211;100.9%, resulting in decreased cellular viability and methane production (by 37.5&#8211;50.5%) at 100 mg/g TS PP-MPs/NPs. Genome-centric metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses suggested that PP-MPs/NPs induced the reassembly of community structures, re-evolution of functional traits, and remodeling of interspecies interactions. Specifically, PP-MPs/NPs induced a shift in methanogen consortia from hydrogenotrophic Methanofollis sp. to acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic Methanothrix soehngenii, primarily because of the latter's diverse ingestion patterns, electron bifurcation complexes, and ROS-scavenging abilities. Downregulation of genes associated with antioxidative defense systems (i.e., sodN, katA, and osmC) and ROS-driven redox signal transduction pathways (c-di-AMP and phosphorylation signaling pathways) provided insights into the mechanisms underlying ROS-induced microbial metabolic dysregulation. Our findings enhance the understanding of microbial ecological and metabolic traits under MPs/NPs stressors, facilitating the control of MPs/NPs toxicity and the stabilization of AD processes.</description>

                ABSTRACT A novel catalyst material named Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH was successfully developed and applied in a hydrogen&#8208;promoted Fenton system for the efficient catalytic oxidation of the widely used antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP). The UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH, as the carrier of catalyst in this work, was synthesized through a solvothermal method. The Pd 0 nanoparticle, as the active center of the catalyst, was loaded onto its surface by the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy. The results showed that the composite Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH demonstrated excellent catalytic performance during the reaction, achieving over 97% of TMP removal efficiency within 180 min under optimal conditions under the condition of only trace of iron without adding H 2 O 2 . This may be attributed to the fact that the [H], as a clean and efficient reducing agent, can be utilized to accelerate the regeneration of Fe 2+ in the Fenton reaction, as well as in the in&#8208;situ regeneration of H 2 O 2 . The key parameters affecting the removal efficiency of TMP, including the initial pH and concentration of Fe 2+ , the dosage of the synthesized material, the flow rate of H 2 and the stirring speed were investigated systematically. The Pd/UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;2OH exhibited high stability and reusability, maintaining over 82% of its initial degradation efficiency of TMP after six reaction cycles. The mechanistic insight revealed that the system primarily relied on the generation of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) for the degradation of TMP, which was verified through quenching experiments and electron spin resonance (ESR). The degradation pathway of TMP was elucidated by analyzing intermediates and the reduction in total organic carbon (TOC). This research offers novel conceptual insights into the evolution and application of advanced oxidation technologies, efficient degradation of emerging pollutants, and expansion of pathways for hydrogen resource utilization.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Tuning electrolyte properties is a widely recognized strategy to enhance activity and selectivity in electrocatalysis, drawing increasing attention in this domain. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, debates persist about how various electrolyte components influence electrocatalytic reactions. We offer a concise review focusing on current discussions, especially the contentious roles of cations. This article further examines how different factors affect the interfacial solvent structure, particularly the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, and delves into the microscopic kinetics of electron and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. We also discuss the overarching influence of solvents from a kinetic modeling perspective, aiming to develop a robust correlation between electrolyte structure and reactivity. Lastly, we summarize ongoing research challenges and suggest potential directions for future studies on electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis. Key Scientists In 1956, Marcus theory was developed to describe the mechanism of outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer (OS&#8208;ET). In 1992, Nocera et al. directly measured proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics for the first time, and their subsequent research in 1995 investigated the effects of proton motion on electron transfer (ET) kinetics. In 1999 and 2000, Hammes&#8208;schiffer et al. developed the multistate continuum theory for multiple charge reactions and deduced the rate expressions for nonadiabatic PCET reactions in solution, laying the theoretical foundation for the analysis of PCET kinetics in electrochemical processes. In 2006, Saveant et al. verified the concerted proton and electron transfer (CPET) mechanism in the oxidation of phenols coupled with intramolecular amine&#8208;driven proton transfer (PT). Their subsequent work in 2008 reported the pH&#8208;dependent pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenols. Electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have gained emphasis in recent years. In 2009, Markovic's pioneering work proposed non&#8208;covalent interactions between hydrated alkaline cations and adsorbed OH species in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In 2011, Markovic et al. significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline solution by improving water dissociation, which was assumed to dominate the sluggish HER kinetics in such media. In comparation, Yan et al. applied hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory in 2015 to explain the pH&#8208;dependent HER/HOR activity. Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR). In 2016 and 2017, Karen Chan et al. introduced the electric field generated by solvated cations to explain the cation effects on electrochemical CO2RR. Conversely, in 2021, Koper et al. suggested that short&#8208;range electrostatic interactions between partially desolvated metal cations and CO 2 stabilized CO 2 and promoted CO 2 RR. Recent researches have combined the exploration of the electrical double layer (EDL) structure with theoretical analysis of PCET kinetics. In 2019, Huang et al. developed a microscopic Hamiltonian model to quantitatively understand the sluggish hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In 2021, two meticulous studies from Shao&#8208;Horn's group analyzed the effects of cations on reorganization energy and the impacts of hydrogen bonds between proton donors and acceptors on proton tunneling kinetics, respectively. Electrolyte effects on proton transport process were researched in recent years. In 2022, Hu et al. and Chen et al. proposed that the cation&#8208;induced electric field distribution and pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen bonding network connectivity played essential roles in proton transport, separately.</description>
