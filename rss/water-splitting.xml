      <title>Correlation Between Conductivity and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity in Perovskite Oxides CaMnO3-&#948;, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; and SrMnO3-&#948;</title>

      <description>Amara Martinson, Mandy Guinn, Peter Mortensen, Ram Krishna Hona, Sustainable Chemistry. 6(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406324549

                The perovskite oxides CaMnO3-&#948;, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948;, and SrMnO3-&#948; were synthesized in air using a solid-state method, and their structural, electrical, and electrocatalytic properties were studied in relation to their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Iodometric titration showed &#948; values of 0.05, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively, indicating that Mn is predominantly in the 4+ oxidation state across all materials, consistent with prior reports. Detailed characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodometric titration, and variable-temperature conductivity measurements. Four-point probe DC measurements revealed that CaMnO3-&#948; (&#948; = 0.05) has a semiconductive behavior over a temperature range from 25 &#176;C to 300 &#176;C, with its highest conductivity attributed to polaron activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH was employed to assess OER catalytic performance, which correlated with room-temperature conductivity. CaMnO3-&#948; exhibited superior catalytic activity, followed by Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; and SrMnO3-&#948;, demonstrating that increased conductivity enhances OER performance. The conductivity trend, CaMnO3-&#948; &gt; Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; &gt; SrMnO3-&#948;, aligns with OER activity, underscoring a direct link between electronic transport properties and catalytic efficiency within this series.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Reaction Synthesis of CoSb2O6-Based Electrodes Towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes: Effects of Calcination Time and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15010068</link>
      <description>Francesco Vanzetti, Hilmar Guzm&#225;n, Simelys Hern&#225;ndez, Catalysts. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406325851

                Mitigating global warming necessitates transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers like hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production via electrocatalysis requires high-performance, stable anode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to support the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts is therefore crucial, particularly for acidic electrolytes, to avoid reliance on scarce and expensive metals such as Ir and Ru. This study investigates a low-cost, solvent-free solid-state synthesis of CoSb2O6, focusing on the influence of calcination time and temperature. Six samples were prepared and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and electrochemical techniques. A non-pure CoSb2O6 phase was observed across all samples. Electrochemical testing revealed good short-term stability; however, all samples exhibited Tafel slopes exceeding 200 mV dec&#8722;1 and overpotentials greater than 1 V. The sample calcined at 600 &#176;C for 6 h showed the best performance, with the lowest Tafel slope and overpotential, attributed to its high CoSb2O6 content and maximized {110} facet exposure. This work highlights the role of calcination protocols in developing Co-based OER catalysts and offers insights for enhancing their electrocatalytic properties.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction efficiency of sol&#8211;gel synthesized SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 catalysts through optimized ball milling and acid leaching</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0242496</link>
      <description>D.Z. Yang, Nicolai Sage Andreas, Ankit K. Yadav, Kyriakos C. Stylianou, Zhenxing Feng, APL Energy. 3(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406329854

                High-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes are critical for electrochemical water splitting in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, a clean fuel for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Among OER catalysts, solid-state synthesized SrCo1&#8722;xIrxO3 has demonstrated superior activity compared to commercial standards, such as IrO2 and RuO2. However, the solid-state synthesis process is economically inefficient for industrial use due to the potential for impurities and low yield of the final product. In addition, the requirement for electrochemical cycling to activate the catalyst introduces contaminations and uncertainties for industrial applications. In this study, a modified solution-based sol&#8211;gel method was employed to produce SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 (SCIO) with high purity and yield. Subsequent ball milling and acid leaching treatments were applied, resulting in a catalyst with higher efficiency than those activated solely by electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical analysis and physical characterizations of our SCIO catalyst after ex-situ post-synthesis treatments show a similar active phase in composition and structure to those obtained through in situ electrochemical cycling and activation. Our approach simplifies the preparation process, making the catalyst ready for direct use in PEM electrolyzers without further treatment, offering a promising solution for producing high-performance, industrial-scale OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dual&#8208;Functionality in N&#8208;doped Defective Carbon: Unveiling Active Sites for Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202411035</link>
      <description>Sakshi Bhardwaj, A. J. Pathak, Sabuj Kanti Das, Prasenjit Das, Ranjit Thapa, Ramendra Sundar Dey, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406340062

                Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in energy conversion and storage technologies. The precise identification of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. However, this remains a challenging endeavor. Here, it is demonstrated that metal&#8208;free N&#8208;doped defective carbon material derived from triazene derivative exhibits excellent bifunctional activity, achieving a notable &#916;E value of 0.72 V. Through comprehensive X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopic analyses, the active sites responsible for oxygen electrocatalysis are elucidated, resolving a long&#8208;standing issue. Specifically, pyridinic&#8208;N sites are crucial for ORR, while graphitic&#8208;N are good for OER. A predictive model utilizing &#960;&#8208;electron descriptors further aids in identifying these sites, with theoretical insights aligning with experimental results. Additionally, in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy provides clarity on reaction intermediates for both reactions. This research paves the way for developing metal&#8208;free, site&#8208;specific electrocatalysts for practical applications in energy technologies.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting is a pivotal technology for storing intermittent electricity from renewable sources into hydrogen fuel. However, its overall energy efficiency is impeded by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In the quest to design high-performance anode catalysts for driving the OER under non-acidic conditions, iron (Fe) has emerged as a crucial element. Although the profound impact of adventitious electrolyte Fen+ species on OER catalysis had been reported forty years ago, recent interest in tailoring the electrode-electrolyte interface has spurred studies on the controlled introduction of Fe ions into the electrolyte to improve OER performance. During the catalytic process, scenarios where the rate of Fen+ deposition on a specific host material outruns that of dissolution pave the way for establishing highly efficient and dynamically stable electrochemical interfaces for long-term steady operation. This review systematically summarizes recent endeavors devoted to elucidating the behaviors of in situ Fe(aq.) incorporation, the role of incorporated Fe sites in the OER, and critical factors influencing the interplay between the electrode surface and Fe ions in the electrolyte environment. Finally, unexplored issues related to comprehensively understanding and leveraging the dynamic exchange of Fen+ at the interface for improved OER catalysis are summarized.</description>

                Abstract Exploring highlyefficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is a challenging butnecessary task for development of green and renewable energy. Herein, PtIrFeCoNi high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoflowers (HEA NFs) withstrong 3d&#8208;5d orbital hybridization were fabricated to achieve highly efficientoverall water splitting at high current density. The Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs achieved a 57.52&#8208;fold higher than commercial IrO 2 in turnoverfrequency (TOF) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Besides, its TOF value forhydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was 2.11&#8208;fold higher than that of commercialPt/C. The cell voltages based on Pt 26 Ir 7 Fe 13 Co 22 Ni 32 HEA NFs for overall water splitting were only 1.594 V and 1.861 V at currentdensities of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and 500 mA cm &#8722;2 , which weresignificantly lower than those of Pt/C</description>

      <title>Interstitial Doping in Ultrafine Nanocrystals for Efficient and Durable Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202424195</link>

                Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9 nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62 and 237 mV for the HER and OER at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                Transition metal&#8208;based catalysts with high efficiency and stability for overall water splitting (OWS) offer significant potential for reducing green hydrogen production costs. Utilizing sputtering deposition technology, we propose a deposition&#8208;diffusion strategy to fabricate heterojunction coatings composed of ultrafine FeCoNi&#8208;C&#8208;N transition metal interstitial solid solution (TMISS) nanocrystals and amorphous nitrided carbon (NC) on the pre&#8208;deposited NC micro column arrays. The diffusion of C and N atoms results in the formation of uniformly distributed TMISS nanocrystals, with an average diameter of ~1.9 nm, thus maximizing atomic utilization. The unique crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterojunction interface enhances electrocatalytic stability. Furthermore, the electronic regulation of metal sites by interstitial C and N atoms not only optimizes the adsorption&#8208;dissociation process in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also accelerates the surface reconstruction of hydroxyl oxides to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared coating achieved overpotentials of only 62 and 237 mV for the HER and OER at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolytes, and exhibited excellent OWS performance and long&#8208;term stability at high current densities. This work presents a new perspective for synthesizing TMISS nanocrystals and promotes their application in bifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Electrocatalytic Activity and Corrosion Resistance of CoCrFeNi and MnCrFeNi Thin Films by Anodization</title>

                Abstract Transition metal oxides like Co, Ni, and Mn are promising alternatives to noble metals such as Pt for oxygen electrocatalysis in green energy. Alloying these metals forms multicomponent catalysts with compelling properties. In this study, CoCrFeNi and MnCrFeNi thin films are synthesized using High&#8208;Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) and their catalytic activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR), the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and corrosion resistance in 1 molar (1 M) potassium hydroxide (KOH) are evaluated. MnCrFeNi films exhibit a fine&#8208;grained single face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) phase, while CoCrFeNi films have larger grains and multiple phases. ORR on CoCrFeNi follows a 2+1 electron transfer pathway, producing hydroxide radicals, while MnCrFeNi exhibits a 2&#8208;electron pathway, yielding hydrogen peroxide. Anodization reduces the CoCrFeNi overpotential from 0.9 to 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), comparable to platinum and iridium catalysts (Pt/C, Ir/C). Anodization also shifts CoCrFeNi ORR to a 2&#8208;electron pathway. In situ Raman spectroscopy detects no ORR intermediates, but nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) appears during OER. Substituting Mn for Co increases corrosion resistance by raising the corrosion potential. All films show passive behavior during polarization, demonstrating their potential for corrosion protection and electrocatalysis in green energy applications.</description>

      <title>Induction of Nanoscale Magnetic Ordering in Non&#8208;Ferrous Layered Double Hydroxides: Stabilizing Spintronic Electrocatalysis</title>

                Abstract Inducing magnetic ordering in a non&#8208;ferrous layered double hydroxides (LDHs) instigates higher spin polarization, which leads to enhanced efficiency during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In nano&#8208;sized magnetic materials, the concept of elongated grains drives domain alignment under the application of an external magnetic field. Hence, near the solid electrode interface, modified magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) positively impacts the electrocatalytic ability of non&#8208;ferrous nanocatalysts. Consequently, significant improvement in the water&#8208;splitting kinetics can be obtained by using even low magnetic fields. At 100 Gauss, 20% and 10% decrement in the overpotential is reported for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are also presented to explain the thermodynamics of the HER/OER processes. It is established that the Gibbs energy of the process can reduce the exchange energy barrier by using dopant like cobalt. The additional cobalt metal active site have the highest probability for adsorption of reactive intermediates during HER and OER, which results in higher efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dual Active Sites of Ni/Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Ru Heterointerface for Robust Electrocatalytic Alkaline Seawater Splitting</title>

                Abstract Constructing bifunctional electrocatalysts through the synergistic effect of diverse metal sites is crucial for achieving high&#8208;efficiency and steady overall water splitting. Herein, a &#8220;dual&#8208;HER/OER&#8208;sites&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is proposed to regulate dominant active sites, wherein Ni/Co(OH) 2 &#8208;Ru heterogeneous catalysts formed on nickel foam (NF) demonstrate remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the potentials@10 mA cm &#8722;2 of Ni/Co(OH) 2 &#8208;Ru@NF for overall alkaline water and seawater splitting are only 1.36 and 1.41 V, respectively, surpassing those of commercial RuO 2 @NF and Pt/C@NF. The Ru site is identified as the primary active site for HER by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, while the Co(OH) 2 site displays the minimal rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier (RDS) and functions as the main active site for OER. This study offers novel perspectives on the rational utilization of diverse metal species&#8217; catalytic capabilities for developing dual active sites multifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

                The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H-down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record-breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10 mA = 0.85/1.65 V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500 h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere-scale zinc-air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0 A and 1.0 Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large-scale energy storage.</description>

                Abstract Durable and highly active oxygen electrocatalysts are crucial to the large-scale application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this work, we utilized the N4 unit in Pc molecule to trap the tungsten atoms scratched off from the tungsten carbide milling balls and placed the obtained W-N4 unit close adjacent to the Fe-N4 units in FePc, resulting in highly active Fe-N4/W-N4 diatomic sites with well-pronounced 3d-5d hybrid for efficient and durable oxygen electrocatalysis. The electron distribution of the Fe-N4 site is optimized by the neighboring W-N4 site, which facilitates the O2 activation and the desorption of *OH and enhances the catalytic activity of the Fe-N4 site. Meanwhile, the unsaturated 5d orbitals and tunable valence of the W atoms could modulate the electronic state of the Fe species, prevent leaching, and further enhance the catalytic stability. The resulting zinc-air battery with Fe,W-N-C air cathode exhibited unprecedented cycling stability and repeatability for over 10,000 hours. This remarkable stability improvement not only provides new perspectives for the commercialization of ultra-stable zinc-air batteries but also highlights the critical step in developing 5d metal-boosted 3d metal active sites to fabricate efficient oxygen electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Acidic oxygen evolution reaction via lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism: progress and challenges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20517/energymater.2024.62</link>
      <description>Yuhua Xie, Fang Luo, Zehui Yang, Energy Materials. 5(3)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406405423

                The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) plays a critical role in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as it provides a more efficient catalytic pathway compared to the conventional adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM). LOM effectively lowers the energy threshold of the reaction and accelerates the reaction rate by exciting the oxygen atoms in the catalyst lattice to directly participate in the OER process. In recent years, with the increase of in-depth understanding of LOM, researchers have developed a variety of iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts, as well as non-precious metal oxide catalysts, and optimized their performance in acidic OER through different strategies. However, LOM still faces many challenges in practical applications, including the long-term stability of the catalysts, the precise modulation of the active sites, and the application efficiency in real electrolysis systems. Here, we review the application of LOM in acidic OER, analyze its difference with the traditional AEM mechanism and the new oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) mechanism, discuss the experimental and theoretical validation methods of the LOM pathway, and prospect the future development of LOM in electrocatalyst design and energy conversion, aiming to provide fresh perspectives and strategies for solving the current challenges.</description>

                Hydrogen is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable energy. To commercialize water electrolysis technology, the development of high-performance OER catalysts is essential. This study utilizes seawater as an electrolyte to enhance economic viability and employs Ni-based materials instead of precious metals like RuO2. Ni-based Hofmann-type coordination polymers were synthesized via plasma engineering and transformed into 2D Ni nanoplates through thermal treatment. These nanoplates demonstrated exceptional OER performance in both alkaline and alkaline seawater electrolytes, achieving lower overpotentials compared to that of RuO2. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that seawater's diverse cations and anions increased the disorder of the active phase (NiOOH) through intercalation, suppressing Ni oxidation and active oxygen formation, which reduced OER activity. In an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) under alkaline seawater, Ni nanoplates exhibited much lower cell voltages of 267 and 393 mV at current densities of 500 and 1000 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, compared to RuO2. Notably, the cell voltage showed negligible changes over 90 h during a durability test at 100 mA cm&#8211;2. This work highlights Ni-based Hofmann-type coordination polymers and their derivatives as efficient OER catalysts for hydrogen generation.</description>

                Recently, cobalt-based oxides have received considerable attention as an alternative to expensive and scarce iridium for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Although the reported materials demonstrate promising durability, they are not entirely intact, calling for fundamental research efforts to understand the processes governing the degradation of such catalysts. To this end, this work studies the dissolution mechanism of a model Co3O4 porous catalyst under different electrochemical conditions using online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (online ICP-MS), identical location scanning transmission electron microscopy (IL-STEM), and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Despite the high thermodynamics tendency reflected in the Pourbaix diagram, it is shown that the cobalt dissolution kinetics is sluggish and can be lowered further by modifying the electrochemical protocol. For the latter, identified in this study, several (electro)chemical reaction pathways that lead to the dissolution of Co3O4 must be considered. Hence, this work uncovers the transient character of cobalt dissolution and provides valuable insights that can help to understand the promising stability of cobalt-based materials in already published works and facilitate the knowledge-driven design of novel, stable, abundant catalysts toward the OER in an acidic environment.</description>

                Abstract The oxygen spillover on the metal/oxide electrocatalysts interface acts as an essential role in promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, oxygen spillover mechanisms and corresponding regulatory strategies are still unclear for addressing slow OH&#8208;migration kinetics. Herein, an interface is constructed between Iridium (Ir) and Niobium (Nb)&#8208;doped Titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) with abundant oxygen vacancies area by plasma processing, enabling oxygen spillover from the metal Ir to supports. The optimized Ir/Nb&#8208;doped TiO 2 with a significant OER activity (&#951; = 253 mV) and durability in acids compared to commercial IrO 2 . In situ experiments combined with theoretical computations reveal the presence of interfacial oxygen vacancies not only regulates the Ir structure toward boosted activity but also constructs a directional spillover pathway from Ir to interfacial oxygen vacancies area and then TiO 2 via the OH * &#8208;filling route, which strikingly mitigates the OH * migration barriers. In addition, the optimized Ir/Nb&#8208;doped TiO 2 exhibits excellent performance (1.69 V/1.0 A cm &#8722;2 @80 &#176;C) and long&#8208;term stability (&#8776;500 h@1.0 A cm &#8722;2 ) with practical potential in PEMWEs. This work provides a unique insight into the role of oxygen spillover, paving the way for designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts for PEMWEs.</description>

      <title>Combining Cocatalyst and Oxygen Vacancy to Synergistically Improve Fe2O3 Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation Performance</title>

                Considering the poor conductivity of Fe2O3 and the weak oxygen evolution reaction associated with it, surface hole accumulation leads to electron hole pair recombination, which inhibits the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the Fe2O3 photoanode. Therefore, the key to improving the PEC water oxidation performance of the Fe2O3 photoanode is to take measures to improve the conductivity of Fe2O3 and accelerate the reaction kinetics of surface oxidation. In this work, the PEC performances of Fe2O3 photoanodes are synergistically improved by combining loaded an FeOOH cocatalyst and oxygen vacancy doping. Firstly, amorphous FeOOH layers are successfully prepared on Fe2O3 nanostructures through simple photoassisted electrodepositon. Then oxygen vacancies are introduced into FeOOH-Fe2O3 through plasma vacuum treatment, which reduces the content of Fe-O (OL) and Fe-OH (-OH), jointly promoting the generation of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancy can increase the concentration of most carriers in Fe2O3 and form photo-induced charge traps, promoting the separation of electron holes and enhancing the conductivity of Fe2O3. The other parts of -OH act as oxygen evolution catalysts to reduce the reaction obstacle of water oxidation and promote the transfer of holes to the electrode/electrolyte interface. The performance of FeOOH-Fe2O3 after plasma vacuum treatment has been greatly improved, and the photocurrent density is about 1.9 times higher than that of the Fe2O3 photoanode. The improvement in the water oxidation performance of PEC is considered to be the synergistic effect of the cocatalyst and oxygen vacancy. All outstanding PEC response characteristics show that the modification of the cocatalyst and oxygen vacancy doping represent a favorable strategy for synergistically improving Fe2O3 photoanode performance.</description>

                Renewable hydrogen generation from water electrolysis offers a viable path to decarbonization if the costs can be reduced. The iridium-based anode catalyst is one of the most expensive components in electrolyzers. We propose reducing iridium usage by substituting Ir with Co, a more affordable metal, in the mixed oxide phase to enhance the catalytic activity while minimizing Ir consumption. A modified surfactant-assisted Adams fusion synthesis technique was developed as a scalable method for producing IrCo oxide nanoparticles. The synthesized material outperforms the commercial baseline, iridium oxide with carbon (IrOx_C), in both acidic and alkaline media. Acid etching (IrCo_ae) further enhances activity by selectively removing Co to expose more active sites. IrCo_ae achieved a significantly lower overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 compared to IrOx_C, with reductions of approximately 18% under acidic conditions and 14% under alkaline conditions. This work demonstrates that the proposed synthesis method enables efficient Ir utilization and can be adapted to enhance catalyst stability for renewable hydrogen production.</description>

                Efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with fast kinetics, high efficiency, and stability are essential for scalable green production of hydrogen. The rational design and fabrication of catalysts play a decisive role in their catalytic behavior. This work presents a high-entropy catalyst, FeCoNiCuMo-O, synthesized via carbothermal shock. Synergistic optimization of the adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) was realized and demonstrated through the combination of in situ spectra/mass spectrometry and chemical probe analysis in FeCoNiCuMo-O. Furthermore, the robust stability is reinforced by the inherent properties conferred by the high-entropy design. The catalyst exhibits outstanding performance metrics, featuring an exceptionally low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec&#8211;1, a low overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a commendable endurance (a mere 2.2% voltage decline after a 240-h continuous chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm&#8211;2). This study advances the development of efficient, durable OER electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>IrOx Supported on Submicron-Sized Anatase TiO2 as a Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15010079</link>
      <description>Josep Boter-Carbonell, Carlos Calabr&#233;s-Casellas, M. Sarret, Teresa Andreu, Pere Llu&#305;&#769;s Cabot, Catalysts. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406465519

                Ir-based catalysts are the best in terms of activity and stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in proton exchange water electrolysis. Due to their cost, efforts have been made to decrease their load without a loss of activity. In this paper, Ir nanoparticles measuring 2&#8211;3 nm were loaded on TiO2 anatase supports of submicrometric size in different amounts using the microwave polyol method to optimize their mass activity. Using anatase particles with a diameter of about 100 nm and titania nanotubes (TNTs), Ir/TiO2 catalysts with Ir contents of 5, 10, 20, and 40 wt.% were synthesized and characterized via structural and electrochemical techniques. It was shown that the amount of Ir must be regulated to obtain continuous coverage on titania with strong Ir&#8211;TiO2 interactions which, for the 100 nm diameter anatase, is limited to about 20 wt.%. A higher percentage of Ir over 40 wt.% can be dispersed over the TNTs. Exceeding one layer of coverage leads to a decrease in the catalyst&#8217;s utilization. Ir/TiO2(10:90), Ir/TiO2(20:80), and Ir/TiO2(40:60) presented the highest pseudocapacitive currents per unit of Ir mass. The electrochemical active areas and mass activities for these later catalysts were also the highest compared to Ir/TiO2(05:95), Ir/TNT(40:60), and the unsupported catalysts and increased from 40 to 10 wt.% Ir. They also presented the lowest overpotentials of about 300 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER, with Ir/TiO2(10:90) presenting the best specific activities and surface turnover frequencies, thus showing that the size of the support can be regulated to decrease the Ir content of the catalyst without a loss of activity.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved spectroscopy uncovers deprotonation-induced reconstruction in oxygen-evolution NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxides</title>

                Transition-metal layered double hydroxides are widely utilized as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), undergoing dynamic transformation into active oxyhydroxides during electrochemical operation. Nonetheless, our understanding of the non-equilibrium structural changes that occur during this process remains limited. In this study, utilizing in situ energy-dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy and machine learning analysis, we reveal the occurrence of deprotonation and elucidate the role of incorporated iron in facilitating the transition from nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) into its active oxyhydroxide. Our findings demonstrate that iron substitution promotes deprotonation process within NiFe LDH, resulting in the preferential removal of protons from the specific bridged hydroxyl group (Ni2+-OH-Fe3+) linked to edge-sharing [NiO6] and [FeO6] octahedron. This deprotonation behavior drives the formation of high-valence Ni3+&#948; species (0 &lt;&#948; &lt; 1), which subsequently serve as the active sites, thereby ensuring efficient oxygen evolution activity. This approach offers high-resolution insights of dynamic structural evolution, overcoming the limitations of extended acquisition times and advancing our understanding of OER mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Bifunctional NiFe-MOF Array Electrode for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>

                Electrocatalytically converting nitrates in sewage to ammonia, which can not only achieve the purpose of eliminating sewage but also obtaining valuable ammonia, is an effective supplement to the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Although significant progress has been made in cathodic catalyst design, the overall ammonia electrolysis from nitrate reduction is still restricted by the anodic oxygen evolution heavily relying on noble-based catalysts. Herein, a bimetallic NiFe-MOF nanosheet array electrode is fabricated and serves as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for nitrate reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The introduction of Fe to Ni-MOF facilitates the formation of a nanosheet structure with higher electrochemical active surface area, as well as provides synergetic NiFe sites. The NiFe-MOF electrode reaches a greatly enhanced ammonia yield rate of 0.94 mmol cm&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 90.8% at the cathode and &#8722;0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, as well as an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction with a declined overpotential of 424 mV at 50 mA cm&#8211;2. As a bifunctional catalyst in the overall electrocatalysis, the performance of NiFe-MOF in the nitrate reduction reaction is comparable with that using Pt mesh as a counter electrode.</description>

      <title>Advances in Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts via Direct Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Radical Coupling Pathway</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202416362</link>

                Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO 2 /N 2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.</description>

                The aqueous iron ion batteries (AIIBs) are an attractive option for large-scale energy storage applications. However, the inadequate plating and stripping of Fe2+ ions underscore the need to explore more suitable cathode materials. Herein, we optimize the structure of tunnel-like VO2 nanosheets by introducing Mn2+ ion intercalation as a cathode material to enhance their performance in AIIBs. Mn2+ serves as a stabilizing pillar for VO2, which brings some oxygen vacancies to provide extra electrochemically active sites, and accelerates the reversible (de)insertion of Fe2+ ions. In addition, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the introduction of Mn2+ reduces the band gap of VO2 and also decreases the electrostatic interaction between Fe2+ and VO2. Consequently, the VO2 with interlayer Mn2+ pillars (5% MVO) electrodes exhibit a remarkable capacity of 284.32 mAh g&#8211;1 at a current density of 0.1 A g&#8211;1 and demonstrate excellent cycle life, maintaining 81.7% of their capacity at 1.0 A g&#8211;1 after 600 cycles. Therefore, these results offer a promising choice for the cathode material to achieve outstanding electrochemical performance in AIIBs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Electronic Structure of IrO&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; Sub-2 nm Clusters via Tunable Metal Support Interaction for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06411</link>

                Iridium-based electrocatalysts are the most promising candidates for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Considering their high cost and scarcity, it is imperative to maximize atom utilization and enhance the intrinsic activity of iridium. In this work, IrOx sub-2 nm clusters are stabilized on TiO2 supports via metal support interaction (MSI) induced by vacancy defects in TiO2. The strength of MSI is readily tuned by the type of vacancies: oxygen vacancies in TiO2 (VO-TiO2) induce the adsorbed MSI with relatively weak strength, while titanium vacancies in TiO2 (VTi-TiO2) lead to the strong embedded MSI. The tunable MSI further modulates the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters. IrOx/VO-TiO2 with adsorbed MSI exhibits an optimized electronic structure with a downshifted d-band center of IrOx, resulting in a reduced binding energy with oxygen and a low energy barrier of the rate-determining step for OER. Consequently, IrOx/VO-TiO2 delivers an activity twice that of commercial IrO2 and a good stability for 120 h in a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Our study provides a guideline for the rational design of acidic OER catalysts based on modulating the electronic structure of IrOx sub-2 nm clusters via tunable MSI.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of &#946;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via Ir/Ru Co-substitution for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c05989</link>

                The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is severely limited by the poor stability, low activity, and high cost of available catalysts. Enhancing intrinsic activity while maintaining stability and reducing reliance on precious metals is crucial. The typical adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) leads to high overpotentials and low activity, making the transition to alternative mechanisms, such as the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) or oxide path mechanism (OPM), highly desirable due to their lower overpotentials. Here, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental validation to enhance the activity and stability of &#946;-MnO2 via co-substitution with ruthenium (Ru) and iridium (Ir), enabling the transition from AEM to OPM. DFT calculations reveal that AEM is hindered by the weak nucleophilicity of water, while LOM suffers from high kinetic barriers due to structural distortions. In contrast, OPM demonstrates a significantly lower kinetic barrier, facilitated by the synergistic interaction between Ru and Ir. Experimentally, IrRuMnOx was synthesized through co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, showing an 80-fold improvement in mass activity and a 96-fold increase in stability compared to commercial IrO2, with minimal noble metal leaching, as confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). IrRuMnOx exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 475 mV at 1 A&#183;cm&#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 44.26 mV&#183;dec&#8211;1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, maintaining stable performance for over 100 h. Moreover, the IrRuMnOx-based membrane electrode, with a low Ir loading of 0.075 mgIr&#183;cm&#8211;2, achieved remarkable current densities of 1.0 A&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 1.66 V and 2.0 A&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 1.91 V at 80 &#176;C. This performance surpasses that of both unsupported and conventional supported Ir-based catalysts at comparable Ir loading levels. This study offers critical insights into OER mechanisms in acidic media and paves the way for developing efficient and durable OER electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.</description>

                Abstract Engineering nanomaterials at single&#8208;atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO 2 &#8208;based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi&#8208;RuO 2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy. This Bi&#8208;RuO 2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate&#8208;evolving mechanism on Bi&#8208;RuO 2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi 1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic&#8208;level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.</description>

                Abstract Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular&#8208;level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO 4 surfaces (Ov&#8208;BiVO 4 ), enabling interactions with the oxygen&#8208;rich ligands of MIL&#8208;101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO 4 . The Ov&#8208;BiVO 4 /MIL&#8208;101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V RHE , along with excellent stability. This high&#8208;performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov&#8208;BiVO 4 /MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Si solar cell system, achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular&#8208;level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL&#8208;101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.</description>

      <description>Stefan Speer, Sven Jovanovic, Alexandre Merlen, Francesco B&#224;rtoli, Kiran Kiran, N. Nijs-De Wolf, Andr&#233; Karl, Eva Jodat, R&#252;diger&#8208;A. Eichel, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406346003

                The study of degradation behavior of electrocatalysts in an industrial context calls for rapid and efficient analysis methods. Optical methods like Raman spectroscopy fulfil these requirements and are thus predestined for this purpose. However, the iridium utilized in proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is Raman inactive in its metallic state. This work demonstrates the high oxidation sensitivity of iridium and its utilization in analysis of catalyst materials. Laser induced oxidation Raman spectroscopy (LIORS) is established as a novel method for qualitative, chemical and structural analysis of iridium catalysts. Differences in particle sizes of iridium powders drastically change oxidation sensitivity. Oxidation of the iridium powders to IrO2 occurred at a laser power density of 0.47 &#177; 0.06 mW &#956;m-2 for the 850 &#956;m powder and at 0.12 &#177; 0.06 mW &#956;m-2 and 0.019 &#177; 0.015 mW &#956;m-2 for the 50 &#956;m and 0.7-0.9 &#956;m powders respectively. LIORS was utilized to assess possible deterioration of an iridium electrocatalyst due to operation under electrolysis. The operating electrocatalyst exhibited higher oxidation sensitivity, suggesting smaller iridium particle size due to catalyst dissolution. Peak shifts of the IrO2 signal were utilized to assess differences in transformation temperatures. The operated electrocatalyst transformed to IrO2 at lower temperature (8 cm-1 redshift) relative to the pristine catalyst (10 cm-1 redshift), demonstrating that pre-oxidation of the iridium to amorphous IrOx during electrolysis diminishes the energy barrier needed for IrO2 formation. Thus, LIORS can be utilized as a straightforward screening method for the analysis of iridium electrocatalysts in the industrial application of PEMEL.</description>

      <title>Multiple Reaction Pathways for Oxygen Evolution as a Key Factor for the Catalytic Activity of Nickel&#8211;Iron (Oxy)Hydroxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c12988</link>
      <description>Giuseppe Mattioli, Leonardo Guidoni, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406386413

                We present a comprehensive theoretical study, using state-of-the-art density functional theory simulations, of the structural and electrochemical properties of amorphous pristine and iron-doped nickel&#8211;(oxy)hydroxide catalyst films for water oxidation in alkaline solutions, referred to as NiCat and Fe:NiCat. Our simulations accurately capture the structural changes in locally ordered units, as reported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, when the catalyst films are activated by exposure to a positive potential. We emphasize the critical role of proton-coupled electron transfer in the reversible oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III/IV) during this activation. After establishing the structural models of NiCat and Fe:NiCat consistent with experimental data, we used them to explore the atomistic mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is triggered once the applied potential exceeds the overpotential required for water oxidation and oxygen production. We quantitatively compared seven OER pathways applicable to both the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) families, elucidating how iron significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Fe:NiCat compared to NiCat. Our findings suggest that simple metal&#8211;oxygen&#8211;metal motifs, common on the surface of both crystalline and amorphous metal (oxy)hydroxide films, can promote both AEM and LOM mechanisms under typical OER conditions. Furthermore, we propose that the elusive role of iron lies in the distinct behavior of Ni(IV)&#8211;O and Fe(IV)&#8211;O bonds in key intermediates preceding the formation of the O&#8211;O bond, with Fe ions lowering the potential needed to form these intermediates across the investigated pathways.</description>

      <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Via N&#8208;Doped Carbon Dots for Robust Oxygen Evolution at Large Current Density</title>

                Constructing a built-in electric field (BIEF) within heterostructures has emerged as a compelling strategy for advancing electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, the p-n type nanosheet array heterojunction Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF are successfully prepared. The variation in interaction affinity between nitrogen within N-doped carbon dots (NCDs) and Ni/Co induces charge redistribution between Co and Ni in the Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF-3 heterostructure, thereby enhancing the intensity of the BIEF, facilitating electron transfer, and markedly improving OER activity. The optimized electrocatalyst, Ni2P-NCDs-Co(OH)2-NF-3, demonstrates a remarkably low overpotential of 389 mV at 500 mA cm-2, alongsides a small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec-1, expansive electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), low impedance, outstanding stability exceeding 425 h at 500 mA cm-2, and a Faradaic efficiency of up to 96%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations elucidate the OER mechanism, revealing that the enhanced BIEF optimizes the adsorption energy of Co3+ to OH- and weakened the desorption energy of oxygen during the reaction. The work ponieeringly employed the NCDs as a regulator of the BIEF, effectively tuning field intensity and achieving superior electrocatalytic OER performance under large current density, thus charting new pathways for the development of high-efficiency oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.</description>

                Building insights into the structure&#8211;performance relationship of catalysts has been emphasized recently. However, it remains a challenge due to catalysts' various and complex structures, especially the easily overlooked influence of the support material. Here, we reveal the crucial influences of boron introduction on synthesizing 3D carbon nanotube monoliths with embedded multistate Co metals, i.e., single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles (Co-BNCNTs), by an interesting chemical blowing-assisted calcination method. The boron introduction can contribute to forming captivating boron&#8211;nitrogen pairs, shaping a 3D frame, and regulating electronic structure. The 3D Co-BNCNT monoliths present good catalytic performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at all pH values and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The theoretical calculations indicate that the B incorporation in Co-NCNTs can optimize the free energy of adsorbed hydrogen and facilitate the O2 adsorption and the protonation of the O2* species. Furthermore, the Co-BNCNTs-based zinc&#8211;air battery provides great battery performance with a high power density and discharge&#8211;charge durability.</description>

                RuO2-based materials are considered an important kind of electrocatalysts on oxygen evolution reaction and water electrolysis, but the reported discrepancies of activities exist among RuO2 electrocatalysts prepared via different processes. Herein, a highly efficient RuO2 catalysts via a facile hydrolysis-annealing approach is reported for water electrolysis. The RuO2 catalyst dealt with at 200 &#176;C (RuO2-200) performs the highest activities on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid with overpotentials of 200 mV for OER and 66 mV for HER to reach a current density of 100 mA cm-2 as well as stable operation for100 h. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations show that the activities of as-prepared RuO2 rely on the hydroxide group/lattice oxygen (OH-/O2-) ratio, size, and crystalline of RuO2. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation also reveal that the OH- would enhance the activities of RuO2 for HER and OER via modifying the electronic structure to facilitate intermediate adsorption, thereby reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. The water electrolysis by using RuO2-200 as the catalyst on both anode and cathode demonstrates a stable generation of hydrogen and oxygen with high Faradic efficiency at a current density of &#8776;30 mA cm-2 and a potential of below 1.47 V.</description>

      <title>Uniform Sub-5 nm Crystalline Nickel-Based Heterojunctions for Overall Water Splitting Electrocatalysis</title>

                Exploring a general method for constructing uniform heterostructures with sub-5 nm crystallites and dense interfaces is crucial yet challenging for advancing water electrocatalysis. Herein, a bottom-up cocrystallization strategy, involving in situ transformation of amorphous Ni&#8211;P through gas&#8211;solid reactions, is proposed to synthesize a series of nickel-based heterojunctions on carbon cloth (CC). Thereinto, interface-wealthy NiS2-Ni2P/CC with densely packed 3&#8211;4 nm crystallites demonstrates superb catalytic performance for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The electrolyzer merely requires cell voltages of 1.79 and 1.89 V to propel overall water splitting currents of 200 and 400 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, outperforming the vast majority of reported nickel-based heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations reveal that charge redistribution and electronic structure modulation optimize the hydrogen and oxygen evolution pathways at the NiS2 and Ni2P sides of the interfaces, respectively. Moreover, uniform hybridization with densely distributed heterointerfaces offers abundant active sites for electrocatalysis, pioneering an extendable approach for constructing advanced heterojunction catalysts for green hydrogen production.</description>

Herein, we present a fast flexible synthesis pathway for the preparation of a variety of different medium&#8208; and high&#8208;entropy spinel sulfides of various compositions, using a non&#8208;aqueous microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis without any H 2 S. Nanoparticulate high&#8208;entropy sulfides containing up to 8 different metal cations can be obtained after an extremely short synthesis time of only 1 min and comparatively low temperatures of 200&#8211;230&#176;C. We further demonstrate the high activity of the obtained sulfides for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</description>

                Designing bifunctional catalysts that improve the efficiency of both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) is a strategy to enhance the performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Co3O4/CoFe2O4/nitrogen-doped carbon heterostructures were synthesized as electrocatalysts using coprecipitation and calcination methods. The morphology of the composite was characterized by a hollow nanocube shape, which facilitated the exposure of active sites and provided space for Li2O2 storage. At the heterogeneous interface, electronic interactions gave rise to the interfacial charge redistribution. This redistribution not only improved the catalytic activity but also induced the generation and reversible decomposition of mixed Li2O2 and LiOH discharge products. On this basis, the specific capacity of Co3O4/CoFe2O4/nitrogen-doped carbon when used as a cathode catalyst was 8930 mAh g&#8211;1 and could be stably cycled for 118 cycles, which was an improvement over the single Co3O4 cathode.</description>

                The space charge effect induced by high-quality heterojunctions is essential for efficient electrocatalytic processes. Herein, we delicately manipulate intermolecular charge transfer by modifying substituents (-g = -CH3, -H, -NO2) with various electron donating/withdrawing capabilities in CoPc-g/CoS organic-inorganic heterostructures. CoPc-CH3, as a typical electron donor, transfers more electrons to CoS due to the presence of -CH3, forming the strongest space electric field and thus regulating the dual active sites at the interface. Furthermore, oxygen-containing intermediates preferentially adsorb on the positively charged CoPc-CH3 side, and the rapid accumulation of electrons on the CoS side decelerates catalyst dissolution at the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential, ensuring the stable OER process under the optimized adsorbate evolution mechanism. As a result, CoPc-CH3/CoS catalyst exhibits the lowest overpotential and remains stable for 150 h at 0.5 A cm-2 in the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer. The method provides a novel strategy for accurately regulating the space electric field of heterojunctions.</description>

                The incorporation of non-metal dopants can significantly enhance catalytic activity and improve stability. Furthermore, the creation of heterostructures is particularly advantageous to facilitate charge transfer and optimize electronic properties. This study presents an effective bifunctional mixed-valence Ruthenium heterostructure synthesized through a cascading process involving grinding with carbon nitride and subsequent thermal treatment. The catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance with remarkably low overpotentials of 197 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 24.8 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, with the stability exceeding 24 h at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8315;2 in acidic media. Additionally, when employed in an acidic oxygen water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer, the bifunctional catalyst demonstrates excellent activity, achieving an ultralow cell voltage of 1.53 V to sustain 10 mA cm&#8315;2. Enhanced performance is attributed to efficient charge transfer and increased exposure of active sites, providing valuable insights for the development of effective acidic water-electrolysis catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

                Electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR) to ammonia presents a promising alternative strategy to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. However, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reduces the Faradaic efficiency toward ammonia, while the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases the energy consumption. This study designs IrCu4 alloy nanoparticles as a bifunctional catalyst to achieve efficient NO3RR and OER while suppressing the unwanted HER. This is achieved by operating the NO3RR at positive potentials using the IrCu4 catalyst, which allows a Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% for NO3RR. When applied to OER catalysis, the IrCu4 alloy also shows excellent results, with a relatively low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Stable ammonia production can be achieved for 50 h in a 16 cm2 flow electrolyzer in simulated working conditions. Our research provides a pathway for optimizing NO3RR through bifunctional catalysts in a tandem approach.</description>

However, the abundance of chloride ions in seawater poses a challenge to electrocatalyst stability, underscoring the need for catalysts with exceptional durability and efficiency to facilitate effective seawater oxidation. In this study, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) was intercalated into a NiFe layered double hydroxide on nickel foam (NF/NiFe LDH), creating an advanced seawater oxidation electrocatalyst (NF/NiFe LDH@TPP) that effectively resists chloride-induced corrosion. Remarkably, the TPP-intercalated catalyst demonstrates superior kinetics and selectivity for the oxygen evolution reaction, reaching a current density of 1 A cm&#8211;2 with an overpotential as low as 385 mV, while sustaining stable seawater oxidation performance for over 500 h.</description>

                Traditional hydrometallurgy methods for recycling the spent lithium-ion battery materials face some challenges, including the complex processes, and difficulties in separating Ni/Co/Mn. To address these issues, this work proposes a simple one-pot method to achieve a high Li leaching efficiency (99.2%) and simultaneously transform the majority of Ni (99.5%) and Co (99.9%) into a high-performance multifunctional electrocatalyst (LNMCO-HS-180). LNMCO-HS-180 with single-phase structure shows a hollow microsphere morphology. LNMCO-HS-180 can efficiently catalyze the oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER), and methanol oxidation reactions (MOR), with the ORR half-wave potential of 0.732 V and, OER potential of 1.469 V at 10 mA cm-2. This is mainly attributed to the unique hollow microsphere morphology, suitable Ni/Co/Mn oxidation states, and reduction in the free energy barriers for OER and ORR. Additionally, LNMCO-HS-180 exhibits an MOR potential of only 1.43 V at 100 mA cm-2 and excellent formate selectivity (&gt;99%).</description>

      <title>High-Capacity F-Doped Na&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2.05&lt;/sub&gt; with Balanced Voltage Distribution for Decoupled Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c02741</link>
      <description>Wenchao Zhou, Liwu Zhou, Yun&#8208;Hai Wang, Qing&#8208;Yun Chen, ACS Applied Energy Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406474179

                Decoupled water electrolysis, which utilizes redox mediators to separate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in space and time, is considered a potential method for producing high-purity green hydrogen. However, there are some key challenges in decoupled water electrolysis using solid-state redox mediators, such as redox potentials, voltage distribution, capacity limitations, and material stability. Here, F-doped Na0.7MnO2.05 (NMOF) with an appropriate redox potential, high capacity, and stability was synthesized by a simple sol&#8211;gel method. The redox peak pair of NMOF was located at &#8722;0.064 V/&#8211;0.314 V (vs Hg/HgO), which is located between the onset potentials of the HER and OER. By F-doping, F&#8211;Mn bonds significantly inhibited the dissolution of Mn2+ in the electrolyte, thereby reducing the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and improving the cycling stability of Na-ion insertion and removal in Na0.7MnO2.05. NMOF prepared by adding 5 mol/% NaF at 850 &#176;C (named NMOF2) exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, with a discharge capacity of 114.3 mAh/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Using NMOF2 for decoupled water electrolysis, voltage balance distribution was achieved, and hydrogen and oxygen production was achieved at such low voltages (0.85 V for the HER process and 0.89 V for the OER process) at a current density of 5 mA/cm2. These suggest that NMOF2 could be a promising material for decoupled water electrolysis.</description>

                The scarcity of cost-effective and durable iridium-free anode electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) poses a significant challenge to the widespread application of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). To address the electrochemical oxidation and dissolution issues of Ru-based electrocatalysts, an electron-donating modification strategy is developed to stabilize WRuOx under harsh oxidative conditions. The optimized catalyst with a low Zirconium doping (Zr, 1 wt.%) enhances durability noticeably, with a 77% reduction in degradation rate in the durability test of 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 m H2SO4. When integrated into a homemade PEMWE device, the Zr-doped catalyst achieves excellent long-term stability, lasting up to 650 h at 100 mA cm&#8315;2. Additionally, the electronic modulation from the Zr modification leads to superior activity with a low overpotential of 208 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Theoretical calculation results further reveal that electron-donating Zr modification effectively suppresses Ru overoxidation and lattice oxygen participation, maintaining a robust structure during acidic OER. This modification also promotes deprotonation through stronger Br&#248;nsted acid sites, significantly improving both long-term stability and activity.</description>

                Abstract Development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial for a sustainable hydrogen economy. In this study, rapid heating of ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate by magnetic induction heating (MIH) leads to the one&#8208;step production of Ru&#8208;RuO&#8322;/C nanocomposites composed of closely integrated Ru and RuO&#8322; nanoparticles. The formation of Mott&#8208;Schottky heterojunctions significantly enhances charge transfer across the Ru&#8208;RuO 2 interface leading to remarkable electrocatalytic activities toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH. Among the series, the sample prepares at 300 A for 10 s exhibits the best performance, with an overpotential of only &#8722;31 mV for HER and +240 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 . Additionally, the catalyst demonstrates excellent durability, with minimal impacts of electrolyte salinity. With the sample as the bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.43 V is needed to reach 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 , 160 mV lower than that with a commercial 20% Pt/C and RuO&#8322;/C mixture. These results highlight the significant potential of MIH in the ultrafast synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production from seawater.</description>

                Abstract Enhancing the catalytic performance and durability of M&#8208;N&#9472;C catalyst is crucial for the efficient operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and Zn&#8208;Air batteries (ZABs). Herein, an approach is developed for the in situ fabrication of a MOFs&#8208;derived porous carbon material, co&#8208;loaded with Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co&#8208;N x sites and integrated onto Fe&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), named Co NP/SA &#8208;NC/Fe&#8208;NCNTs. Incorporating polymer&#8208;wrapped CNTs improves MOFs dispersion annealing at high temperature, which amplifies the three&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) by generating much more mesopores and exposing additional active sites within the catalysts layer. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the presence of Co NPs promotes the conversion of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates for Co&#8208;N x sites. The optimized catalysts display a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, which significantly outperforms the counterpart single structure, as well as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, the PEMFCs and ZABs derived from Co NP/SA &#8208;NC/Fe&#8208;NCNTs catalyst exhibit power densities of 702 and 192 mW cm &#8722;2 , respectively. This work offers novel insights into the synthesis of the composited bifunctional carbon materials for ZABs and PEMFCs application.</description>

                Methanol (ME) is a liquid hydrogen carrier, ideal for on-site-on-demand H2 generation, avoiding its costly and risky distribution issues, but this "ME-to-H2" electric conversion suffers from high voltage (energy consumption) and competitive oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that a synergistic cofunctional Pt1Pdn/(Ni,Co)(OH)x catalyst with Pt single atoms (Pt1) and Pd nanoclusters (Pdn) anchored on OH-vacancy(VOH)-rich (Ni,Co)(OH)x nanoparticles create synergistic triadic active sites, allowing for methanol-enhanced low-voltage H2 generation. For MOR, OH* is preferentially adsorbed on Pdn and then interacts with the intermediates (such as *CHO or *CHOOH) adsorbed favorably on neighboring Pt1 with the assistance of hydrogen bonding from the surface hydrogen of (Ni,Co)(OH)x. The enhanced selectivity of the *CHOOH pathway, instead of *CO, sustains the MOR activity to a practically high current density. For HER, triadic Pt1, Pdn, and OH-vacancy sites on (Ni,Co)(OH)x create an "acid&#8211;base" microenvironment to facilitate water adsorption and splitting, forming H* species on Pt1 and Pdn, and *OH at the vacancy, to promote efficient H2 evolution from the asymmetric Pt1 and Pdn sites via the Tafel mechanism. The triadic-site synergy opens new avenues for the design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable cofunctional catalysts for "on-site-on-demand" H2 production, here facilitated by liquid methanol.</description>

                Herein, this work elucidates the synthesis of the Pd-MoS2 catalyst for application in methanol-mediated overall water splitting. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) pictures offer an exciting nanostructured shape of the Pd-MoS2, depicting a high surface area. Further, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) pictures confirm the lattice plane (100), lattice spacing (0.26 nm), and hexagonal crystal structure of the Pd-MoS2. Moreover, high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images and related color maps disclose the Mo, S, and Pd elements of the Pd-MoS2. The Pd-MoS2 catalyst exhibits lower overpotentials of 224.6 mV [methanol-mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (MM-HER)] at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 133 mV [methanol-mediated oxygen evolution reaction (MM-OER)] at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Further, the Pd-MoS2 illustrates noteworthy stability for 15.5 h for MM-HER and 18 h for MM-OER by chronopotentiometry test. Excitingly, the Pd-MoS2&#8741;Pd-MoS2 cell reveals a small potential of 1.581 V compared to the MoS2&#8741;MoS2 cell (1.648 V) in methanol-mediated overall water splitting. In addition, the Pd-MoS2&#8741;Pd-MoS2 combination reveals brilliant durability over 18 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

                Hydrogen is gaining attention as a fossil fuel alternative due to its potential to meet global energy demands. Producing hydrogen from water splitting is promising as a clean and sustainable fuel pathway. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial in electrocatalytic water splitting for energy conversion and storage. However, water electrolysis faces challenges in cost, efficiency, and scalability. Alternative transition metal electrocatalysts and emerging 2D materials advance electrolysis research, though transitioning from academia to industry remains challenging. The introduction of 3D&#8208;printing technologies has revolutionized electrode fabrication for HER and OER. This review explores integrating 3D&#8208;printing technologies and surface functionalization with non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and emerging 2D materials. It focuses on surface&#8208;functionalized 3D&#8208;printed electrodes using technologies like selective laser melting, stereolithography, and fused deposition modeling with non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts such as transition metal oxides, hydroxides, and emerging 2D materials like transition metal carbide/nitride (MXenes) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The review highlights the opportunities and challenges in scalable fabrication, long&#8208;term durability, and cost&#8208;efficiency for practical implementation. Future research directions include exploring new materials for 3D printing and alternative electrocatalysts alongside leveraging theoretical and machine&#8208;learning approaches to accelerate the development of competitive materials for water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>A Practical Inverse Design Approach for High-Entropy Catalysts with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5712388/v1</link>

                Abstract The vast compositional space of high-entropy materials offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of powerful catalysts. However, their inverse design remains unfeasible due to the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and high-throughput experimental tools. This study demonstrates a practical inverse design approach that integrates spectroscopic descriptors, generative machine learning, and a robotic experimental platform to synthesize and optimize catalyst composition for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The automated system significantly accelerated catalysts design and experimental validation, reducing the time required for synthesis, characterization and performance testing from approximately 20 hours to only 78 minutes per sample. Following a rapid screen for efficient senary high-entropy catalysts, the spectroscopic generative model further optimized the top-performing candidate, lowering its overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 by an additional 32 mV. Our findings are a testament to the potential of an inverse design approach that incorporates spectroscopic descriptors into generative machine learning to accelerate catalyst discovery. Moreover, this approach is also expected to drive the intelligent design of high-performance complex materials.</description>

                The 90-year-old Hume&#8211;Rothery rule was adapted to design an outstanding bifunctional tetra-metallic alloy electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. Following the radius mismatch principles, Fe (131 pm) and Ni (124 pm) are selectively incorporated at the Pd (139 pm) site of Mo0.30Pd0.70 nanosheets. Analogously, Cu (132 pm) alloys with only Pd, while Ag (145 pm) alloys with both Pd and Mo (154 pm). The face-centered cubic Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12 nanosheets with 10&#8211;12 atomic layers, featuring in-plane compressive strain along the {111} basal plane, show 1/3 (422) reflection from local hexagonal symmetry. The more electronegative Pd attracts electron density from Ni/Fe in Mo0.30Pd0.35Ni0.23Fe0.12, synergistically boosting the mass activities for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to 89 &#177; 5 and 38.6 &#177; 3.1 A g&#8211;1 at &#177;400 mV versus RHE, respectively. Full water electrolysis continues for &#8805;550 h, requiring cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.63 V at 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2, delivering 45 mL h&#8211;1 green H2.</description>

                Abstract The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is characterized by a lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolysis, which facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Charge distribution, which can be modulated by the introduction of a heterostructure, plays a key role in enhancing the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups within urea molecules. Herein, a facile all&#8208;room temperature synthesis of functional heterojunction NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 grown on carbon cloth (CC) is presented, and the as&#8208;prepared electrode served as a catalyst for simultaneous hydrogen evolution and urea oxidation reaction. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) study reveals spontaneous transfer of charge at the heterointerface of NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 , which triggers the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions and facilitates the adsorption of electron donating/electron withdrawing group in urea molecules during the UOR. The NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 // NiCo 2 S 4 /CoMo 2 S 4 electrode pair required only a cell voltage of 1.17 and 1.18 V to deliver a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 respectively in urea electrolysis cell and display very good stability.

                Abstract A bifunctional electrocatalyst is developed, exhibiting high catalytic activity and reversibility for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a regulative Fe d&#8208;orbital engineering strategy. In this strategy, iron phthalocyanine organic molecule (FeOM) crystals are axially coordinated onto multilayer Mo 2 CT x MXene (FeOM&#8208;Mo 2 CT x ), adopting a lying&#8208;down conformation. This hybridization fosters unique electronic guest&#8211;host interactions, with FeOM donating charge to Mo 2 CT x via Fe&#8722;O bonding, leading to symmetry breaking in electronic distribution and modified delocalization of Fe&#8208;3d charge, accompanied by a Fe(II) spin&#8208;state transition. These transformations enhance the adsorption and desorption toward oxygenated intermediates, optimizing the * OOH&#8722; * O transition to boost the reversibility of ORR and OER kinetics. The FeOM&#8208;Mo 2 CT x exhibits a favorable ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.961 V and a minimal OER overpotential of 349 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH. The assembled aqueous zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) achieves a peak power density of 155.3 mW cm &#8722;2 and exceptional charge&#8211;discharge durability over 1500 h, outperforming a conventional (Pt/C + RuO 2 ) system. Overall, the findings underscore the significance of electronic structural engineering of FeOM with Mo 2 CT x , paving the way for innovative air cathodes in the development of rechargeable ZABs with enhanced performance and cost&#8208;effectiveness.</description>

                The Fe&#8211;N4-based Fe single-atom catalyst exhibits high efficiency in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, while Co oxides demonstrate excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In this study, we report an easily synthesized carbon-based catalyst CoFe@CNT that incorporates both Fe single atoms and CoO nanoparticles. This catalyst is derived from a two-dimensional metalloporphyrin-based metal&#8211;organic framework (CoFeMOF) composed of an FeTCPP (5,10,15,20-tetrakis(p-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin iron) building unit coordinated with Co2+ and 4,4&#8242;-bipyridine. CoFe@CNT exhibits superior ORR (half-wave potential = 0.85 V) and OER (overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 = 370 mV) performances and better stability compared to both ZnFe@CNT and Co@CNT (from the respective ZnFeMOF and CoMOF precursors) and commercial Pt/C catalysts. XPS analysis reveals that the presence of both Fe&#8211;N4 single-atom and CoO nanoparticles in CoFe@CNT not only induces electron transfer from Co to Fe but also generates a higher combined content of pyridinic N and Fe&#8211;N4 compared to both ZnFe@CNT and Co@CNT, which enhances the catalytic activity. A Zn&#8211;air battery using CoFe@CNT as the cathode catalyst achieves a high power density (115 mW cm&#8211;2), outperforming the Pt/C catalyst. The design and synthesis of this 2D MOF-derived electrocatalyst offer promising prospects for developing high-density metal&#8211;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Selenium-Doped Nickel&#8211;Cobalt Hybrids on Carbon Paper for the Overall Water-Splitting Electrocatalytic System</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c19869</link>

                Designing and constructing hierarchically structured materials with heterogeneous compositions is the key to developing an effective catalyst for overall water-splitting applications. Herein, we report the fabrication of hollow-structured selenium-doped nickel&#8211;cobalt hybrids on carbon paper as a self-supported electrode (denoted as Se&#8211;Ni|Co/CP, where Ni|Co hybrids consist of nickel&#8211;cobalt alloy-incorporated nickel&#8211;cobalt oxide). The procedure involves direct growth of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) on bimetal-based nickel&#8211;cobalt hydroxide (NiCoOH) electrodeposited on CP, followed by selenous etching and pyrolysis to obtain the final Se&#8211;Ni|Co/CP electrocatalytic system. The optimized Se&#8211;Ni|Co/CP [Se&#8211;Ni1|Co9/CP(0.3)] exhibits remarkable performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), displaying a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at small overpotentials of 105 mV for HER and 235 mV for OER. Furthermore, it allows an alkali electrolyzer to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.51 V. The outstanding catalytic activity of Se&#8211;Ni|Co/CP is ascribed to the high intrinsic activity of the bimetallic catalyst, efficient interfaces, and charge transport facilitated by the heterogeneous component, the hollow structure inherited from the metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF)-derived material providing ample porosity and active sites, and structural robustness achieved through self-supported construction.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Polarization&#8208;Induced Performance Enhancements in BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes will play a crucial role in future clean energy systems, however severe charge recombination and sluggish charge transfer kinetics have hindered their practical adoption. Exploiting ferroelectric polarization&#8208;controlled charge dynamics promises an additional lever that can potentially enable the performance limits of traditional static photoelectrodes to be surpassed. Here one of the most notable ferroelectric polarization&#8208;induced photocurrent enhancements is reported, using a heterostructure of the multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BFO) and the photoactive bismuth vanadate (BVO) in a neutral pH electrolyte. In contrast to previous works, enhancements for both poling directions are reported, of 136% for down&#8208;poled BFO/BVO and 70% for up&#8208;poled BFO/BVO at 1.23 V RHE in comparison to the unpoled sample, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;95% for prolonged oxygen evolution reaction. Extensive PEC and surface analyses complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the improvements are attributed to the modulation of gradients in the BFO band energies, as well as changes in band&#8208;bending and offsets at the interfaces. Given the scalability of the employed sol&#8211;gel synthesis method and the use of environmentally benign materials and PEC conditions, these findings pave the way for multifunctional materials as new&#8208;generation agile and dynamic catalysts and photoelectrode systems.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Active Site for OER Catalysis at Nickel-Vanadium-Phosphide Depends on V Surface Position and Fe in Alkaline</title>

                Enhancing the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by doping Ni-based electrocatalysts with guest metals other than Fe (V in this work) and the stability of the metal site should be assessed independent of Fe traces and in relation to the guest metal activity in solution. We examined OER catalysis and its sustainability at vanadium-doped nickel phosphide (NixPy-V) independent of the role of Fe traces in alkaline. V was included in NixPy by codeposition at cathodic bias (termed Vbulk) or postdeposition during the phosphide-to-hydroxide surface transformation at anodic bias in alkaline spiked with VCl3 (termed Vsurface). Doping with Vsurface strongly promoted OER and reduced the Tafel slope in KOH purified of Fe traces (Fe-free KOH), indicating a Vsurface-path lowering of overpotentials independent of and different from the mechanism via Fe surface sites at NiOxHy. A similar effect was not observed with Vbulk inclusion. Sustaining catalysis via Vsurface-sites required maintaining a sufficiently high activity of V in solution. The prominent role of Vsurface sites and the dependence of stability on solution condition are reminiscent of the behavior of Fe surface sites in NiOxHy. This work points to a trend of behavior of active site dynamics at Ni-based OER catalysts in alkaline and presents a question and insight on how to stabilize the guest-metal site at the solid&#8211;liquid interface.</description>

                Abstract Gold-based (Au) nanostructures are efficient catalysts for CO oxidation, hydrogen evolution (HER), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions, but stabilizing them on graphene (Gr) is challenging due to weak affinity from delocalized $$p_{z}$$ carbon orbitals. This study investigates forming metal alloys to enhance stability and catalytic performance of Au-based nanocatalysts. Using ab initio density functional theory, we characterize $${\text {M}_{(n-x)}\text {Au}_{x}}$$ sub-nanoclusters (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, and Ag) with atomicities $$n=1-4$$ , both in gas-phase and supported on Gr. We find that M atoms act as &#8220;anchors,&#8221; enhancing binding to Gr and modulating catalytic efficiency. Notably, $${\text {Pt}_{(n-x)}\text {Au}_{x}}$$ /Gr shows improved stability, with segregation tendencies mitigated upon adsorption on Gr. The d -band center ( $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ ) model indicates catalytic potential, correlating an optimal $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ range of $$-1 \text { to }-2$$ eV for HER and OER catalysts. Incorporating Au into $${\text{M}_n}$$ adjusts $$\varepsilon _{\text {d}}$$ closer to the Fermi level, especially for Group-10 alloys, offering designs with improved stability and efficiency comparable to pure Au nanocatalysts. Our methodology leveraged SimStack, a workflow framework enabling modeling and analysis, enhancing reproducibility, and accelerating discovery. This work demonstrates SimStack&#8217;s pivotal role in advancing the understanding of composition-dependent stability and catalytic properties of Au-alloy clusters, providing a systematic approach to optimize metal-support interactions in catalytic applications.</description>

                Designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with fast reaction kinetics and high stability is an outstanding challenge in green hydrogen generation through overall water splitting (OWS). Layered double hydroxide (LDH) heterostructure materials are promising candidates to catalyze both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the two OWS half-cell reactions. This work develops a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize hierarchical heterostructure MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH and MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH electrocatalysts, which exhibit extremely good OER and HER performance as witnessed by their low IR-corrected overpotentials of 156 mV and 61 mV with at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 under light assistance. The MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH&#8214;MoS2@NiFeCo-LDH OWS cell achieves a low cell voltage of 1.46V at 10 mA cm-2 during light-assisted water electrolysis. Both materials exhibited exceptional stability under industrially relevant HER and OER conditions, maintaining a current density of 1 A cm-2 with minimal alterations in their potential and performance. The experimental and computational results demonstrate that doping the LDH matrix with high-valence Mo atoms and MoS2 quantum dots improves the electrocatalytic activity by 1) enhancing electron transfer, 2) making the electrocatalyst metallic, 3) increasing the number of active sites, 4) lowering the thermodynamic overpotential, and 5) changing the OER mechanism. Overall, this work develops a facile synthesis method to design highly active and stable MoS2@NiFeCo-Mo(doped)-LDH heterostructure electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract This investigation explores the potential of co&#8208;incorporating nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) into copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures for bifunctional electrochemical charge storage and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). A facile wet chemical synthesis method is employed to co&#8208;incorporate Ni and Co into CuO, yielding diverse nanostructured morphologies, including rods, spheres, and flake. The X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman analyses confirmed the formation of NiCo&#8208;CuO nanostructure, with minor phases of nickel oxide (NiO) and cobalt tetraoxide (Co 3 O 4 ). High&#8208;resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) also confirms the diverse morphologies and the minor phases of oxides. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed higher charge states of Cu, Ni, and Co in the NiCo&#8208;CuO nanostructure, enhancing its charge storage and OER. Site&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure analysis elucidated the spatial distribution of Cu, Ni, and Co in the nanostructure. Furthermore, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy provided insights into the local atomic structures, revealing increased coordination numbers and interatomic distances in the NiCo&#8208;CuO nanostructure. In situ Raman analysis discloses the transformation of Co 3 O 4 into cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH) 2 ) and cobalt oxide (CoO) into cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) The NiCo&#8208;CuO nanostructures exhibited superior specific capacitance, favorable Tafel behavior, and low overpotential positioning as promising bifunctional materials for energy storage and conversion applications. This work contributes to the development of efficient CuO nanocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient, multifunctional electrodes for energy storage and conversion devices is crucial. Herein, lattice strains are reported in the &#946;&#8208;phase polymorph of CoMoO 4 within CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 heterostructure via phosphorus doping (P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ) and used as a high&#8208;performance trifunctional electrode for supercapacitors (SCs), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. A tensile strain of +2.42% on the &#946;&#8208;phase of CoMoO 4 in P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 results in superior electrochemical performance compared to CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 . The optimized P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 achieves a high energy density of 118 Wh kg &#8722;1 in an asymmetric supercapacitor and low overpotentials of 189 mV for the HER and 365 mV for the OER at a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 . This results in a low overall water splitting voltage of 1.71 V at the same current density making it an effective bifunctional electrode in a 1 m KOH freshwater electrolyte. Theoretical analysis shows that the excellent performance of P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 can be attributed to interfacial interactions between CoMoO 4 and Co 3 O 4 , and the &#946;&#8208;phase of CoMoO 4 , which lead to strong OH &#8722; adsorption and low energy barriers for reaction intermediates. Practical application is demonstrated by using P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 &#8208;based ASCs to self&#8208;generate hydrogen (H 2 ) in a P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 ||P&#8208;CoMoO 4 @Co 3 O 4 alkaline seawater electrolyzer, showcasing its potential for future energy technologies.</description>

                Abstract The study introduces flexible and scalable manufacturing approach for electrodes utilizing boron&#8208;doped silicon as conductive support for iridium nanoparticles, addressing the challenges of cost and scarcity associated wit noble catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Colloidal Ir nanoparticles are synthesized via pulsed&#8208;laser ablation (&#8776;4&#8211;7 nm) and decorated on B&#8208;doped Si (&#8776;100 nm) through electrostatic adsorption. Titanium substrates are ultrasonically sprayed with Si:B &#8211; Ir and Ir nanoparticles with very low iridium loading of 12 wt.%. Crystalline Ir phases (Ir(111), Ir(200)) are observed and known to enhance the OER mechanism. Additionally, atom probe tomography confirms that the Si support particles contained 0.03&#8208;0.5 at% of boron throughout the entire particle, while electrical permittivity and through&#8208;plane measurements reveal a positive impact of B&#8208;doped Si on the electrical conductivity of the nanocatalysts and of the ultralow&#8208;loaded catalyst coated Ti substrates (0.12 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 ), respectively. Rotating disk electrode results show pronounced oxidation peaks for decorated Ir nanoparticles. The Si:B&#8208;Ir 4 nm catalyst exhibits the highest turonover frequency (2.62 s&#8315;&#185;) and a competitive electrochemical surface area (25 m 2 g Ir &#8722;1 ) compared to Si:B&#8208;Ir 7 nm (0.96 s&#8315;&#185;; 37.5 m 2 g Ir &#8722;1 ) and Ir black (0.24 s&#8315;&#185;; 5 m 2 g Ir &#8722;1 ). The overall analysis of the parameters highlights a performant catalytic efficiency, through balancing activity and reaction kinetics effectively.</description>

                ii regions closest to the centre of the MW (at a radii of 4-5 kpc) are close to the binned oxygen abundances in NGC 3521 at the same galactocentric distances; an accurate value of the central oxygen abundance in the MW cannot be established because of the lack of the measurements near the centre. The oxygen abundances in the outer part of the MW are lower than those in the outer part of NGC 3521. The gas mass fraction in the outer part of the MW is higher than in NGC 3521. The obtained values of the effective oxygen yield, Y_eff, in NGC 3521 are close to the empirical estimation of the oxygen yield, Y_O. This suggests that mass exchange with the surroundings plays little to no role in the current chemical evolution of NGC3521. The values of the Y_eff in the MW were determined using two variants of the radial distribution of the gas mass surface density. The values of the Y_eff in the MW obtained with the first distribution are also close to Y_O, as in NGC 3521. The Y_eff in the MW obtained with the second distribution are below Y_O at radii between &#8764;6 and &#8764;10.4 kpc. This suggests that the mass exchange with the surroundings can play a significant role in the chemical evolution of this part of the MW, in contrast to that in NGC 3521. To draw a solid conclusion about the role of mass exchange with the surroundings in the chemical evolution of the MW it is essential to determine which of these distributions provides a more adequate description of the gas distribution in the MW.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Origins for Superconductivity in Strain-Engineered
  La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>

                The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</description>

                We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. Such interaction alters the cluster&#8217;s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolve and give oxidative reactants.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics between multiple competitors reduce phytoplankton coexistence but have limited impacts on community productivity</title>

                ABSTRACT Species can evolve rapidly in response to competition but how evolution within communities affects community properties is unclear. To test this, we grew three marine phytoplankton species in monoculture (alone) or polyculture (together) for 17 weeks. We then combined them in communities based on their competition history (monoculture or polyculture isolates) and tracked their composition and productivity over time. We found that species dominance was unaffected, but coexistence was reduced when species evolved together (polyculture isolates). Total biovolume was robust to changes in species relative abundances. However, polyculture isolates had greater oxygen fluxes during exponential phase and were less robust to the addition of an invader. Our results suggest that evolution within communities can strengthen competitive differences between species with uneven effects on different aspects of community functioning. Thus, we should be cautious in extrapolating the consequences of evolution on community biomass to other aspects of productivity or stability.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Vacancy-Mediated Microflower-like Bi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;I for Reactive Oxygen Species Generation through Piezo-Photocoupling Effect</title>

                Photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) evolution with Bi5O7I still suffers from sluggish charge carrier dynamics and limited light absorption. Herein, abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) were introduced into the microflower-like Bi5O7I, and its ROS generation toward organic dye degradation under the synergistic effect of visible light and ultrasound irradiation was investigated. Benefiting from the broadened visible-light absorption range, stronger piezoresponse, and higher carrier transport efficiency in OV-enriched Bi5O7I (2-PEG-Bi5O7I), both its photocatalytic and piezocatalytic degradations were improved. More importantly, its piezo-photocatalytic degradation performance was greater than the sum of the corresponding photocatalysis and piezocatalysis, indicating a strong coupling effect. In addition, the piezo-photocatalytic yield of &#8226;O2&#8211; with 2-PEG-Bi5O7I was 1.5 times higher than that with Bi5O7I, and it was also 4.3 and 3.1 times higher than its single photocatalysis and piezocatalysis, respectively. Interestingly, no noticeable &#8226;OH was detected in the case of visible-light irradiation, while the piezocatalytic and piezo-photocatalytic yields of &#8226;OH were 3.6 and 5.3 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, respectively, with OV-enriched Bi5O7I, surpassing the pristine Bi5O7I as well. This work advances the coupling effect between photocatalysis and piezocatalysis as a new strategy for efficient ROS generation and also discloses the positive role of oxygen vacancies in improving multiresponsive catalysis.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) electrosynthesis via the 2e &#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H 2 O 2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B 4 C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e &#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B 4 C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e &#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B 4 C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150 mA cm &#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O 2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Hydrothermal Fluids Inferred from the Occurrence and Isotope Characteristics of the Carbonate Minerals at the Pogo Gold Deposit, Alaska, USA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min15010067</link>

                Pogo is identified as a deep-seated, intrusion-related gold deposit. Carbonate minerals have a close spatial relationship to hydrothermal gold mineralization in all of its principal ore zones. The carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of carbonate minerals (siderite, ankerite, and calcite) present within the deposit illustrate the isotopic evolution of the ore-forming fluid. The initial hydrothermal fluid phase is interpreted to be magmatic in origin. The fluid evolution was characterized by a gradual decrease in &#948;18O and a slight increase in &#948;13C with decreasing temperature. The dominant carbon-bearing species was CO2, with methane introduced sporadically. Siderite is associated with early-stage mineralization and occurs with ankerite in main-stage ore assemblages. Calcite is recognized in the later stages of mineralization. Gold in the Pogo deposit occurs as native gold, Au-Bi-Te minerals, inclusions in sulfide minerals, or as &#8220;invisible gold&#8221;. The latter is found in pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz, based on ion microprobe analysis. The presence of invisible gold in these minerals has significant metallurgical implications for gold processing at the Pogo mine.</description>

      <title>Fermi Level Equilibration and Charge Transfer at the Exsolved Metal-Oxide Interface</title>

                Exsolution is a promising approach for fabricating oxide-supported metal nanocatalysts through redox-driven metal precipitation. A defining feature of exsolved nanocatalysts is their anchored metal-oxide interface, which exhibits exceptional structural stability in (electro)catalysis. However, the electronic interactions at this unique interface remain unclear, despite their known impact on catalytic performance. In this study, we confirm charge transfer between the host oxide and the exsolved metal by demonstrating a two-stage Fermi level (EF) evolution on SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3&#8722;&#948; (STF) during metallic iron (Fe0) exsolution. Combining ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with theoretical analysis, we show that EF initially rises due to electron doping from oxygen vacancy formation in STF. Subsequently, upon Fe0 precipitation, EF stabilizes and becomes insensitive to further oxygen release in STF, driven by EF equilibration and charge transfer between STF and the exsolved Fe0. These findings highlight the importance of considering electronic metal&#8211;support interactions when optimizing exsolved nanocatalysts.</description>

                The present study focuses on electrical stimulation for composting. Using the PSALSAR method, a systematic review resulted in 24 relevant articles. For each system, the review describes key materials, composter design, operating conditions, temperature evolution, compost maturity, microbial community, and outcome. The examined studies fall into four main systems: electric field-assisted aerobic composting (EAAC), electrolytic oxygen aerobic composting (EOAC), microbial fuel cells (MFC), and thermoelectric generators (TEG). Apart from the main systems highlighted above, there is a rare case, which remains hardly studied. This includes bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting (AnCBE, III). EAAC and EOAC systems biologically balance microbial activity and organic matter decomposition, whereas MFC and TEG systems have dual functioning due to energy generated alongside waste degradation. These innovative systems significantly improve composting efficiency by speeding up organic matter breakdown, increasing oxygen supply, and facilitating energy recovery. Together, they overcome the drawbacks of conventional composting systems and promote more environmentally friendly waste management solutions.</description>

      <title>Hydrogeochemical Evolution, Isotopic Insights, and Genetic Models of Geothermal Water in Anhui Province, China</title>

                Anhui Province is rich in geothermal water resources, making the study of its hydrochemical evolution and genetic models essential for scientific development and sustainable utilization. This study combines hydrochemical and hydrogen&#8211;oxygen isotopic data from different regions of Anhui Province to analyze the hydrogeochemical evolution characteristics and recharge mechanisms of basin-type and mountainous-type geothermal waters. The results show that basin-type geothermal water is predominantly of the Cl&#8211;Na type, with water&#8211;rock interactions mainly including halite dissolution, gypsum dissolution, dedolomitization, and silicate hydrolysis. The groundwater system is relatively closed off, with slow flow rates. In contrast, mountainous geothermal water is mainly of the HCO3&#8211;Na&#183;Ca, SO4&#8211;Na&#183;Ca, and SO4&#8211;Na types, with water&#8211;rock interactions primarily involving calcite dissolution, dolomite dissolution, and gypsum dissolution. Enhanced precipitation infiltration due to fault structures leads to stronger recharge and an open-system characteristic. The genetic models of the two types of geothermal water reveal the structural and recharge mechanisms of thermal reservoirs under different geological settings, highlighting the significant control of geological background on geothermal water formation.</description>

                Modern-day applications demand onboard electricity generation that can be achieved using piezoelectric phenomena. Reducing the dimensionality of materials is a pathway to enhancing the piezoelectric properties. Transition-metal dichalcogenides have been shown to exhibit high piezoelectricity. Monolayer MoS2 possesses strong piezoelectricity that is otherwise negligible in its bulk form. The presence of sulfur vacancy defects in two-dimensional MoS2 can starkly reduce piezoelectric output due to enhanced charge screening. Oxygen passivation offers thermodynamically favorable and superior vacancy passivation. Here, we demonstrate an in situ oxygen passivation of sulfur vacancies achieved by performing chemical vapor deposition in atmospheric pressure conditions, resulting in a dramatically enhanced piezoelectric output. We achieved an out-of-plane effective piezoelectric coefficient d33eff 0.54 pm/V for the MoS2 monolayer with sulfur vacancies (SV-MoS2) and 0.94 pm/V where sulfur vacancies are passivated by oxygen (OP-MoS2). The piezoelectric device (PED) based on OP-MoS2 exhibits 26% higher output voltage than SV-MoS2 with the maximum peak-to-peak value of 0.95 V. Additionally, we show that the OP-MoS2-based PED can charge a 330 nF capacitor 30% faster than the SV-MoS2 PED for up to 50 mV in 0.5 s by repetitive finger tapping. The evolution of piezoelectricity in MoS2 with sulfur vacancy defect manipulation promises an avenue for scalable defect engineering for next-generation applications in miniaturized self-powered electronics and sensors across computing, healthcare, and size-, weight-, and power-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Groundwater Recharge Evaluation Using Stable Isotopes and the NETPATH Model in Al-Madinah Al-Munawarah Province, Saudi Arabia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w17020211</link>

                In this study, hydrogeochemistry and environmentally stable isotopes were employed to examine the processes involved in recharging aquifer systems and the changes in the groundwater chemistry caused by the interaction between the water and the aquifer matrix. Based on data derived from 113 groundwater wells, various tools and techniques, including stable environmental isotopes Oxygen-18 and Deuterium (&#948;18O and &#948;D) for 33 samples and geochemical modeling with NETPATH, were used to evaluate the recharge mechanism and the evolution of the groundwater, combining GIS with hydrological and hydrochemical methods. The results revealed that groundwater from the Quaternary was the main source for irrigation; the water quality was categorized as relatively fresh to saline, with the total dissolved solids (TDSs) ranging from 261.3 to 8628.56 mg/L, exhibiting an average value of 2311.68 mg/L. The results of the environmental isotope analysis showed that the range of oxygen &#948;18O isotopes in the groundwater was from &#8722;5.65&#8240; to +0.39&#8240;, while the range of hydrogen &#948;D isotopes was from &#8722;32.60&#8240; to 4.73&#8240;. Moreover, the &#948;18O&#8211;&#948;D relationship indicated that the groundwater samples fell around the global meteoric precipitation line, showing a strong relationship, with a coefficient (R2) of approximately 0.82. The NETPATH model revealed that the dissolved chemical species within the groundwater system primarily originated from processes such as mineral weathering and dissolution, ion exchange, and evaporation.</description>

                The aim of this study is to demonstrate the enhanced efficiency of combined therapeutic strategies for the treatment of growing tumors, based on computational experiments of a continuous-level modeling framework. In particular, the tumor growth is simulated within a host tissue and treated as a multiphase fluid, with each cellular species considered as a distinct fluid phase. Our model integrates the impact of chemical species on tumor dynamics, and we model &#8211;through reaction-diffusion equations&#8211; the spatio-temporal evolution of oxygen, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and chemotherapeutic agents. Simulations of a growing tumor exposed to external radiation showcase the rapid impact of radiotherapy on tumor suppression, however this effect diminishes over time. To enhance the therapeutic efficiency of radiotherapy, we investigate the combination of external radiation with the anti-VEGF drug bevacizumab and the cytotoxic drug docetaxel. Our simulations demonstrate that this synergistic approach integrates the immediate effectiveness of radiation therapy with the enduring tumor-suppressive capabilities of chemotherapy.</description>

                Abstract. The study of isotopic ratios of atmospheric oxygen in fossilized air trapped in ice core bubbles provides information on variations in the hydrological cycle at low latitudes and productivity in the past. However, to refine these interpretations, it is necessary to better quantify fractionation of oxygen in the biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. We set up a system of closed biological chambers in which we studied the evolution of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 due to biological processes. To easily replicate experiments, we developed a multiplexing system which we describe here. We compared measurements of elemental and isotopic composition of O2 using two different measurement techniques: optical spectrometry (Optical-Feedback Cavity- Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy, i.e. OF-CEAS technique), which enables higher temporal resolution and continuous data collection and isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with a flanged air recovery system, thus validating the data analysis conducted through the OF-CEAS technique. As a first application, we investigated isotopic discrimination during respiration and photosynthesis. We conducted a 5-day experiment using maize (Zea mays L.) as model species. The 18O discrimination value for maize during dark plant respiration was determined as - 17.8 &#177; 0.9 &#8240; by IRMS and - 16.1 &#177; 1.1 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. We also found a value attributed to the isotopic discrimination of terrestrial photosynthesis equal to + 3.2 &#177; 2.6 &#8240; by IRMS and + 6.7 &#177; 3.8 &#8240; by optical spectrometer. These findings were consistent with a previous study by Paul et al. (2023).</description>

                In a hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis system, H2 evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are coupled with microorganisms to achieve the highly efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals using H2 as an electron mediator. However, currently developed HER electrocatalysts suffer from poor biocompatibility, hindering the performance of the system. This study presents a N- and Si-doped polythiophene nanocomposite (PTh-NSi) as a nonmetal HER electrocatalyst with biocompatibility for use in a hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis system. By coupling PTh-NSi with Ralstonia eutropha H16, conversion of CO2 to poly-&#946;-hydroxybutyrate with a maximum yield of 662.99 &#177; 27.46 mg/L was achieved. The PTh-NSi electrocatalyst demonstrated HER performance in bacterial media, minimal reactive oxygen species production, and no heavy metal ion leaching, ensuring biocompatibility with R. eutropha H16. The interactions between PTh-NSi and R. eutropha H16 were revealed. This work highlights an approach to designing biocompatible catalysts for hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis systems, offering the potential for sustainable CO2 conversion.</description>

                The presence of trace CO impurity gas in hydrogen fuel can rapidly deactivate platinum&#8208;based hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) catalysts due to poisoning effects, yet the precise CO tolerance mechanism remains debated. Our designed Au@PtX bifunctional core&#8208;shell nanocatalysts exhibit excellent performance of CO tolerance in acidic solution during HOR and possess exceptional Raman spectroscopy enhancement. Through capturing and analyzing in situ Raman spectroscopy evidences on *OH, metal&#8208;O species and *CO evolution under 0.3 V, we confirm that oxygen&#8208;containing species on PtRu and PtSn catalysts promote the oxidation and desorption of *CO. While Ru enhances *CO adsorption on Pt, the primary CO tolerance performance of PtRu arises from *CO oxidation via a bifunctional pathway. Additionally, electronic structure of Sn reduces *CO adsorption on Pt sites, complementing the bifunctional mechanism to further enhance the CO tolerance performance of PtSn. These discoveries significantly deepen our understanding of the anti&#8208;poisoning mechanism of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the HOR process and offer valuable insights for rational catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Therapy Combined With Platelet-Rich Plasma for the Treatment of Avascular Necrosis of the Talus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.77578</link>
      <description>Rui A. Sousa, Jaime Babulal, Paulo Vin&#237;cius Amado, Cureus. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406532460

                Avascular necrosis (AVN) is characterized by compromised blood supply to bone tissue, often resulting in significant pain and functional impairment. Conservative treatment options for early-stage AVN of the talus are scarce, with non-weight-bearing protocols and hyperbaric oxygen therapy showing limited efficacy. This report presents a potential novel approach to managing non-traumatic AVN of the talus using a combination of adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). A 60-year-old male presented with progressive right ankle pain of a two-year evolution. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed stage II AVN of the talus with extensive bone infarctions occupying almost all of its volume but with no collapse. A single injection of SVF and PRP was performed after diagnostic arthroscopy, followed by a tailored rehabilitation protocol. The patient experienced significant pain relief, with no further need for analgesics, and was able to return to non-impact sports. At the 18-month follow-up, functional scores showed significant improvement, and MRI showed stable AVN with no evidence of collapse. This report highlights SVF and PRP as a potential effective conservative option for non-traumatic talar AVN.</description>

      <title>A multilamellar organelle for chemosymbiosis in an aplacophoran mollusc adapted to anoxic cold seep sediment</title>

                Symbiosis with chemoautotrophic bacteria has evolved in many animal lineages inhabiting reducing habitats such as hydrothermal vents, allowing these holobionts to thrive in dark biospheres. In certain instances, the symbionts have become intracellular, residing within specialised bacteriocytes. The integration of microbial symbionts with eukaryotic cells vary across known animals; however, no specialised organelle dedicated to chemosynthesis has been identified yet. Here, we report a mode of symbiosis where sulphur-oxidising bacteria cultured within spherical multilamellar compartments (~12 &#956;m) in the cold-seep aplacophoran mollusc Chaetoderma shenloong. This organelle, which we name 'dracosphera', is ubiquitous within the hypertrophied and intricately reticulate digestive gland of C. shenloong, which has otherwise lost most of its gut. Given that the symbionts are strictly anaerobic and the host resides in anoxic sediments tens of centimetres below the surface, the dracosphera may serve to minimise oxygen diffusion to the bacteria, akin to mechanisms observed in microbial diazotrophs or termite hindguts, as supported by our genomic and spatial transcriptomic analyses. Hypoxic conditions have been known to induce radical adaptations in meiofauna, exemplified by the acquisition of hydrogenosomes. Our discovery of similarly exceptional adaptations in C. shenloong provides new insights into the evolution of such organelles also in larger animals.</description>

                Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is considered to be one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) under alkaline conditions due to its flexible structure, wide composition and abundant 3D electrons. However, its slow electrochemical reaction rate, high affinity for the reaction intermediate *COOH, easy exposure to low exponential crystal faces and limited metal active sites that seriously hinder the further improvement of UOR activities. Herein it is reported electrocatalyst composed of rich oxygen-vacancy (Ov) defects with amorphous SeOx-covered Ni(OH)2 (Ov-SeOx/Ni(OH)2). Surprisingly, at 100 mA cm-2, compared with Ni(OH)2 (1.46 V (vs RHE)), Ov-SeOx/Ni(OH)2 has a potential of 1.35 V. Meanwhile, Ov-SeOx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst also showed good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, so it is used as the electrolytic cell assembled by UOR and HER bifunctional catalysts and only 1.57 V could reach 100 mA cm-2. Density functional theory (DFT) study revealed that introduce of amorphous SeOx optimizes the electronic structure of the central active metal, amorphous/crystalline interfaces promote charge-carrier transfer, shift d-band center and entail numerous spin-polarized electrons during the reaction, which speeds up the UOR reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Physiological and Molecular Mechanism of Insect Herbivory Tolerance in Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003543237-18</link>
      <description>Kaushik Pramanik, Amit Layek, Durga Mahalanobish, Debashis Roy, Debjyoti Majumder, CRC Press eBooks. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406417657

                The primary focus in plant resistance against insect herbivory has been on antibiosis and antixenosis, causing adverse effects in the morpho-physiology of herbivores. These mechanisms can induce selection pressures on herbivores, leading to the development of pest resistance. In contrast, tolerance presents a more sustainable pest management approach as it relies solely on a plant's response, avoiding the evolution of resistance in pest populations. The unique aspect of tolerance lies in the plant's ability to accommodate many herbivores without negatively impacting the insects' physiology or behavior. Despite its appealing characteristics, tolerance has been insufficiently studied and understood. This chapter explores the tolerance strategies employed by plants in response to insect herbivory, with a specific focus on molecular and physiological approaches to enhance insect resistance. When faced with insect attacks, plants employ various defense mechanisms, including the perception of insect effectors and the activation of signaling components such as reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ ions. The regulation of defense signaling involves physical barriers, secondary metabolites, phytohormones, volatile compounds, and several defense proteins. This chapter also includes the biological and socio-economic factors that have limited the integration of tolerance into plant resistance and integrated pest management. The ongoing expansion of molecular techniques for understanding plant&#8211;insect interactions is deemed crucial for future efforts in developing innovative plant varieties resistant to insects.</description>

      <title>NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a Key Component in Developing Enhanced Performance Electrolytes for All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>

                ABSTRACT Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are attractive electrochemical systems for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite the most developed ones being those based on vanadium, the search for new chemistries is essential to overcome several problems associated with this metal identified as a critical raw material. All&#8208;iron redox flow battery (A&#8208;IRFB) is an interesting device due to iron abundance and worldwide distribution. However, the poor performance of its negative half&#8208;cell, due to the sluggish plating/stripping processes related to the Fe 2+ /Fe 0 redox pair, negatively impacts its energy efficiency and long&#8208;term performance. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of a low concentration of NaHSO 3 (10 mM), as a novel additive, to an electrolyte formulation based on 0.5 M FeCl 2 , 3 M NaCl, and 10 mM citric acid (H 3 Cit) remarkably improves the electrochemical behavior of the negative half&#8208;cell. The enhanced performance can be explained as the additive guarantees a low oxygen solution content (reductant agent), promotes the plating/stripping reactions (improving the kinetics of the Fe 0 deposit through the formation of a FeHSO 3 + complex), and diminishes the contribution of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The use of this key additive opens up a promising scenario for the development of A&#8208;IRFBs with significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, thus boosting their potential commercial development.</description>

      <title>The systemic evolutionary theory of the origin of cancer (SETOC): an update</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-025-01069-w</link>
      <description>Antonio Mazzocca, Giovanni Ferraro, Giovanni Misciagna, Molecular Medicine. 31(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406346950

                Abstract The Systemic Evolutionary Theory of the Origin of Cancer (SETOC) is a recently proposed theory founded on two primary principles: the cooperative and endosymbiotic process of cell evolution as described by Lynn Margulis, and the integration of complex systems operating in eukaryotic cells, which is a core concept in systems biology. The SETOC proposes that malignant transformation occurs when cells undergo a continuous adaptation process in response to long-term injuries, leading to tissue remodeling, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cancer. This process involves a maladaptive response, wherein the 'endosymbiotic contract&#8217; between the nuclear-cytoplasmic system (derived from the primordial archaeal cell) and the mitochondrial system (derived from the primordial &#945;-proteobacterium) gradually breaks down. This ultimately leads to uncoordinated behaviors and functions in transformed cells. The decoupling of the two cellular subsystems causes transformed cells to acquire phenotypic characteristics analogous to those of unicellular organisms, as well as certain biological features of embryonic development that are normally suppressed. These adaptive changes enable cancer cells to survive in the harsh tumor microenvironment characterized by low oxygen concentrations, inadequate nutrients, increased catabolic waste, and increased acidity. De-endosymbiosis reprograms the sequential metabolic functions of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This leads to increased lactate fermentation (Warburg effect), respiratory chain dysfunction, and TCA cycle reversal. Here, we present an updated version of the SETOC that incorporates the fundamental principles outlined by this theory and integrates the epistemological approach used to develop it.</description>

      <title>Oxidative Stress in Children and Adolescents: Insights Into Human Biology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.24200</link>
      <description>A. E. Samsonov, Samuel S. Urlacher, American Journal of Human Biology. 37(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406476989

                ABSTRACT Oxidative stress (OS) is a key biological challenge and selective pressure for organisms with aerobic metabolism. The result of the imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defense, OS can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and plays an important role in driving variation in biological aging and health. Among humans, OS research has focused overwhelmingly on adults, with demonstrated connections between OS, inflammation, and metabolic and neurodegenerative conditions. Relatively little attention has been given to OS during childhood and adolescence. This lack of early life OS research exists despite clear implications for informing human life history evolution, subadult development, and lifelong health. Here, we review current knowledge on OS during human subadulthood. Our objectives are threefold: (1) To highlight common methods for measuring OS among children and adolescents and to establish typical measurement values; (2) To summarize the evidence linking demographic and ecological factors to variation in subadult OS; (3) To identify avenues for future OS research in human biology. Our review underscores an expanding methodological toolkit for assessing OS among children and adolescents. Subadult OS is considerably elevated compared to OS among adults, a pattern eliciting unknown consequences and likely related to increased early life metabolic demands (e.g., unique human brain development). Factors such as diet, physical activity, infectious disease, and structural neglect also appear to drive subadult OS. Current limitations for research on subadult OS are evident. Future work should emphasize evolutionary, biocultural, and energetic life course perspectives to advance this promising area of human biology.</description>

                Abstract We present an investigation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6 (220.7&#8722;274.9 GHz). We identified about 3700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of the COMs detected, using the iterative LTE line-fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH 3 CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH 2 OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH 2 OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a solar system comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COM abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in the Synthetic Utility of ortho-Quinone Methides for Cyclization Reactions: A Versatile Skeleton</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2174/0113852728356759241129064208</link>
      <description>Qinggao Hou, Xianping Liu, Liyong Chen, Ruzhen Cao, S. Y. Yue, Longzhi Zhu, Biquan Xiong, Current Organic Chemistry. 29(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406400890

                In the past decade, the field of ortho-quinone methides (o-QMs) has witnessed remarkable advancements, underscoring their pivotal role as synthetic intermediates in organic chemistry. These electrically neutral species, distinguished by a cyclohexadiene moiety conjugated with a carbonyl and an exo-methylene group, possess an aromatic zwitterionic resonance structure. This unique framework endows them with a pronounced electrophilicity, particularly at the 1,4-positions. The rich chemistry of o-QMs encompasses three principal reaction modalities: 1,4-conjugated addition, [4 + X] cycloaddition (X = 1, 2, 3, etc.), and oxa-6&#960;- electrocyclization pathways. Specifically, the synthesis of chromane derivatives is achieved through [4 + 2] cycloaddition and subsequent oxa-6&#960;-electrocyclization, whereas benzofuran derivatives are accessed via the [4 + 1] cycloaddition route. This review provides a systematic summary of the latest advancements in cycloaddition reactions involving ortho-quinone methides and their derivatives. It offers an in-depth analysis of the substrate diversity and potential reaction mechanisms underlying these transformations. The cycloaddition reactions presented herein are uniformly characterized as ionic systems, with the tautomerization between the oxygen anion generated subsequent to the deprotonation of o-QMs and the resulting carbonyl group identified as a pivotal step for reaction activation. Moreover, we have expanded on the discussion to include a detailed examination of drug intermediate compounds derived from o-QMs. These skeletal derivatives are highlighted for their growing utility in the realm of drug design and synthesis, effectively bridging the divide between foundational research and pharmaceutical applications. We aspire to stimulate the evolution and innovation of synthetic methodologies that leverage o-QMs as scaffolds. By in-depth investigation of the o-QMs-mediated cyclization reactions, we aim to offer theoretical insights that will guide the synthesis of intricate (chiral) cyclic compounds, thereby enhancing the practical application of o-QMs in both chemical research and medical development.</description>

                T Coron&#230; Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova with an 80-year recurrence interval whose next eruption is imminent. We aim to resolve the accretion mechanism of the binary system governing the mass transfer during its super-active phase. Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we analyzed the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity. We performed Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the system's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find evidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the super-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The accretion disk is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its maximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation energies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright spot at the stream impact on the accretion disk outer radius, the irradiation at the red-giant facing side, the stream-disk overflow, the accretion disk wind, and an expanding nebula. The nebula emerged at the rise of the super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years. The temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure from quiescence started in the disk, likely triggered by a disk instability similar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass accretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further enhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase. Symbiotic recurrent nova, such as T CrB, are governed by similar mass-transfer mechanisms as found in cataclysmic variables despite their different orbital properties (longer orbital periods imposing larger accretion disks) and evolutionary pathways.</description>

N&#248;rskov Festschrift".I received a PhD in physics from &#197;rhus University, Denmark, under the inspiring supervision of Bengt Lundqvist. After postdoc experiences at &#197;rhus University, IBM Yorktown Heights Research Laboratories, and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, I found it hard to find a faculty position in Denmark in the early 1980s. There simply were no openings. Fortunately, I was offered a position at the Haldor Tops&#248;e Research Laboratories&#9472;strongly supported by Haldor Tops&#248;e, Henrik Tops&#248;e, and Bjerne Clausen. The involvement with the Tops&#248;e company, one of the world's largest suppliers of catalysts and technology for the chemical and energy industry, influenced my career in many ways. Most importantly, it became clear to me that a theory of heterogeneous catalysis was essential to further advance this important area of science and technology. I kept that focus when starting an academic career, and kept the association with the Tops&#248;e company, now serving on its Board of Directors.In the late 80s the Danish government started to realize that they were about to lose a whole generation of scientists and instituted some special professorships with applicants competing in all fields and at all universities in the country. That got me started at the Technical University of Denmark building up a research group with the funding that came with the professorship. The focus was on understanding surface reactivity as well as impurities in bulk metals.The impurity work started an extremely fruitful collaboration with Flemming Besenbacher at &#197;rhus University that continued for the next decades. With Besenbacher, I founded the Center for Atomic- scale Materials Physics with large-scale funding from the first round of grants from the Danish National Research Foundation. Here my group established the beginning of an understanding of the surface chemical bond. It started with simple models like the effective medium theory. Later, as more accurate density functional calculations became possible, it formed the foundation of the d-band model, or Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov model, of chemisorption. The model allowed an understanding of trends in bond energies of adsorbates on transition metal surfaces including variations from metal to metal, the effect of alloying, the effect of structure and defects, and the effect of strain. The interplay with the experimental groups of Flemming Besenbacher, Ib Chorkendorff and Anders Nilsson became extremely important in supporting the theory efforts.Combining DFT calculations of trends in adsorption energies and transition state energies of elemental surface processes with microkinetic modeling opened the possibility of calculating trends in full catalytic rates, for the first time. This also opened the possibility of making predictions for new catalysts, several of which were synthesized and tested in the groups of Claus Hviid Christensen and of Ib Chorkendorff.I established a Center for Atomic-scale Materials Design with Karsten Jacobsen, Kristian Thygesen, Thomas Bligaard, and Jan Rossmeisl in the late 2000s with funding from the Lundbeck Foundation. An important new effort was aimed at an understanding electrocatalysis. The theory of electrocatalysis was not nearly as developed as the theory of heterogeneous catalysis in terms of a quantitative description of processes and trends in reactivity. One aspect that makes the theoretical description of adsorption and reaction processes at the solid&#8211;liquid interface extremely demanding is the description of the solvated reactants. We developed the so-called computational hydrogen electrode, which opened up for a description of thermo-chemical trends in electrocatalysis. Our first application provided an understanding of trends in reactivity of different catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) providing insights into why Pt is the best elemental electrocatalyst for the cathode process in fuel cells, and how it can be made even better by alloying.The discovery of scaling relations between adsorption energies of different intermediates and between transition energies and adsorption energies opened the possibility of reducing the enormous complexity associated with the calculation of trends for full catalytic rates. We found that many adsorption energies of CHx species scaled and it took us some time to understand the physical basis for this amazing effect well enough to publish the result. Later, we found that this is extremely general. The fact that many activation energies scale with reaction energies, known as Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi relations, have been realized for many years. The scaling we discovered of adsorbed species is considerably more general than that. First, it includes scaling between adsorption energies of intermediates, and therefore transition state energies not only scale with reaction energies but with any chosen representative adsorption energy. This gives an enormous simplification.Moving to Stanford and SLAC in 2010, DOE funding to a new Catalysis center, SUNCAT, allowed a large expansion of the theory efforts, and Thomas Bligaard, Frank Abild Petersen, Felix Studt, and Alexandra Vojvodic moved along to SLAC to form the core theory group in this center. The Center also included a number of outstanding experimentalists, in particular Anders Nilsson, Tom Jaramillo, Matteo Cargnello, Stacey Bent, and Zhenan Bao.A systematic theory of transition metal catalysis was developed in those years. We showed that the scaling relations are extremely general for many surfaces and reactions, and eventually you can plot the rate as a function of a few adsorption energies, or descriptors, for any reaction in a volcano plot directly identifying the optimum catalyst. Sabatier had postulated such a relationship between a bond energy and the rate many years before. The scaling relations directly showed that a single or a few bond energies can in fact be used as a descriptor, it defined what the descriptor should be, and most importantly, it made volcano relations quantitative, allowing its use to search for new catalysts. Many reactions were analyzed including hydrogenation reactions and methane activation reactions.Another development that accelerated considerably during the time at Stanford was the description of electrochemical processes for energy conversion, including models of activation energies in electrocatalysis. This included the oxygen evolution reaction, the CO and CO2 reduction reactions and the N2 reduction reaction. For the latter we developed an understanding of the requirements for a high ammonia selectivity, something that laid the foundation for the thinking in the experimental groups we worked with (Ib Chorkendorff at DTU and Tom Jaramillo and Matteo Cargnello at Stanford).In 2018 I moved back to DTU in a Villum Kann Rasmussen Chair and with good funding from the Villum Foundation. I also took on the position as Chair of the Danish National Research Foundation. The work on electrochemical ammonia synthesis became a cornerstone. Additional work on thermal ammonia synthesis resulted in the discovery of a new promotion mechanism. Surfaces with a spin moment bind adsorbates weaker than the non spin polarized surface of the same metal, and certain adsorbates quench the spin in their vicinity and thus act as promotors by lowering the energy of transition state of important elementary steps. Experimental work in the Chorkendorff and Kibsgaard groups validated the effect for several ammonia synthesis catalysts. Another new effort was in translating the theory we developed to understand trends in heterogeneous catalysis to homogeneous catalysts. All of this work continues ....In all my career I have been fortunate to have worked with outstanding students and postdocs as well as some of the best scientists in the field. I have mentioned some of the colleagues in the above but it would be completely impossible to do all students and postdocs justice in this short piece. Let me just thank everyone profoundly. The picture above, taken at a conference celebrating my 70th birthday, shows many of the students and postdocs I have worked with over the years.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJens K.

Male echidnas have spurs on their hind legs which connect to a crural gland, similar to the platypus. Unlike platypus, echidnas do not attempt to strike with their spurs. The crural gland produces a milky substance during the breeding season. Platypuses weigh from 0.6 to 3.0 kg. Males possess a sharp spur on each hind leg that is connected to a venom gland located in the upper thigh region. Venom is only produced by sexually mature males from about 4 years of age. Platypuses are anesthetized using a mask placed over the bill and induced with isoflurane and oxygen. They are impossible to intubate because of their small gape, inability to visualize the larynx, and bulbous structure (torus linguae) at the base of the tongue. References Bodley K. 2019 .

For field capture of rhinoceroses on the ground or from a helicopter a robust and reliable darting method such as the Cap-Chur system is preferable. Recumbency and positioning are critical considerations for safe anesthesia of rhinoceroses whether in a zoological setting or in the wild. Respiratory depression is the most significant life-threatening complication encountered during routine anesthesia of the rhinoceros. The rhinoceros, like other large mammals, is prone to hyperthermia during capture and translocation. All black rhinoceroses require tranquilization during transport to preclude excessive struggle and associated trauma. Short-acting tranquilizers such as azaperone, xylazine or detomidine, and diazepam or midazolam are useful agents to produce a calming effect in rhinoceroses during transport.

                The synthesis of micro-and nano-particles must be precisely controlled to achieve the desired shape and composition, as these characteristics profoundly influence their applicative efficacy. A large body of literature aims at constantly improving structure/function of these materials by refining synthesis procedures. Within it, a growing field of chemistry focuses on green synthesis methods to provide more sustainable alternatives while maintaining the bioactive efficiency of the particles. For instance, this Research Topic features a study on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles synthesized using Azadirachta indica (neem) extract (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). The produced MgO nanoparticles exhibit remarkable stability under heat and in biological media, alongside notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Aligned with this search for greener processes and materials, another featured study reviews the development of silk fibroin-based scaffolds for tissue engineering (Ma et al., 2024). Silk, biosynthesized by over 200,000 arthropod species -including the Bombyx mori moth, whose silk is the most characterized -offers a rich source of fibroin, a natural biopolymer. Silk fibroin stands out for its mechanical strength, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural tunability. It can be used alone or combined with other materials to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.A focus in regenerative medicine consists in creating tissue alternatives to repair aging or diseased tissues and organs. It generally relies on the use of a scaffold for cell support. These scaffolds must meet precise guidelines to provide appropriate biomechanical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion and regulate phenotypic expression. Their conception thus requires control over shape, mechanical properties, and surface characteristics. The previously mentioned review on silk fibroin details the numerous possible processing techniques of this biomaterial (i.e. electrospinning, freeze-drying, solvent casting, gas foaming, particulate leaching, 3D printing) making it versatile and relevant for the repair of various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, blood vessel, and nerves (Ma et al., 2024). Nano-and micro-structuration of scaffolds is another approach to enhance scaffold features as explored in this research topic in a study that showcases the incorporation of graphene oxide to the pure hardystonite (used for bone repair) leading to the obtention of a porous nano-and microstructured hardystonite/reduced graphene oxide composite (Bagherpour et al., 2023). The produced biomaterial demonstrates enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mechanical strength. An additional study focuses on the nanoscale properties of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), also employed in bone repair (Su et al., 2023). Granular-shaped BCP nanoparticles were synthesized, and the nanoscale texturing of these materials enhanced biocompatibility and osteogenic features. Importantly, they demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, even under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. The ability of BCP nanoparticles to restore osteogenesis impaired by inflammation underscores their dual role in promoting bone regeneration and modulating the immune response.Nanometer-scaled materials can provide stronger antibacterial features. The silver-copper bimetallic nanoparticles featured in this issue exemplify this strategy (Hao et al., 2024). Silver and copper nanoparticles have superior antibacterial effects compared to their bulk or micron-size counterparts. Furthermore, combining these nanomaterials rather than using them individually amplifies their antibacterial efficacy while minimizing cytotoxicity. These nanoparticles have dynamic interactions in biological environments through metal ions release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which collectively boost localized antibacterial activity, minimizing systemic side effects (Hao et al., 2024).Bioinspired MgO NPs also exhibited targeted effects. They show selective cytotoxicity against liver hepatic cancer cells in comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial ones, encouraging their potential in anticancer therapies (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). Additionally, they demonstrate significant antidiabetic activity through the inhibition of key enzymes like &#945;glucosidase and &#945;-amylase, along with robust anti-inflammatory effects via protein stabilization and cytokine regulation. Antioxidant activity is another critical aspect of bioactive particles. By scavenging free radicals, MgO NPs protect tissues from oxidative stress, a major contributor to inflammation and chronic diseases.Similarly, BCP nanomaterials have shown remarkable bioactivity. They mitigate inflammation in macrophages and enhance osteogenic processes by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulating osteogenesis-related genes, such as Runx2 and OPN (Su et al., 2023). Notably, BCP nanoparticles can reverse the detrimental effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions on osteoblast activity. This dual functionality makes BCP nanoparticles promising candidates for applications in environments where inflammation impedes bone regeneration.The integration of micro-and nano-particles into regenerative medicine can not only support tissue regeneration but also actively engage in therapeutic processes. While these versatile biomaterials hold large promises, challenges still remain for their widespread adoption in the clinic. Among them, the assessment of long-term biocompatibility requires monitoring biomaterial evolution over years. It is a complex task, yet necessary, as these materials are designed to interact with biological systems over extended periods. Another challenge concerns their integration with advanced manufacturing, such as 3D printing, as well as the scalability and reproducibility of their manufacturing. This is necessary to ensure consistent production of high-quality particles for large-scale applications. In parallel to these technical hurdles come regulatory and translational barriers. However, as this field progresses and with sustained efforts to overcome these obstacles, we are optimistic that micro-and nanoparticles can pave the way for more effective medical solutions.</description>

This chapter discusses the methods for handling fish with and without anesthesia that have minimal impact on the animal and ultimately reduce stress when performed properly. Lungfish and polypterids possess true lungs with ventrally situated pneumatic duct openings in the alimentary canal instead of a traditional gas or "swim" bladder. Teleost fish have an anatomic separation between aerobic, slow-oxidative muscles and anaerobic, fast-twitch, glycolytic muscles. Propofol has been used as an immersion anesthetic in other species, including silver catfish, Nile tilapia, koi, Persian sturgeon, and goldfish with reported efficacy. Immobilization of fishes in the field is a commonplace event. Electroanesthesia is a common fisheries tool for group immobilization to tag, survey, or remove animals from an area. Considerations for immobilizing fish in remote areas include having portable equipment that can connect to car batteries or portable generators/batteries.

The field of reptile anesthesia has undergone a gradual and continuing evolution from hypothermia and manual restraint to contemporary balanced and well-controlled anesthesia. The most reliable vascular access site is the ventral tail vessels, located immediately ventral to the coccygeal vertebrae. In snakes, these vessels are mostly approached from the ventral midline, but in many lizards a lateral approach is often more convenient. Most monitoring modalities for domestic species can be applied to reptiles. Body temperature should be monitored with a cloacal or esophageal thermometer or temperature probe able to measure low temperatures. The clinical signs associated with induction of general anesthesia in reptiles are fairly consistent. Inhalational anesthesia is commonly used for induction and maintenance of reptile anesthesia. Recovery times in reptiles are prolonged compared to birds and mammals. References Anderson N , Wack R , Calloway L , Hetherington T , Williams J . 1999 .

They inhabit many different habitats, from tropical rain forests to deserts, from freshwater swamps to oceans. The wide variety of environments, dietary preferences, and activity levels explains the substantial differences in metabolic rate among chelonian species. The cardiovascular system is characterized by many morphological and functional peculiarities. The ventricular anatomy is such that, in physiologic conditions of normal ventilation, there is a high degree of separation between the systemic and pulmonary circulations, with minimal mixing between venous and arterial blood. An important factor that modulates cardiac shunting is thermoregulation. Among opioid analgesics, morphine has been shown to provide analgesia in chelonians whereas butorphanol, even at dosages largely exceeding the mammalian therapeutic doses, did not have any effect on thermal threshold. Recovery time from anesthesia appears to be prolonged in chelonians when compared to mammals exposed to the same anesthetic agent. References Bagatto B , Blankenship EL , Henry RP . 1997 .

                Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2&#8722;) breast cancer often develops resistance to first-line treatment, typically combining cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with hormone therapy (HT) [1, 2]. After an initial response, most patients become resistant, and compensatory mechanisms are not fully uncovered [3]. To address this, we analyzed HR+ resistant CAMA1 and 747D cells using whole-exome and RNA sequencing, supplemented by proteomics and target validation with human samples. Additionally, we conducted combination therapy trials using xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Detailed study designs and methods are provided in the Supplementary file. In a cohort of 27 patients with metastatic breast cancer, we observed reduced progression-free survival in second- and third-line therapies following progression post palbociclib-HT treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Resistant tumors showed reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and progesterone receptor (PR) and increased proliferation rates (Supplementary Figure S1B-D). CAMA1 and T47D cells, treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant (PF) for 2 years, developed resistance (CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR) confirmed by proliferation assays and elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Resistant cells exhibited reduced levels of ER&#945; and retinoblastoma protein (Supplementary Figure S2). Exome analysis revealed no drug resistance-related mutations (Supplementary Tables S2-S3), suggesting non-genetic factors. RNA sequencing of T47D cells treated with DMSO or PF for 20 days and T47D-PFR cells revealed 1,172 upregulated genes and 824 downregulated genes in the resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated increased fatty acid localization (Supplementary Figure S3B), with a heatmap showing elevated fatty acid uptake and metabolism-related genes, such as fatty acid binding protein-6 (FABP6), FABP7, cluster of differentiation-36 (CD36), and proteasome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR&#947;) in T47D-PFR cells (Figure 1A). Lipid droplets accumulated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant T47D and CAMA1 cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S3C). FABP6 levels were elevated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant cells, with CD36 overexpression unique to T47D-PFR cells at both protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3D-E), suggesting that lipid uptake might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress [4, 5]. This was supported by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in PF-treated parental cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, proteomic analysis in human biopsies revealed a functional network of 11 oxidative stress-triggered proteasomes (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Tables S4-S5) as indicators of oxidative stress [6]. Immunohistochemistry validated increased proteasome subunit alpha type-7 (PSMA7) in resistant biopsies (Supplementary Figure S4B). Ferroptosis inducers overcome resistance of HR+HER2&#8722; breast cancer cells to palbociclib-hormone therapy.

All represented genes had a P value &lt; 0.05. (B) Lipid droplet detection by BODIPY 493/503 staining in parental CAMA1 and T47D cells after treatment with the PF combination for 20 days, and in CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years.

Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (H) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with different combinations of DMSO, palbociclib (P) (0.3 &#181;mol/L), fulvestrant (F) (30 nmol/L), or eprenetapopt (Ep) (25 &#181;mol/L) for 7 days. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay.

(K) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-na&#239;ve HBCx-124 PDXs (5 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day (***P &lt; 0.001). (L) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-resistant HBCx-180 PDXs (8 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day. The difference between the measured tumor volumes was significant between the "vehicle" group and the eprenetapopt + fulvestrant + palbociclib (FPE) group from Day 25 until the end of the experiment (P &lt; 0.05). Tumor evolution formula is (Vf &#8722; V0 / V0) &#215; 100%, where V0 is the initial volume and Vf is the final volume measured at each time point.

We investigated whether cell survival is affected by ferroptosis&#8212;a type of non-apoptotic cell death linked to lipid peroxidation. GPX4 protein, the main protector against ferroptosis, was overexpressed in parental cells after PF treatment and in PF-resistant cells, even after drug wash-out, with no changes in mRNA levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S5A-C). Silencing GPX4 expression reduced cell proliferation in parental and PF-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S5D-F), indicating their reliance on GPX4. GPX4 overexpression was also observed in resistant human tumors (Figure 1F). Cells were treated with the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) and the antioxidant Trolox for 6 days. CAMA1 and T47D cells were insensitive to RSL3, whereas CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells showed high sensitivity to RSL3 (Figure 1G). Trolox reversed RSL3's effect in both cell lines (Figure 1G), highlighting the role of GPX4 in PF-resistant cell proliferation. Due to unverified safety of RLS3, we used eprenetapopt (Ep), a p53 activator and GSH depletory [7] proven safe in hematological cancer patients [8]. In vitro, CAMA1 and CAMA1-PFR cells were sensitive to Ep, while T47D cells were insensitive; T47D-PFR showed higher sensitivity (Figure 1H). To investigate the effect of pharmacologically induced ferroptosis on the palbociclib-fulvestrant response in vivo, we used nude mice implanted with estrogen pellets. Due to its low pharmacokinetics in mouse plasma [9], RSL3 was administered via intratumoral injection. Mice were treated with vehicle, PF, Ep, RSL3, a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and eprenetapopt (PFEp), or a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and RSL3 (PF-RSL3). PF effectively inhibited the growth of the CAMA1 xenografts, while CAMA1-PFR tumors were insensitive (Figure 1I and J). RSL3 alone did not affect CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, whereas PF-RSL3 demonstrated a strong antitumor effect (Figure 1J), suggesting that RSL3 sensitizes CAMA1-PFR cells to PF, or vice versa. Similarly, Ep alone did not inhibit CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, but its combination with PF completely abolished tumor growth (Figure 1J). To evaluate treatment effects on proliferation and cell death, we assessed Ki67, caspase-3 and hydroxynonenal (HNE) in tumors by immunohistochemistry. Parental CAMA1 tumors treated with PF showed a significant decrease in Ki67, with no effect on caspase-3, while CAMA1-PFR tumors exhibited no significant changes in either marker after treatment with PF, PFEp, or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6A-D). HNE labeling revealed no difference between PF- and vehicle-treated CAMA1 tumors (Supplementary Figure S6E), but HNE increased moderately in CAMA1-PFR tumors treated with RSL3 and significantly with PFEp or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6F), indicating potential cell death by ferroptosis. No treatments affected CD36 expression in either tumor type, although CAMA1-PFR xenografts showed significantly increased basal expression compared to human biopsies (Supplementary Figure S6G-J). To strengthen the translational impact of our findings, we used patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from HR+HER2&#8722; breast cancer patients without p53 mutations (Supplementary Figure S7A) [10]. Consistent with human samples, GPX4 protein was upregulated in the palbociclib-HT-resistant PDX model (HBCx-180) compared to the palbociclib-HT-na&#239;ve PDX model (HBCx-124) (Supplementary Figure S7B). While GPX4 mRNA levels were unaffected in resistant cells, its expression was significantly higher in HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S7C), suggesting specific transcriptional/translational regulation differing between in vitro and in vivo contexts. In the HBCx-124 model, all the tumors (n = 5) responded well to PF, with no added benefit from Ep (PFEp), although a partial response to Ep monotherapy was observed (Figure 1K). Conversely, the HBCx-180 model showed no significant response to PF or Ep, with significant differences in tumor volumes between PFEp and vehicle and Ep groups from Day 25 onward (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 1L). These results confirm that adding Ep to PF in PF-resistant tumors produces a strong antitumor effect. Ki67 labeling decreased with PF in the HBCx-124 PDX but not in the HBCx-180 PDX (Supplementary Figure S8A-B). Aside from reduction in caspase-3 labeling in the HBCx-124 treated with PF, no significant changes were observed with Ep or PFEp, and none of the treatment conditions affected HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S8C-D), indicating that proliferation and apoptosis are not affected in HBCx-180. HNE labeling suggested that PF promoted ferroptosis in HBCx-124, while only tumors treated with PFEp in HBCx-180 exhibited significant HNE increase compared to vehicle (Supplementary Figure S8E-F). PF slightly increased HNE in HBCx-124 without significance but the only vulnerability of HBCx-180 is attributed to ferroptosis induced with PFEp. The p53-dependent antitumor effect of eprenetapopt was excluded, as p53 expression was similar in parental and PF-resistant cells and in PDXs, while slightly elevated in resistant human tumors (Supplementary Figure S9). Finally, the addition of Ep or RSL3 to PF did not induce significant renal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity in mice (Supplementary Figure S10). In conclusion, HR+HER2&#8722; tumors resistant to palbociclib-HT are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers, highlighting the potential of collateral drug sensitivity and the promise of developing pro-ferroptosis agents for treating drug-resistant metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S11).

Much of the information relied on for anesthesia in cartilaginous fishes has been anecdotal. Many elasmobranchs housed in public aquaria share large systems with mixed species. Elasmobranchs are very responsive to behavioral conditioning and training techniques. Tonic immobility or "hypnosis" is a defensive behavior resulting in a temporary state of "profound and reversible motor inhibition elicited by some forms of physical restraint". Access to elasmobranchs vasculature is determined by the size and position of the animal rather than which vessel is most ideal. The use of chemical restraint can provide a safer, less stressful procedure for the fish and staff involved. Injectable anesthetics are an alternative when waterborne anesthesia is impractical due to large water volume or when sedation is necessary to safely capture animals from complex primary exhibits.

Amphibians are found from the equatorial rainforest to Canada, where they may remain frozen through the winter. Amphibians are routinely maintained in human care as pets, in laboratories, and in zoos for education, as well as conservation and reintroduction projects. The respiratory physiology of amphibians is unlike that of any other animal taxa. Vascular access is limited by animal size. Transillumination is a useful technique for highlighting the pathways of major vessels. Intramuscular injections can be administered in the large muscles of the hind limbs. The aquatic nature and skin permeability of amphibians makes topical use of anesthetic agents a convenient means of achieving systemic effects. Respiratory ventilation is reduced or absent during amphibian anesthesia. The dermis is kept moist to allow for efficient dermal respiration. Analgesia should be considered for any noxious procedures in amphibians. References Adami C , Spadeavecchia C , Angeli G , d'Ovidio D . 2015 .

Across species of raptors, the anatomy of the respiratory system does not vary appreciably except in size, and it exhibits the basic avian anatomy and physiology of lungs and air sacs as found in other avian groups. Procedures involving anesthesia in raptors are regularly conducted in dorsal, lateral, and sternal recumbency without marked overt differences in ventilation or manner of managing the anesthetic episode. Inhalant anesthetic agents are the workhorse of avian anesthesia and presently are highly recommended over injectable agents. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam and midazolam have been used successfully for short nonpainful procedures or preanesthetic sedation. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, produces dose-related unconsciousness and analgesia, but with highly variable species-specific results and recoveries characterized by uncontrolled movements.
