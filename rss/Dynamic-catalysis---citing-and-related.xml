                Abstract Constructing dual catalytic sites with charge density differences is an efficient way to promote urea electrosynthesis from parallel and CO 2 reduction yet still challenging in static system. Herein, a dynamic system is constructed by precisely controlling the asymmetric charge density distribution in an Au&#8208;doped coplanar Cu 7 clusters&#8208;based 3D framework catalyst (Au@cpCu 7 CF). In Au@cpCu 7 CF, the redistributed charge between Au and Cu atoms changed periodically with the application of pulse potentials switching between &#8722;0.2 and &#8722;0.6 V and greatly facilitated the electrosynthesis of urea. Compared with the static condition of pristine cpCu 7 CF (FE urea = 5.10%), the FE urea of Au@cpCu 7 CF under pulsed potentials is up to 55.53%. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high potential of &#8722;0.6 V improved the adsorption of * HNO 2 and * NH 2 on Au atoms and inhibited the reaction pathways of by&#8208;products. While at the low potential of &#8722;0.2 V, the charge distribution between Au and Cu atomic sites facilitated the thermodynamic C&#8211;N coupling step. This work demonstrated the important role of asymmetric charge distribution under dynamic regulation for urea electrosynthesis, providing a new inspiration for precise control of electrocatalysis.</description>
