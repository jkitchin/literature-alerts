      <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured V&#8208;Doped CoPx@FeOOH for Efficient Seawater Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract As a renewable energy conversion method, the hydrogen from seawater electrolysis needs to overcome problems such as chlorination reaction and corrosion resistance. Considering these questions, it is vital to design a highly efficient and corrosion&#8208;resistant catalyst. Here, we developed a vanadium&#8208;doped cobalt phosphide encapsulated within an iron oxyhydroxide shell (V&#8208;CoPx@FeOOH) as an efficient core&#8208;shell electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater electrolytes. In particular, the OER overpotential of the V&#8208;CoPx@FeOOH catalyst at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 was 270 mV. Notably, V&#8208;CoPx||V&#8208;CoPx@FeOOH was able to operate in alkaline seawater at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 for more than 1000 h, showing excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the enhanced HER activity is attributed to the introduction of V, which strengthens the bonding between Co sites and H atoms, and the optimized OER activity results from the presence of both V and Fe, which together optimize the bonding strength between Co sites and OOH intermediates. The highly efficient catalyst of the core&#8208;shell structure has great prospects for overall water/seawater electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Multistage System Enables Selective Recovery of Gold and Palladium from Electronic Waste Leachate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/eem2.70085</link>

                Selective extraction of precious metals from urban mines plays a crucial role in mitigating the risk of depletion of precious metal resources and reducing waste pollution. However, a major obstacle in precious metal extraction lies in the difficulty of distinguishing the subtle differences in the physicochemical characteristics between them, especially gold and palladium. Herein, a proton&#8208;driven separation system was presented for cascade recovery of gold and palladium from waste&#8208;printed circuit boards (W&#8208;PCBs) leachate using poly(amidoxime) (PAO) hydrogel. This exhibits an ultra&#8208;high capacity, extra&#8208;fast rate, and excellent selectivity for the extraction of Au(III) and Pd(II). Notably, the separation of Au(III) and Pd(II) can be achieved with high selectivity at pH = 0, resulting in a remarkable separation factor of k Au(III)/Pd(II) = 36.5. This was demonstrated to originate from the differential mechanism of PAO hydrogel for the capture of Au(III) and Pd(II) under proton&#8208;mediated conditions. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism, the proton&#8208;driven cascade recovery system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in sequentially recovering 99.92% of gold and 99.05% of palladium from W&#8208;PCBs acid leachate. This research opens up a strategy to precisely separate and recover precious metals from e&#8208;waste of urban mines.</description>

      <title>Advances and Outlook of Nickel&#8208;Based MOFs&#8211;LDHs Materials for Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202500483</link>

                Abstract This review focuses on the advances and outlook of integrated Ni&#8208;based MOFs (Metal&#8208;Organic Framework) and LDHs (Layered Double Hydroxides) photo(electro) catalysts, and addresses the pivotal gap in water splitting for sustainable energy generation application. MOFs and LDHs are two classes of materials with high potential for applications in photo(electro)catalytic water splitting reaction. However, challenges such as limited intrinsic activity, low electrical conductivity of a single material, lack of more exposed active sites, weak mass transport ability, and poor crystalline structure remain. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies including doping, the development of composites, nano&#8208;structuration are used to solve these issues. Machine learning and artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted advanced in situ characterization techniques are proposed as unavoidable tools to address these challenges and optimize the catalyst design. This review outlines the key parameters involved in the assessment of the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance of water&#8208;splitting catalysts. The importance of density functional theory in Ni&#8208;based MOFs and LDHs for electrocatalytic water splitting is emphasized. Details about the balance of high activity along with long&#8208;term stability as a crucial requirement for large&#8208;scale applications are provided. This review will propel the knowledge and know&#8208;how in using Ni&#8208;based MOFs/LDHs as electro(photo)catalysts for hydrogen (H 2 ) production, and guide the researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Computational screening of chalcogenides for intermediate band solar cells surpassing the Shockley-Queisser limit</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7655/adf095</link>
      <description>Matteo Cagnoni, Journal of Physics Energy. 7(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413090529

                Abstract Intermediate band solar cells offer a promising avenue to surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of    &#8764;  30   %    that constrains conventional single-junction devices, with the potential to approach an efficiency limit of    &#8764;  45   %    in terrestrial environments by incorporating a metallic band within the valence-conduction gap. Yet, their practical realization is challenged by difficulties in developing suitable intermediate band (IB) materials. Current approaches, which involve adding inclusions or utilizing highly mismatched alloys, often degrade material quality or present significant technological hurdles. A possible solution that remains underexplored, is to identify crystalline materials that inherently possess an IB and fine-tune their properties. In this work, thousands of crystalline chalcogenides are analyzed using a detailed balance model to quantitatively evaluate their expected efficacy as IB materials. Notably, orthorhombic     VB   1     VIA   2     and     IA   4     VIA   6     compounds, such as     Ta   1     Se   2     and     Cs   4     S   6     , are projected to achieve maximum efficiencies exceeding 35%, that is, surpassing the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. The interplay of IB filling and chemical substitution on the properties of these systems is analyzed, to unravel the impact on performance. This study not only identifies new material candidates for IB solar cells, but also provides insights into efficiency-property relations, hence advancing the understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Lattice-matched antiperovskite-perovskite system toward all-solid-state batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62860-1</link>

                Inorganic solid electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for realizing all-solid-state batteries because they eliminate flammable, low boiling-point liquids in lithium-ion battery cells, improving safety and cycle life. In this study, we present a highly lattice-matched composite solid electrolyte consisting of an antiperovskite-perovskite system, offering the benefits of both antiperovskites as melt-infiltratable solid electrolytes and perovskites as fast-ion conductors. Atomistic simulations predict significant lithium-ion diffusion at the interface between cubic Li2OHCl and Li0.31La0.56TiO3. The incorporation of fluorine enables room-temperature operation by stabilizing the high-temperature cubic phase of Li2OHCl1-xFx and reduces the lattice mismatch ratio to 0.8% at the interface through lattice contractions. The composite solid electrolyte was synthesized via pressure-assisted melt infiltration. The solid electrolyte effectively infiltrates conventional lithium-ion battery electrodes while maintaining a stable interface structure. Electrochemical testing demonstrates promising charge-discharge characteristics, including long cycle life and rate performance. Intricate infiltration of the solid electrolyte into an electrode structure composed of active materials with microcracks and high surface area enables stable operation by mitigating degradation phenomena typically observed in liquid electrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries face safety and capacity limitations. Here, authors develop a composite solid electrolyte combining anti-perovskite and perovskite phases, enabling low-temperature processing and stable interfaces. This advance supports safer, high-performance all-solid-state batteries.</description>

                Abstract Controlling the non&#8208;stoichiometry is an effective way to tune physicochemical properties of functional oxides and explore novel physical phenomena in complex oxides. Therefore, quantitative control of oxygen non&#8208;stoichiometry in perovskite oxides plays an important role in understanding the mechanism of topotactic phase transition and improving the applicability of electrochemical devices. Here, an electrochemical titration cell is fabricated to control the oxygen non&#8208;stoichiometry of a Bi 0.4 Ca 0.6 FeO 3&#8208; &#948; thin film grown on yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia substrate. The amount of oxygen pumped into the thin film depending on the applied voltage is quantitatively determined through chronoamperometry measurements. Non&#8208;monotonic changes in lattice parameters are observed using X&#8208;ray diffraction. Considerable negative Raman chemical shifts have occurred even in the range of small applied voltages that result in little changes in the non&#8208;stoichiometry or average lattice parameters. These observations on chemo&#8208;mechanical coupling can be interpreted as characteristics of vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite oxides. This work offers useful insights into the mechanism of topotactic phase transition in perovskite oxides.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Catalysis for Controlling Selectivity in the Hydrogenation of Cinnamaldehyde to Propylbenzene Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202501054</link>
      <description>Sana Frindy, Shiqi Wang, Sam Sullivan&#8208;Allsop, Rongsheng Cai, Thomas J. A. Slater, Sarah J. Haigh, Pedro H. C. Camargo, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413103761

                The selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, such as cinnamaldehyde (CAL), into value&#8208;added aromatic hydrocarbons like propylbenzene (PPR) remains a formidable challenge due to competing C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O hydrogenation pathways. Here, a plasmon&#8208;enhanced catalytic strategy employing Au@Au 3 Pd core&#8211;shell nanoparticles supported on silica is reported. The catalyst features a plasmonic Au core and a 1 nm Au 3 Pd alloyed shell (25 at% Pd), enabling light&#8208;driven modulation of reaction selectivity. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst achieves complete CAL conversion with a &#8776;34% yield of PPR, corresponding to a 7.7&#8208;fold enhancement in turnover frequency relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that interfacial electronic coupling between the Au core and Pd&#8208;rich shell upshifts the Pd d &#8208;band center and enhances charge transfer, promoting both C&#63742;C and C&#63742;O hydrogenation steps followed by hydrogenolysis to PPR. This study demonstrates a robust approach to overcome selectivity limitations in multifunctional molecule hydrogenation by harnessing localized surface plasmon resonance effects. The insights gained offer a foundation for the rational design of light&#8208;responsive bimetallic catalysts for selective and sustainable transformations.</description>

      <title>Elucidating ion capture and transport mechanisms of Preyssler anions in aqueous solutions using biased MACE-accelerated MD simulations</title>

                Equilibrium and biased multi-atomic cluster expansion (MACE) accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in aqueous solutions are performed to investigate the ion capture and transport mechanisms of the {P5W30} Preyssler anion (PA) as the smallest representative member of the extended polyoxometalate (POM) family with an internal cavity. The unique interatomic interactions present in the internal cavity vs the exterior of PA are carefully investigated using equilibrium MACE MD simulations for two representative Na(H2O)@PA and Na@PA complexes in aqueous solutions. Our careful analyses of radial distribution functions and coordination numbers show that the presence of confined water in Na(H2O)@PA has profound modulating effects on the nature of the interactions of the encapsulated ion with the oxygens of the PA cavity. Using well-converged MACE-accelerated multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics simulations with nanosecond timescales, two different associative (ion exchange) and dissociative (ion ejection) ion transport mechanisms were carefully investigated for Na+ as one of the most abundant and representative ions present in seawater and saline solutions. By comparing systems with and without confined water, it was found that the presence of only one pre-encapsulated confined water in Na(H2O)@PA dramatically changes the free energy landscape of ion transport processes. It was also found that the contraction and dilation of the two windows present in PA directly influence the Na+ and H2O transport. The results from this work are helpful, as they show a viable path toward tuning the ion exchange and transport phenomena in aqueous solutions of POM molecular clusters and frameworks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00866</link>
      <description>Rohit Goswami, M.V. Masterov, Satish Kamath, Alejandro Pe&#241;a-Torres, Hannes J&#243;nsson, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413108455

                The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermes, E. D. [ J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 6974-6988]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling of Mass Transport Effects on Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00914</link>

                We develop a multiscale theoretical model integrating atomic-scale density functional theory (DFT), microkinetic simulations, and continuum transport models to elucidate the mass transport effects on the kinetics of the OER on IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts, which bridges atomic-level insights with macroscopic electrochemical behavior. By coupling constant potential DFT simulations of reaction energetics with microkinetic equations and Nernst-Planck-Poisson transport physics, we resolve atomic-scale reaction pathways under experimentally relevant concentration gradients. During the reaction process, significant variations in the concentrations of H+, OH-, and adsorbates are identified at the electrode surface under different potentials, leading to the local pH shifts and ion depletion at electrode interfaces, which fundamentally alter the rate-determining steps. The framework reproduces experimental Tafel slopes (39/146 mV/dec for RuO2; 59/118 mV/dec for IrO2) without empirical fitting, highlighting the critical role of ion concentration gradients in governing the reaction kinetics. Our unified framework emphasizes the mass transport imperative on revealing the reaction mechanisms in realistic electrochemical environments, offering a generalizable strategy for designing and evaluating the novel OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Observation of dendrite formation at Li metal-electrolyte interface by a machine-learning enhanced constant potential framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62824-5</link>

                Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional molecular dynamics simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential condition. In this work, we propose a constant potential approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our simulations show that inhomogeneous Li depositions, following Li aggregations in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphases, can initiate dendrites nucleation. Our study provides microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic constant potential conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling complex electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Selectivity trends in two-electron oxygen reduction: insights from two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1039/d5sc04904k</link>

                Advancing the discovery of novel materials for electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) while rationalizing and quantifying selectivity trends has been an ambitious objective. A recently introduced selectivity descriptor, &#916;&#916;G, published in Chem Catal. 2023, 3(3), 100568, utilizes thermodynamic analysis of adsorption free energies of key ORR intermediates (&#916;G OOH* and &#916;G O*) along with the free energy of H2O2 to quantify selectivity and establish trends. This model has been successfully applied to a large database of binary alloys, demonstrating strong potential for predicting selective materials Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202404677. In this study, we systematically explore a diverse range of active sites in carbon-based structures, boron nitrides, and single atom catalysts, emerging classes of materials for 2e-ORR. We assess the effectiveness of &#916;&#916;G in capturing selectivity trends and distinguishing sites that are both catalytically active and highly selective. Our findings highlight that not all active sites in carbon-based materials reported with high activity inherently exhibit high selectivity, with only a small fraction meeting both criteria. This work highlights the importance of &#916;&#916;G as a predictive tool, providing valuable insights for designing selective and active two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Machine Learning with High&#8208;Throughput DFT to Design Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202501271</link>

                Abstract The development of efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) has garnered significant attention within the scientific community. However, the extensive scope of material experimentation, coupled with high research and development costs and prolonged research cycles, severely hampers the efficient advancement of related materials. In this study, the HER activity of 90 types of SACs is systematically investigated, which consist of single transition metal (TM) and/or nonmetal (NM) atoms bonded in graphyne (TM&#8208;NM&#8208;GY), by synergizing machine learning algorithms with high&#8208;throughput DFT computations. The findings reveal that the HER catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;GY, Fe&#8208;B&#8208;GY, Ni&#8208;B&#8208;GY, Pd&#8208;B&#8208;GY, Sc&#8208;N&#8208;GY, Co&#8208;N&#8208;GY, Y&#8208;N&#8208;GY, and Pd&#8208;N&#8208;GY surpasses that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, non&#8208;metallic B or N atom doping can effectively modulate the HER performance of SACs. Furthermore, it is confirmed that HER activity correlates with characteristic factors such as the bond length of the coordinating atoms, d&#8208;band center, metal binding height, charge transfer, and ICOHP. Finally, machine learning stacking models have proven efficient in predicting and designing superior HER SACs. It is anticipated that these insights will accelerate the prediction and design of corresponding SACs.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CHGNet Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potential against DFT and EXAFS: The Case of Layered WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at a low computational cost, making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pretrained on vast ab initio data sets, rigorous validation remains essential for their ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (density functional theory (DFT)) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves the alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using &#8764;100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning data set sizes.</description>

                We report a colloidal synthesis strategy for producing MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 nanoheterostructures under mild conditions, i.e., low temperature and ambient pressure. The role of carboxylic acid ligands in directing the synthesis is systematically explored, revealing that lower ligand concentrations along with low-molecular weight molecules favor the formation of well-defined MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the resulting nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical surface area and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity compared to their single-component counterparts. Specifically, MnxOy@Ni(OH)2 achieves a low overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, a Tafel slope of 61 mV dec&#8211;1, and a low charge transfer resistance of 9 &#937;. The improved OER performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the Ni(OH)2 nanosheets, which facilitate *OOH intermediate formation, and the MnO2 component, known for its intrinsic catalytic activity. Additionally, Mn3O4 serves as a stabilizing phase and precursor to MnO2, contributing to the overall durability and structural integrity of the catalyst.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for the progress of future energy conversion and storage systems. Herein, a fully conjugated ladder organic framework is designed with densely populated cobalt sites (HATN&#8208;BiSalphen@KB). The molecular characteristics of the catalytic sites provide a trustworthy model for investigating the oxygen catalysis mechanism. Theoretical calculations combined with in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy demonstrate that the electronic interaction of the Co 2 N 4 O 2 and CoN 2 Cl 2 sites shifts the d &#8208;band center of Co atoms, optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption energetics and boosting bifunctional catalytic performance. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving a remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half&#8208;wave potential of 0.983 V alongside a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . In addition, the assembled rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrate a high peak power density of 254.1 mW cm &#8722;2 and outstanding charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability for 450 h. This work provides valuable insights into designing advanced bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts through atomic&#8208;level modulation of the coordination environment.</description>

                Abstract The limited choice of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers hinders their large-scale commercialization. Cobalt-based catalysts are promising candidates and usually undergo surface reconstruction into CoOOH-like structures. However, the directly synthesized CoOOH has not yet been investigated in acidic environments. Here, we show that the CoOOH is active across the whole pH range, while its redox features are pH dependent. Operando hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations show a pH-induced change in Co oxidation onset, but no change in the coverage of redox-active Co species before the oxygen evolution reaction. The pH-dependent catalytic performance is connected to the interfacial Co oxidative transformations under electrocatalytic conditions. By combining the kinetic isotope effect and the apparent activation energy with theoretical verification, we offer the mechanistic discussion of the possible reaction pathway for CoOOH. In addition, CoOOH demonstrates a stable cell potential of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 400 h in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. These results shed light on both the fundamental electrochemical properties of CoOOH and its potential for practical device applications.</description>

      <title>A Smart Workflow for Performing the Electrochemical Evaluation of Fuel Cell Catalysts in a Precise Way with Ultra-High Reproducibility</title>

                The reproducibility of the rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests has been decisively limited by environmental and process variability in conventional manual sample preparation. To address this challenge, we present autoRDE-film, an automated platform that integrates force-controlled robotic polishing and process-controlled drop-coating to facilitate highly consistent RDE sample preparation. This mechanism reduces the standard deviation of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limiting current from 0.7 mA cm&#8211;2 (traditional scheme) to 0.07 mA cm&#8211;2 and the standard deviation of the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) from 0.038 to 0.004 V, ensuring exceptional batch-to-batch consistency. With the help of 480 RDE sample datasets generated by autoRDE-film, we have developed a ResNet-18-based deep learning model that correlates the film morphology with their electrochemical performance, enabling rapid quality classification with an accuracy of 96.3%. The combined workflow achieves a success rate of 90% for uniform coatings in batch preparations, far surpassing those of traditional approaches. By quantitatively controlling all preparation parameters, autoRDE-film establishes a universal and high-efficiency framework for evaluating ORR catalysts, which can be extended to the evaluation of fuel cell and water electrolysis catalysts and offers a transformative tool for AI-aided electrocatalyst optimization.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented robustness of physics-informed atomic energy models at and beyond room temperature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7048965/v1</link>

                Abstract Machine-learned potentials have become widely adopted alternatives to traditional electronic structure and molecular mechanics methods. However, despite excelling on fixed test sets, machine-learned potentials remain prone to instability when deployed in molecular dynamics simulations, particularly at elevated temperatures. Here we present the first physics-informed Gaussian process (GP)-based atomic energy models that achieve practically unlimited stability in NVT simulations at temperatures as high as 1000 K. Our findings highlight the importance of the GP prior mean function and demonstrate the models' ability to predict restoring forces that preserve the system&#8217;s physical integrity. The quantum chemical topology information embedded in these models acts as an inductive bias to mitigate arbitrary fluctuations in the predicted atomic energies. Finally, the models' robustness is evidenced by 50 successful simulations of four flexible organic molecules (peptide-capped glycine and serine, malondialdehyde and aspirin) yielding a cumulative simulation time of 0.5 microsecond completed within two CPU days.</description>

                Electrochemical processes are of particular interest in modern chemical technologies as they have numerous advantages over classical approaches. While computational support for investigating thermochemical reaction mechanisms is well established, there is still no consistent methodology for modeling electrochemical processes beyond the computational hydrogen electrode. This work addresses this gap through the study of the Shono&#8208;type oxidation of N &#8208;formylpyrrolidine. Combining density functional theory calculations, the concept of computational Fc + /Fc electrode, Marcus&#8211;Hush approach, and Butler&#8211;Volmer model, the reaction mechanism is elucidated, including the identification of the role and position of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Additionally, simulated cyclic voltammograms are in excellent agreement with experimental studies performed in parallel.</description>

                Computational electrochemistry is hard&#9472;anybody who has ever tried will know. We argue that the reasons for its complexity lie not only in the multiscale nature of electrochemical processes but also in the rapid, ongoing method development in the field. This has resulted in a lack of clear guidelines and many open discussions in the community. These issues were also the topic of a recent Lorentz Center workshop, the key take-away messages of which are highlighted in this Perspective. In particular, we discuss why the choice between constant potential and constant charge simulations is less trivial than it may seem, why interpreting electrochemical reaction free energy diagrams can be challenging, why the Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck equation is not all there is, and why we desperately need more benchmarking in the field.</description>

                The Pt/TiO2 interface has shown promise as a photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, understanding hydrogen and water splitting reactions on the Pt surface of the Pt/TiO2 interface remains a significant challenge. The Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Rietveld refinement analysis, which revealed reflections attributed to Pt(1 1 1) and anatase TiO2(h k l). Theoretical modeling of the Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface consists of approximately 60% TiO2 and 40% Pt, as determined by Rietveld refinement. The electronic properties were obtained using density functional theory (DFT)/plane-wave calculations on a model consisting of 39 atoms. The band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) of Pt3/TiO2(h k l) showed a new state between the valence and conduction bands, with contributions from the Pt 5d state, indicating metallic behavior. The initial steps of hydrogen and water splitting, as well as the transition states, were determined using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method for the reactions H2&#8594;Hads*+Hads* and H2Oads&#8594;OHads*+Hads* on the Pt3 surface of the Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interface. The Pt3/TiO2(1 0 1) interface exhibited the lowest activation energy (0.19 eV) for hydrogen molecule splitting, an exothermic reaction. Both Pt3/TiO2(h k l) interfaces exhibited an activation energy of approximately 1.4 eV for water splitting, an endothermic reaction. Therefore, hydrogen molecule splitting on the Pt3 surface is favorable, whereas water splitting is not, which may limit the hydrogen production rate (HGR) compared to other catalysts.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Complex Oxide Membranes on Flexible Metallic Support</title>

                Abstract Controlling material functionalities via external stimuli is a cornerstone of modern science and technology. One effective strategy involves tuning mechanical strain, which can be induced through lattice mismatch, electric fields, or applied mechanical force. Recent advances in fabricating freestanding single&#8208;crystalline complex oxide membranes have opened new opportunities for integrating these materials onto previously incompatible platforms such as metals and flexible polymers for next&#8208;generation device applications. A key step in strain engineering is understanding and controlling the integration of such materials with flexible substrates. In this study, the integration and adhesion of freestanding single&#8208;crystalline La 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 (LSMO(001)) membranes onto metallic surfaces (Au, Pt, and TiN) coated on flexible polymer substrates is demonstrated. It is found that the choice of metal underlayer significantly influences the ability to strain the membrane. Using TiN&#8208;coated polymer support, a uniform strain of &#8776;1% in LSMO membranes, along with strong adhesion between the membrane and substrate, is achieved. Theoretical calculations reveal that strong Ti&#9472;O bonding and compact in&#8208;plane lattice matching at the LSMO(001)/TiN(111) interface lower the interface formation energy compared to noble metals. These findings offer valuable insights for selecting suitable platforms to apply external mechanical stress to freestanding oxide membranes, facilitating their integration into flexible electronic systems.</description>

                Improving the catalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting in acidic media is crucial for the production of clean and renewable hydrogen energy. Herein, we study the OER electrocatalytic properties of various active sites on four exposed (110) and (1&#175;10) surfaces of Sn-doped RuO2 (Sn/RuO2) with antiferromagnetic arrangements in acidic environments. The Sn/RuO2 bulk structure with the Cm space group exhibits favorable thermodynamic stability. The coordinatively unsaturated metal (Mcus) sites distributed on the right branch of the volcano plot are generally more active than the bridge-bonded lattice oxygen (Obr) sites located on the left. Different from the conventional knowledge that the most active site is located in the nearest neighbor of the doped atom, it has a lower OER overpotential when the active site is 3.6 &#197; away from the doped Sn atom. Among the sites studied, the 46-Rucus site exhibits the optimal OER catalytic performance. The inherent factors affecting the OER activity of each site on the Sn/RuO2 surface are further analyzed, including the center of the d/p band at the active sites, the average electrostatic potential of the ions, and the number of transferred electrons. This work provides a reminder for the selection of active sites used to evaluate catalytic performance, which will benefit the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Emergent B2 chemical orderings in the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys studied via first-principles theory and atomistic modelling</title>

                Abstract We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of ab initio electronic structure theory&#8212;namely a concentration wave analysis&#8212;and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys&#8217; electronic structure, with hybridisation between the sp states of Al and the d states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys&#8217; smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</description>
