                The formulation of a structured framework dedicated to the systematic review of the literature, identification of potential compounds, theoretical quantum chemistry characterization, and assessment of the significance of stability descriptors is essential for accelerating the discovery of two-dimensional materials for technological applications. In this work, we selected the two-dimensional monochalcogenides (MQ), which have attracted increased interest due to their potential applications in future devices, as prototype materials for the present investigation. Our framework started with a natural language processing analysis of more than 5400 articles, revealing a growing research interest in the two-dimensional MQ compounds, especially in electronics, energy, and fundamental studies. This led to the selection of 27 diverse MQ compounds across 13 distinct two-dimensional structural phases for density functional theory calculations, resulting in an extensive database of physicochemical properties. We evaluated formation enthalpies, uncovering clear stability trends (e.g., stability declines with heavier chalcogens, dynamic robustness of GeSe), and evaluated equilibrium lattice parameters, noting predictable expansions and significant anisotropies. Bader charge analysis offered insights into charge-transfer and ionicity trends. Our electronic structure analysis identified band gaps (direct or indirect, depending on the M element group and the weight of the chalcogen) and optical absorption anisotropies significantly influenced by crystal symmetry and spin orbit coupling. Importantly, band alignment calculations classified all possible heterojunctions as type I, II, or III, underscoring their extensive potential for future optoelectronic device development. Additionally, we incorporated machine learning, using a random forest approach, along with our density functional theory calculations to accurately forecast trends in energetic properties. This analysis identified the electronic charge as a highly significant stability descriptor among the 34 descriptors, underscoring its importance for future machine learning endeavors. Hence, this study offers a streamlined framework for the characterization and discovery of promising two-dimensional materials, highlighting the synergy between data-driven analysis and quantum-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Water Oxidation in Medium-Entropy Spinel Oxides via Lattice Oxygen Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.5c02570</link>

                The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires advancements in both the mechanism understanding and material design. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) typically has a lower thermodynamic barrier than the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), yet controlling the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate efficient lattice oxygen activation in a spinel-structured CoFeMoRu medium-entropy oxide (CoFeMoRuMEO) catalyst through strategic octahedral engineering. The introduction of Mo increases the electron density at the Co sites, thereby weakening OH adsorption and suppressing CoOOH formation via the AEM pathway. Meanwhile, compressed RuO6 octahedra create shortened Ru&#8211;O bonds, enhancing Ru&#8211;O covalency and facilitating the critical O&#8211;O coupling step. As a result, the CoFeMoRuMEO catalyst achieves a remarkable overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, setting a new benchmark for medium-to-high-entropy OER catalysts. Our work provides valuable insights into the transformation of the OER mechanism and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Activity on Two-Dimensional Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c13688</link>
      <description>Xiaoping Gao, Yanan Zhou, Wenhua Zhang, Jinlong Yang, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415101802

                Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process to generate ammonia (NH3). Exploring NRR electrocatalysts with efficient performance and stability is crucial for NH3 production. In this work, on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically studied various TMO4&#8211;HTP and TMN4&#8211;HTP (TM refers to V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, and Pt; HTP refers to hexatriphenylene) of conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as potential electrocatalysts for the NRR. The strong interaction between TM atoms and the O4&#8211;HTP/N4&#8211;HTP substrates could guarantee the thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities of the designed TMO4&#8211;HTP and TMN4&#8211;HTP. The calculated results suggest that ReO4&#8211;HTP, MoO4&#8211;HTP, and MoN4&#8211;HTP could serve as promising electrocatalysts. Moreover, ReO4&#8211;HTP possesses the highest activity with a calculated limiting potential value of &#8722;0.34 V. Notably, ReO4&#8211;HTP exhibits good NRR selectivity with the effective suppression of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results contribute to searching for NRR electrocatalysts and highlight a potentially efficient class of catalysts based on 2D MOF materials for electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Narrowing the Kinetic Gap Between Alkaline and Acidic Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions Through Intermediate Behaviors Regulated on D&#8208;p Hybridized Pd&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202513616</link>
      <description>Lixin Su, Hao Wu, Shengnan Zhou, R. Qian, Chenxi Cui, Shaokun Zhang, Liqing Wu, Wenting Li, Huan Pang, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415152029

                Abstract The kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) decline by orders of magnitude when varying from acidic to alkaline environments. Consequently, narrowing the kinetic gap between alkaline and acidic HOR (acid&#8211;base kinetic gap) and identifying the prominent reaction intermediates under varying pH conditions remain significant yet challenging. Herein, through introducing p&#8208;block Ga and Sn elements, the HOR behaviors of the constructed d&#8208;p hybridized Pd&#8208;based catalysts are investigated under different electrolyte pH, particularly in alkaline and acidic conditions. Remarkably, the specific activity of PdGa/C alloy surpasses that of other prepared Pd&#8208;based catalysts in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Additionally, the PdGa/C alloy exhibits the smallest acid&#8211;base kinetic gap among these catalysts. Combining experimental results and theoretical calculations, it is determined that the incorporation of Ga optimizes the electronic structure of Pd via d&#8208;p orbital hybridization, thereby enhancing the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, facilitating the HOR process, and narrowing the acid&#8211;base kinetic gap. More critically, it can be inferred that the decisive reaction species for HOR vary with increasing pH, namely, it transitions from H/H 2 O species in acidic conditions to OH/H 2 O species in alkaline conditions, which accounts for the observed trends in alkaline/acidic activity as well as acid&#8211;base kinetic gap.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Metal-Doped Graphitic Materials for Enhanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c10546</link>
      <description>Vy T. Nguyen, Xueyan Lin, Rishav Kumar Baranwal, Haiyan Tan, David P. Wright, Zhaoyang Fan, Bin Wang, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415165641

                Atomically dispersed metal atoms within graphitic carbon have shown great potential in enhancing the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs), though the fundamental principles to guide their rational design remain to be fully established. Here, we report a combined computational and experimental study demonstrating that a group of metals (Ti, V, Mo, and Nb) incorporated into graphitic carbon have promising catalytic properties due to three factors: strong binding with lithium sulfides, reduced redox overpotentials, and low kinetic barriers for Li&#8211;S bond activation. In contrast, metals such as Fe and Mn show moderate catalytic behavior, while Ni representing a third group of elements has worse performance. To validate these computational predictions, we synthesized and studied three representative metal elements&#9472;Nb, Fe, and Ni&#9472;each exhibiting distinct capabilities in binding LiPSs/Li2S and catalyzing polysulfide conversion with varying overpotentials and kinetic barriers. Among them, Nb delivered the most exceptional performance, including superior rate capability (679.3 mA h g&#8211;1 at 5 C), high capacity retention (837.5 mA h g&#8211;1), and a low capacity decay rate (0.023% per cycle) after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work demonstrates an effective strategy that combines theoretical screening and experimental validation in exploring atomically dispersed metal catalysts for LSBs.</description>

      <title>Mixed Ionic&#8211;Covalent Bonds Achieve Durable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12381</link>
      <description>Shicheng Zhu, Ruoou Yang, Yingying Xu, Xintong Li, Zhengxuan Shi, Lin Yu, Youwen Liu, Huiqiao Li, Tianyou Zhai, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415166781

                The widespread deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is hindered by the instability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts under acidic conditions, stemming from coupled degradation mechanisms: lattice oxygen overoxidation (driven by high metal-oxygen (M-O) covalency) and acid-induced metal leaching/collapse. Here, we introduce an electronegativity-guided Li- and Ru-doped spinel Co3O4 (LRCO) catalyst featuring mixed Li-O (ionic) and Ru/Co-O (covalent) bonding. This design simultaneously stabilizes lattice oxygen via strong Li-O anchoring and modulates metal valence states through Ru-O-Co electron sharing, preventing overoxidation. Operando studies reveal a potential-dependent mechanism where Ru donates electrons to Co at low potentials, forming active Ru species, and electron redistribution prevents Ru overoxidation at high potentials. Crucially, Li-O bonds effectively suppress oxygen vacancy formation throughout, and Ru-O coordination remains stable, even at high potentials. LRCO achieves a record-low overpotential of 141 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with &gt;3,300 h stability. Integrated PEM electrolyzers operated &gt;720 h at 1 A cm-2, achieving a key milestone toward next-decade industry targets.</description>

      <title>W&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; Single-Cluster-Mediated Syngas Electrosynthesis in Single-Sandwich-Layer ZnAl-Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c11814</link>
      <description>Peng Zhang, Wenxiong Shi, Hua-Qing Yin, Bao-Qin Sun, Yu&#8208;Fei Song, Tong&#8208;Bu Lu, Zhiming Zhang, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415169242

                Syngas electrosynthesis stands as an energy-saving strategy for producing chemical raw materials, but it remains a great challenge in achieving a balance between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, a series of single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) were constructed by uniformly dispersing different polyoxometalates (POMs) into ZnAl-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) through a simple stripping self-assembly technique, forming single-sandwich-layer-based ZnAl-POM (POM = W10, PW12, and P2W18) with abundant oxygen vacancies and zinc vacancies. The well-defined monodispersed W10 clusters function as electron sponges for reversibly accepting and releasing electrons to boost the level of CO2 reduction. The ZnAl-W10-3 can efficiently adjust HER and CO2RR to achieve a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.9% for both H2 and CO production. A broad CO/H2 ratio (0.32-1.35) can be obtained over the optimized ZnAl-W10-3 within a wide potential window (-0.8 to -2.0 V vs RHE) via adjusting the W10 amount. Systematic investigations reveal that W10-mediated electron and proton transfer processes and abundant unsaturated sites in ultrathin ZnAl-LDH significantly enhance the tunability of the CO2RR and HER activities.</description>

      <title>Catalysts for Electrochemical Oxidation of Ammonia: A Comprehensive Review of Fundamentals and Optimization Strategies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202509364</link>

                Abstract The realization of a hydrogen (H 2 ) economy confronts formidable challenges in storage, transportation, and logistics. To address these challenges, H 2 carriers have been proposed as alternative solutions. Ammonia (NH 3 ), as one of the most promising H 2 carriers, becomes a game&#8208;changer, offering higher volumetric H 2 density than compressed H 2 , simplified logistics, and compatibility with existing infrastructure, which thereby reduces costs and supply chain complexities. However, fully realizing NH 3 &#8217;s potential requires overcoming downstream inefficiencies associated with its conversion either back into H 2 or into energy. Downstream processes primarily include thermal cracking, NH 3 electrolysis, and direct NH 3 fuel cells, two of which are electrochemical systems leveraging the NH 3 oxidation reaction (AOR). The efficiency of these electrochemical systems is significantly limited by severe surface poisoning and poor AOR catalytic activity, underscoring the urgent need for advanced catalyst design. Here, a comprehensive review of AOR electrocatalysis is provided, with a focus on mechanistic insights into activity&#8208;governing steps and surface poisoning pathways. Recent advances in catalyst design are summarized, and overlooked factors are highlighted for performance enhancement. Finally, perspectives on future research directions are presented for AOR catalyst development to accelerate the integration of NH 3 &#8208;based technologies into the hydrogen economy.</description>

                Abstract Although molecular cocatalysts (MCs) have demonstrated significant application potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, the immobilization and stabilization of them for long&#8208;term application remains challenging. Herein, an integrated photoanode (BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 ) is developed by immobilizing Co 4 O 4 cubanes onto NH 2 &#8208;MIL&#8208;88B(Fe) (NM88B(Fe)) decorated BiVO 4 via site&#8208;isolation strategy. The unoccupied coordination sites in NM88B(Fe) covalently bound to both Co 4 O 4 and BiVO 4 , which significantly decreases the interfacial charge transfer resistance of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 and achieve prolonged stability. More importantly, the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 remarkably lowered the energy barrier and thermodynamically favored surface water oxidation. Consequently, the photocurrent density of BiVO 4 @NM88B(Fe)/Co 4 O 4 photoanode achieved up to 5.26 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V RHE , which is 3.73 times higher than that of bare BiVO 4 . This work presents a site&#8208;isolation strategy to overcome molecular catalyst stabilization challenges in PEC systems while offering crucial insights into designing efficient charge transfer channels between OECs and semiconductors for enhanced water splitting performance.</description>

                Abstract Rational design of high&#8208;entropy intermetallic compounds (HEICs) remains challenging due to complex structure&#8208;property relationships and the lack of predictive tools. Here, a data&#8208;driven framework is presented to evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of L1 2 &#8208;type quinary Pt 3 M(4) HEICs, where M comprises any four elements from six 3 d transition metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn). Guided by the Pm&#8208;3m space group, 15 distinct compositions with numerous microstates are designed. A deep neural network, trained on 453 computed datasets, predicts hydrogen adsorption energy (&#8710; E H* ) across 20 000 microstructures per composition, enabling statistical mapping of site&#8208;specific performance. To capture the effect of local atomic environments, a novel statistical evaluation approach is introduced that quantifies the number of microstates falling within the optimal &#8710; E H* range, advancing beyond conventional mean&#8208;based evaluations. Among all candidates, Pt 3 (CrMnFeCo) emerges as the most promising HER catalyst, validated experimentally over a wide pH range. Further in&#8208;depth data mining reveals that surface Co, Cr, and Fe optimize Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;M sites, while subsurface Ni and Co modulate Pt&#8208;Pt&#8208;Pt interactions. This study establishes a new paradigm for HEIC catalyst design and deepens the mechanistic understanding of activity origin in complex multimetal systems.</description>

                With the growing demand for realistic representations of chemical structures and the advent of exascale computing, the intelligent sampling of potential energy surfaces and efficient identification of global minima have become more essential but also more feasible. Building on prior studies demonstrating the efficiency of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) swarm intelligence algorithm, we report a hybrid metaheuristic framework that integrates the adaptive exploration capabilities of ABC coupled with the exploitation strengths of genetic algorithms (GA) in a scalable, Python-based implementation. The resulting tool, RANGE (Robust Adaptive Nature-inspired Global Explorer), provides seamless interfaces to multiple potential energy evaluators, either directly or via widely used Python libraries, and is designed for high-performance computing environments. We describe the implementation details of RANGE and evaluate its performance, relative to ABC- or GA-alone based algorithms, on a variety of chemical systems, including molecular clusters and heterogeneous surfaces. Our results demonstrate RANGE&#8217;s efficiency, robustness, and broad applicability in addressing challenging global optimization problems in computational chemistry and materials science.</description>

                Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a vapor-phase thin-film deposition technique offering precise atomic-scale control over film thickness and conformality. Widely used across diverse fields including microelectronics, energy storage, and biomaterials, traditional optimization of ALD processes typically relies on trial-and-error experimentation or computational simulations. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods have emerged as powerful tools to significantly accelerate and improve ALD process optimization, material discovery, and fundamental understanding of ALD chemistry. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the intersection of ALD and AI/ML, examining their roles in process optimization, new material development, reaction mechanism exploration, and the application of advanced algorithms, including large language models. Additionally, we introduce a bibliometric approach to systematically collect and analyze relevant scientific literature. Finally, we outline existing challenges and provide insights into the future potential of integrating AI with ALD to drive further innovation in materials science and engineering.</description>

                Catalysts operate under complex conditions that require sophisticated approaches to understand their dynamics. This perspective outlines advances in experimental operando techniques, theoretical approaches, and machine learning (ML)-based data analysis to elucidate catalyst dynamics and improve the next-generation catalyst design. We first survey operando techniques, spanning electron microscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy, that capture catalyst dynamics under operating conditions. We then discuss how operando observations integrate with and inform theoretical models, creating an iterative feedback loop between experiment and computation. Finally, we highlight how advanced data analysis, especially ML, enables the interpretation of high-dimensional operando data sets and can even inform catalyst design. Together, these synergetic approaches provide a unified framework for probing catalyst function and accelerating the rational design of efficient, durable catalytic systems for sustainable chemical manufacturing.</description>

                Fouling and corrosion are critical challenges in heat transfer equipment. This study developed nickel-tungsten (Ni-W) composite coatings reinforced with micro- and nano-graphene (Gr) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (Ni-W/Gr and Ni-W/GrPTFE) to enhance resistance to fouling and corrosion. The Ni-W/GrPTFE superhydrophobic coating exhibited a significantly greater water contact angle (152.1&#176;) compared to bare Q235 carbon steel (90.1&#176;) and a notably lower surface free energy of 3.48 mJ/m2, compared to 31.36 mJ/m2 for bare Q235 carbon steel. Surface roughness, chemical composition, and micromorphology were analyzed using atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results revealed superior corrosion resistance for the Ni-W/GrPTFE coating, with a minimal corrosion current density of 2.25 &#215; 10&#8722;5 &#181;A/cm2, a higher impedance modulus of 8.8 &#215; 104 &#937;&#183;cm2 at low frequencies, and substantial charge transfer resistance of 5.49 &#215; 104 &#937;&#183;cm2. Tafel polarization further confirmed a lower corrosion rate of 2.12x10&#8722;3 mm/a. Furthermore, fouling tests at various temperatures showed that the Ni-W/GrPTFE coating achieved a 90.74% fouling inhibition rate. Additionally, self-cleaning tests confirmed the absence of surface contaminants. These results indicate that the Ni-W/GrPTFE composite superhydrophobic coating offers exceptional durability, making it a promising solution for harsh conditions in heat transfer systems, geothermal applications, and chemical industries.</description>

      <title>Cavity&#8208;Networked Copper Nanocatalysts with Acid&#8208;Tolerant Microenvironments for Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>

                Abstract Gasophilic/hydrophobic microstructured Cu nanomaterials address the multi&#8208;carbon (C 2+ ) selectivity bottleneck in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), yet their morphological control is hindered by low reduction potentials and high surface atomic mobility. This study reports a bioinspired gas&#8208;trapping hydrophobic Cu nanostructure (BGH&#8208;Cu) via in situ electrochemical reconstruction, forming an interconnected cavity network that confers gasophilic/hydrophobic properties. Mechanistic studies reveal cavities act as dynamic electrolyte reservoirs, selectively retaining OH &#8722; /K + to suppress proton transport and create a local micro&#8208;alkaline environment, while cavity&#8208;enhanced cation enrichment synergizes with C&#9472;C coupling. BGH&#8208;Cu achieves C 2 H 4 Faradaic efficiency of 54.7% at current density of 600 mA cm &#8722;2 in strongly acidic conditions (pH 1), with 63.7% single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency and 40 h stability in a membrane electrode assembly configuration. This work provides a non&#8208;extreme synthesis strategy for gasophilic/hydrophobic Cu nanomaterials, elucidates the &#8220;cavity microenvironment modulation&#8221; mechanism for C 2+ selectivity, and offers a new paradigm for high&#8208;current&#8208;density acidic CO 2 RR to C 2+ products.</description>

      <title>Locking the Lattice Oxygen in Commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for High Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Efficient and sustainable hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) requires the development of robust low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. A robust acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is fabricated, featuring single Co atoms incorporated into commercial RuO 2 (Co SA /RuO 2 ) and demonstrate that the Co sites suppress the mobility of lattice oxygen in commercial RuO 2 , thereby eliminating the stability&#8208;limited lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism and improving the catalyst stability. The theoretical calculations reveal that the atomically dispersed Co sites shifts the &#949;d&#8208;dn of RuO 2 downward, optimizing the adsorption of O * and * OOH, thereby changing the rate&#8208;determining step and improving the catalytic performance. In addition, atomically dispersed Co enhances the strength of the Ru&#8211;O lattice interaction, thereby alleviating the dissolution of Ru and effectively improving the stability of the catalyst under OER conditions. Specifically, the Co SA /RuO 2 &#8208;promoted PEMWE requires a voltage of 1.662 V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm &#8722;2 and can be stably performed for &gt;550 h at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 with negligible performance decay. Thus, this work paves the way for the fabrication of highly active and stable ruthenium oxide&#8211;based OER catalysts and their use as alternatives to the costly Ir&#8208;based counterparts.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion (ECC) offers a promising route to reduce CO 2 emissions and to store renewable electricity in the form of chemical fuels. To date, ECC has been mainly based on pure CO 2 gas isolated from carbon capture solutions, which is an energy&#8208;intensive step. Recently, direct CO 2 conversion from a capture solution, which enables integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, has attracted attention because it can eliminate the energy&#8208;intensive CO 2 isolation step. In addition, producing concentrated gas products in integrated systems reduces the cost for downstream separation. This review discusses the key aspects of integrated CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion systems, including direct air capture (DAC), the chemistry of CO 2 capture and release, electrode designs and system configurations, as well as technoeconomic viability. First, the fundamental concepts and chemistry of CO 2 capture and in situ CO 2 release in electrochemical reactors are summarized. Then, recent advancements in integrated systems are discussed, covering both system configurations and electrode designs. Potential avenues for enhancing product selectivity toward high&#8208;value chemicals, such as ethylene and ethanol, as well as lowering operating cell voltages and improving the economic viability of integrated systems, are highlighted. Finally, major technical and economic challenges as well as emerging research opportunities in the domain of integrated CO 2 capture and conversion are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Scalable Kernel Density Approach for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Atomistic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c02595</link>

                Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on k-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional data sets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in (i) chemistry, (ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), (iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and (iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.</description>
