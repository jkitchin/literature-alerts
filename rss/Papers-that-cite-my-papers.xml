      <title>Exploring the Conformational Space of a Sulfonyl-Based Ionic Liquid on Platinum-Based Mono and Bimetallic Surfaces</title>

                Understanding the arrangement of ionic liquids at the interface and their interactions with the surface is crucial for enhancing selectivity in heterogeneous reactions for practical applications. In this study, we investigate the nature of the adsorption and structural orientations of a sulfonyl-based ionic liquid on platinum-based mono- and bimetallic (111) surfaces employing replica exchange molecular dynamics and first-principles density functional theory calculations. More than 30 confirmations of the ionic liquid are identified on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. In addition to adsorption energies, factors such as dynamics of ionic liquids, molecule-surface distances, and charge transfer analyses are found to be important indicators for understanding adsorption phenomena. The sulfonyl anion exhibits contrasting behavior on the two surfaces, showing a preference for chemisorption on the monometallic surface, while the pyrrolidinium cation is physisorbed on both metal surfaces. Both metal surfaces are negatively charged primarily because of charge transfer from the sulfonyl anion. The analysis of the orientational preference reveals a nearly flat orientation of the cation on the monometallic surface, while a tilted orientation is observed on the bimetallic surface.</description>

                Detailed atomic-scale understanding is a crucial prerequisite for rational design of next-generation single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the sub-&#229;ngstr&#246;m precision needed for systematic studies is challenging to achieve on common SACs. Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic system featuring Fe-N4 single-atom sites, where the metal-organic structure is modulated by 0.4 &#197; corrugation of an inert graphene/Ir(111) support. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we show that the support corrugation significantly affects the reactivity of the system, as the sites above the support "valleys" bind TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) significantly stronger than the sites above the "hills". The experimental temperature stability of TCNQ varies by more than 60 &#176;C, while computations indicate more than 0.3 eV variation of TCNQ adsorption energy across the Fe-N4 sites placed atop different regions of the corrugated graphene unit cell. The origin of this effect is steric hindrance, which plays a role whenever large molecules interact with neighboring single-atom catalyst sites or when multiple reactants coadsorb on such sites. Our work demonstrates that such effects can be quantitatively studied using model SAC systems supported on chemically inert and physically corrugated supports.</description>

                Magneto-ionics, which refers to the modification of the magnetic properties of materials through electric-field-induced ion migration, is emerging as one of the most promising methods to develop nonvolatile energy-efficient memory and spintronic and magnetoelectric devices. Herein, the controlled generation of ferromagnetism from paramagnetic Co&#8211;Ni oxide patterned microdisks (prepared upon thermal oxidation of metallic microdisks with dissimilar Co&#8211;Ni ratios, i.e., Ni25Co75 and Ni50Co50) is demonstrated under the action of voltage. The effect is related to the partial reduction of the oxide phases to their metallic forms. Samples richer in Co show stronger magneto-ionic activity, which manifests in lower-onset threshold voltages, faster switching rates, and larger values of the attained saturation magnetization. By means of scanning electron microscopy, a cobalt segregation phenomenon has been experimentally observed upon thermal oxidation, which has been theoretically discussed from the diffusivities' viewpoint. X-ray diffraction characterization has revealed transitions between purely mixed Ni and Co oxides, in the OFF state, to a mixture of oxide and metallic phases, in the ON state, because of the oxygen ion motion outward/inward the Co&#8211;Ni oxide microdisks, depending on the voltage polarity. Ab initio calculations reveal that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy migration is lower in CoO than in NiO, in agreement with the obtained magneto-ionic responses. The observation of magneto-ionic effects in patterned disks (and not only in archetypical continuous films) is a step further for the practical utilization of this phenomenon in real miniaturized devices.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have the potential to act as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts for the oxygen&#8208;redox reactions in metal&#8208;air batteries. However, achieving both high performance and stability in these SACs has been challenging. Here, a novel and facile synthesis method is used to create cobalt&#8208;doped&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon structures (Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) containing cobalt&#8208;SACs by carbonizing a modified ZIF&#8208;11. HAADF&#8208;STEM images and EXAFS spectra confirmed that the structure with the lowest cobalt concentration contains single cobalt atoms coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (Co&#8208;N&#8324;). Electrochemical tests showed that this electrocatalyst performed exceptionally well in both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (E1/2 &#8776; 0.859 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (Ej = 10: 1.544 V), with excellent stability. When used as a bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in the air cathode of a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB), a peak power density of 178.6.1 mW cm &#8722;2 , a specific capacity of 799 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 and a cycle&#8208;life of 1580 is achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the concentration and the position of the pyridinic nitrogen with Co play a critical role in determining the overpotential of this electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;redox reactions. The unprecedented performance of this electrocatalyst can bring paradigm changes in the practical realization and application of metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Atomic Adsorption Energies Prediction on Bimetallic Transition Metal Surfaces Using an Interpretable Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Density Functional Theory Approach</title>

                Abstract In this study, we identified features with the largest contributions and property trends in predicting the adsorption energies of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen adsorbates on transition metal (TM) surfaces by performing Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;based calculations and Machine Learning (ML) regression models. From 26 monometallic and 400 bimetallic fcc(111) TM surfaces obtained from Catalysis&#8208;hub.org, three datasets consisting of fourteen elemental, electronic, and structural properties were generated using DFT calculations, site calculations, and online databases. The number of features was reduced using feature selection and then finely&#8208;tuned random forest regression (RFR), gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were implemented for adsorption energy prediction. Finally, model&#8208;agnostic interpretation methods such as permutation feature importance (PFI) and shapely additive explanations (SHAP) provided rankings of feature contributions and directional trends. For all datasets, RFR and GPR demonstrated the highest prediction accuracies. In addition, interpretation methods demonstrated that the largest contributing features and directional trends in the regression models were consistent with structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships of TMs like the d&#8208;band model, the Friedel model, and higher&#8208;fold adsorption sites. Overall, this interpretable ML&#8211;DFT approach can be applied to TMs and their derivatives for atomic adsorption energy prediction and model explainability.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen plays a key role in maximizing the benefits of renewable energy, and the widespread adoption of water electrolyzers and fuel cells, which convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and electrical energy into each other, is strongly desired. Electrocatalysts used in these devices, typically in the form of nanoparticles, are crucial components because they significantly affect cell performance, but their raw materials rely on limited resources. In catalyst research, electrochemical experimental studies using model catalysts, such as single&#8208;crystal electrodes, have provided valuable information on reaction and degradation mechanisms, as well as catalyst development strategies aimed at overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and durability, across spatial scales ranging from the atomic to the nanoscale. Traditionally, these experiments are conducted using well&#8208;defined, simple model surfaces like bare single&#8208;crystal electrodes in pure systems. However, in recent years, experimental methods using more complex interfaces&#8212;while still precisely controlling elemental distribution, microstructure, and modification patterns&#8212;have been established. This paper reviews the history of those studies focusing on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions, which account for the majority of efficiency losses in fuel cells and water electrolyzers, respectively. Furthermore, potential future research themes in experimental studies using model electrodes are identified.</description>

      <title>Electronic descriptors for designing high-entropy alloy electrocatalysts by leveraging local chemical environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56421-9</link>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a vast compositional space for fine-tuning electrocatalytic activities, leveraging millions of distinct active sites on the surface. However, the intricate local chemical environment poses challenges to the rational and efficient design of HEA electrocatalysts with high reactivity. Here, focusing on noble-metal HEAs for oxygen reduction reactions, we propose a straightforward yet effective descriptor for quantitively determining the local reactivities of HEAs. This descriptor is based on a linear combination of the intrinsic d-band filling of the active center and the neighborhood electronegativity. Our model offers an accurate and robust description of the binding strengths of intermediates with different adsorption configurations on HEAs, supported by external density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the local environmental electronegativity of the HEA surface is strongly related to the d-band profile of the center atom(s) embedded within. Finally, we establish a library of activity maps for HEAs encompassing nine noble-metal elements, suggesting that Pd-rich and Ir-rich alloys, such as Pd&#8211;Ag, Ir&#8211;Pt, Ir&#8211;Au compositions, hold promise as potential candidates for optimal electrocatalysts. High entropy alloys hold promises for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction. Here, the authors develop a straightforward yet effective descriptor for rational designing high entropy alloy electrocatalysts with the aid of surface local chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Predicting electrocatalytic urea synthesis using a two-dimensional descriptor</title>

                Electrochemical synthesis routes powered by renewable electricity can provide sustainable chemical commodities by replacing conventional fossil-based processes. Increasing research focuses on value-added chemicals like the indispensable fertilizer urea, which also constitutes a study case for electrochemical CN-coupling. To guide the identification of highly selective catalysts, we aim to provide new insight by analysing existing experimental data on the selectivity of transition metal catalysts towards electrochemically synthesized urea. Firstly, we project high dimensional experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA) to lower dimensions, and thereby confirm that urea selectivity is correlated with the selectivity towards CO and NH3. Furthermore, we identified the most suitable two-dimensional descriptors for selectivity prediction out of various adsorption energies calculated using density functional theory (DFT). We suggest that the adsorption energies of *H and *O on transition metal slabs predict the selectivity towards urea in the co-reduction of CO2 and nitrite ( $${{\rm{NO}}}_{2}^{-}$$ ). Electrochemical synthesis routes powered by renewable electricity can provide sustainable chemical commodities by replacing conventional fossil-based processes. Here, the authors employ computational methods to provide new insight towards the identification of highly selective catalysts, by analysing existing experimental data on the selectivity of transition metal catalysts towards electrochemically synthesized urea.</description>

      <title>Breaking linear scaling relationships in oxygen evolution via dynamic structural regulation of active sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55150-9</link>
      <description>Zheye Zhang, Hongyan Zhao, Shibo Xi, Xiaoxu Zhao, Xiao Chi, Hong Bin Yang, Zhongxin Chen, Xiaojiang Yu, Yang&#8208;Gang Wang, Bin Liu, Peng Chen, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407087380

                The universal linear scaling relationships between the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates limit the performance of catalysts in multi-step catalytic reactions. Here, we show how these scaling relationships can be circumvented in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction by dynamic structural regulation of active sites. We construct a model Ni-Fe2 molecular catalyst via in situ electrochemical activation, which is able to deliver a notable intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity. Theoretical calculations and electrokinetic studies reveal that the dynamic evolution of Ni-adsorbate coordination driven by intramolecular proton transfer can effectively alter the electronic structure of the adjacent Fe active centre during the catalytic cycle. This dynamic dual-site cooperation simultaneously lowers the free energy change associated with O&#8211;H bond cleavage and O&#8211;O bond formation, thereby disrupting the inherent scaling relationship in oxygen evolution reaction. The present study not only advances the development of molecular water oxidation catalysts, but also provides an unconventional paradigm for breaking the linear scaling relationships in multi-intermediates involved catalysis. Circumventing linear scaling relationships in multi-step catalytic reactions is meaningful but challenging. Here, the authors report a method to break this scaling relationship in the oxygen evolution reaction through dynamic regulation of the active site in a Ni-Fe molecular complex catalyst.</description>

      <title>Bias Dependence of the Transition State of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most prominent electrocatalytic reactions of green energy transition. However, the kinetics across materials and electrolyte pH and the impact of hydrogen coverage at high current densities remain poorly understood. Here, we study the HER kinetics over a large set of nanoparticle catalysts in industrially relevant acidic and alkaline membrane electrode assemblies that are only operated with pure water humidified gases. We discover distinct kinetic fingerprints between the iron triad (Fe, Ni, Co), coinage (Au, Cu, Ag), and platinum group metals (Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh). Importantly, the applied bias changes not only the activation energy (EA) but also the pre-exponential factor (A). We interpret these changes as entropic changes in the interfacial solvent that differ between acid and base and entropic changes on the surface due to a changing hydrogen coverage. Finally, we observe that anions can induce Butler&#8211;Volmer behavior for the coinage metals in acid. Our results provide a new foundation to understand HER kinetics and, more broadly, highlight the pressing need to update common understanding of basic concepts in the field of electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) employing Ir/Ru&#8208;free anodes emerges as a bright prospect for green hydrogen society. Here, a Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 nanosheet electrocatalyst is reported, in situ grown on stainless&#8208;steel paper, as an efficient and durable self&#8208;supporting AEMWE anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interstitial [MnSe 4 ] tetrahedra elevate the Fermi level and narrows the band gap of the electrocatalyst, thereby expediting electrode reaction kinetics and increasing the electrical conductivity. In addition, the interstitial Mn atoms attenuate the electron density of Ni and Fe and motivate phase transition to actual active (Mn, Fe)&#8208;doped &#947; &#8208;NiOOH species. The downward d &#8208;band center of Ni active center facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting * OOH desorption step, refreshing the active center, and reducing the free energy barriers for OER. Accordingly, the Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 electrode achieves OER overpotentials of 149 and 232 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. The AEMWE cell incorporating Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 anode demonstrates high performance (1.0 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.68 V cell ) and durability (at 1 A cm &#8722;2 for 300 h), surpassing most AEMWE cells that use NiFe&#8208;based anodes. This work highlights the potential of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anodes for efficient and durable AEMWE.</description>

                Abstract Six types of M x Sb y compounds (Fe, Co, and Ni antimonides) are synthesized in form of mono&#8208;dispersed nanocrystallites (NCs) via a hot&#8208;injection metathesis&#8208;reduction. Various contents of Sb atoms are found to drive crystallographic structure and re&#8208;coordination in the M x Sb y materials, leading to rhythmical changes of orthorhombic M 3 Sb&#8594;hexagonal MSb&#8594;monoclinic (or orthorhombic) MSb 2 . The crystallography is identified as crucial factor in electrocatalysis of water splitting at cathodic and anodic electrodes, respectively. Owning to the in&#8208;plane microstrain distributed along (001) plane, the synthesized Ni 3 Sb NCs are more suitable to catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), sharing overpotential (&#951; 10 ) of 93 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 45 mV dec &#8722;1 , and extremely low hydrogen adsorption resistance (0.019 &#937;) is obtained. The orthorhombic FeSb 2 NCs featured with larger deprotonation capacity of 13.71 mC V &#8722;1 excelled in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrolysis, and is confirmed to facilitate minimal deformation of the OOH * . The integrated devices (FeSb 2 &#8214;Ni 3 Sb) are tested as efficient catalyst for overall water splitting (1.58 V@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with long stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidated the particular coordination of Sb with proper electronegativity (2.05) is able to adjust active sites, relax electronic attraction, and benefit electrochemical reactions.</description>

                Abstract An efficient approach for fabrication of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst is desirable for designing the energy storage and conversion devices in real&#8208;world usages due to low cost and excellent catalytic properties. The preparation of hollow carbon capsules (HCC) containing cobalt (Co)&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported by a simple synthesis process without using templates for the first time. Initially, cobalt phenylphosphonate (Co&#8208;MOF) nanorods are fabricated through a simple hydrothermal approach. The as&#8208;formed Co&#8208;MOF is covered with a thin coating of polydopamine (DP&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF) through chemical polymerization of dopamine in Tris&#8208;HCl (pH 8.5). The DP&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF is used as self&#8208;degraded template for the formation of HCC under pyrolysis. The formation mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of HCC are investigated. The hollow structure derived under N 2 exhibits a low overpotential (295 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with excellent stability (90.98%) for 150 h, which is further verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the designed anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer based on C&#9472;Co&#9472;N as cathode delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 (at 2.19 V) and 1000 mAcm &#8722;2 (at 2.33 V) in 1.0 m KOH at 60 &#176;C. The fabricated new Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is highly beneficial for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance AEMWEs.</description>

      <title>Continuous Electrochemical Carbon Capture via Redox-Mediated pH Swing&#9472;Experimental Performance and Process Modeling</title>

                We investigate a continuous electrochemical pH-swing method to capture CO2 from a gas phase. The electrochemical cell consists of a single cation-exchange membrane (CEM) and a recirculation of a mixture of salt and phenazine-based redox-active molecules. In the absorption compartment, this solution is saturated by CO2 from a mixed gas phase at high pH. In the electrochemical cell, pH is reduced, and CO2 is selectively released in a desorption step. We investigate the influence of redox molecule concentration on the charge storage capacity of the solution, as well as the impact of current density and solution recirculation rate on process performance. A theoretical framework, based on a minimal set of assumptions, is established. This framework describes the data very accurately and can be used for system design and optimization. We evaluate the trade-off between energy consumption and CO2 capture rate and compare with published reports. We report a low energy consumption of 32 kJ/mol of CO2 at a capture rate of 39 mmol/m2/min.</description>

      <title>A Vanadium Redox Flow Process for Carbon Capture and Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.4c00631</link>
      <description>Mohsen Afshari, Abdelrahman Refaie, Prince Aleta, Ahmad Hassan, Mohammad Rahimi, ACS ES&amp;T Engineering. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406934605

                Climate change mitigation by decreasing worldwide CO2 emissions is an urgent and demanding challenge that requires innovative technical solutions. This work, inspired by vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), introduces an integrated electrochemical process for carbon capture and energy storage. It utilizes established vanadium and ferricyanide redox couples for pH modulation for CO2 desorption and absorbent regeneration. The developed process consumes electricity during the daytime&#9472;when renewable electricity is available&#9472;to desorb CO2 and charge the cell, and it can regenerate the absorbent for further CO2 absorption while releasing electricity to the grid during nighttime when solar power is unavailable. This research explores the process fundamentals and scalability potential, through an extensive study of the system's thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics, and bench-scale operations. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to study the thermodynamics of the process, mapping the redox profiles to identify ideal potential windows for operation. The CV results indicated that an overpotential of approximately 0.3 V was required for driving redox reactions. Additionally, polarization studies were conducted to select the practical operating potential, identifying 0.5 V as optimal for the CO2 desorption cycle to provide sufficient polarity to overcome activation barriers in addition to the Nernstian potential. Mass transfer analysis balanced conductivity and desorption efficiency, with a 1:1 ratio identified as optimal for redox-active species and background electrolyte concentration. To further enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions, plasma treatment of electrode surfaces was implemented, resulting in a 43% decrease in charge transfer resistance, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Finally, a bench-scale operation of the system demonstrated an energy consumption of 54 kJ/mol CO2, which is competitive with other electrochemical carbon capture technologies. Besides its energy competitiveness, the process offers multiple additional advantages, including the elimination of precious metal electrodes, oxygen insensitivity in flue gas, scalability inspired by VRFB technology, and the unique ability to function as a battery during the absorbent regeneration process, enabling efficient day-night operation.</description>

      <title>Surface Structure Effects on H and O Adsorption on Gold, Nickel and Platinum Nanoparticles</title>

                Using quantum chemical modelling, in this work, we considered the structure effects determining the adsorption of H and O atoms on (111), (100), (110) and (211) surfaces of gold, nickel and platinum nanoparticles. Surface deformation enhanced the adatom bonding to active sites with a large coordination number on flat (111) and (100) surfaces, while no distinct tendency was observed on kinked (110) and (211) surfaces. The effect of the neighboring atoms depends on the coupling matrix element Vad2. For metals with a considerable matrix element, the adsorption energy decreases with the rise in coordination number, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Structure Prediction of Ionic Epitaxial Interfaces with Ogre Demonstrated for Colloidal Heterostructures of Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c12713</link>

                Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers exciting opportunities to create a wide variety of functional heterostructures. However, assessing structural compatibility&#9472;the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth&#9472;is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters and crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end, we implemented developments tailored for the high-efficiency prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include the use of pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and the use of a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically calculated based on the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for perovskite-based CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in excellent agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Finally, combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface, and to assign a structure to several other reported metal halide- and oxide-based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</description>
