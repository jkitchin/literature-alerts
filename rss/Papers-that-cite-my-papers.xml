                The effective separation of charge carriers and the redox capacity for water splitting are two crucial factors that influence photocatalysis. Here, we studied the photocatalytic properties of GaS/WTe2 van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) using first-principle calculations. The results show that this heterostructure acts as a direct Z-scheme with GaS as the water oxidation photocatalyst and WTe2 as the water reduction photocatalyst. Photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated, with electrons in GaS combining with holes in WTe2, while other charge carriers with high redox ability remain in the respective materials for water splitting. More importantly, the heterostructure exhibits excellent performance in all acid and alkali solutions (pH 0&#8211;14) and has strong light absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible region. The power conversion efficiency(PCE) reaches 19.73%. This work reveals that GaS/WTe2 heterostructure is a highly promising material for photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Mastering the Lattice Strain in Bismuth&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Conversion</title>

                Abstract Tuning the lattice strain of catalysts represents a powerful strategy to alter their electronic structures and ultimately regulate catalytic performance. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a promising avenue to accomplish the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle, however, there still lacks a distinct and systematic understanding of the lattice strain effect in CO 2 electrochemical conversion. In this work, the influence of lattice strain on Bi (012) facets to formate production is studied. The pre&#8208;executed density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that lattice compression promotes the wrinkling of exposed Bi surface and increases the total density of state (DOS) of active sites at the Fermi level. As the gradual intensification of lattice contraction, the selectivity of CO 2 reduction exhibits a volcanic alteration, with an optimal lattice contraction of 3%. Experimentally synthesized Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 /Bi heterogeneous catalyst confirms the effect of lattice compression. When compression reaches &#8722;3.04% on Bi (012) facets, the catalyst possesses the highest Faraday efficiency (FE) of 96.17% at &#8722;1.2 V RHE and an industrially scalable current density of &#8722;600 mA cm &#8722;2 . Additionally, in seawater&#8208;based electrolysis, the catalyst also exhibits excellent remarkable FE of 95.43% of formate production.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the synergistic effect of amorphous CoW-phospho-borides for overall alkaline water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.090</link>
      <description>Aniruddha Bhide, Suraj Gupta, Rinkoo Bhabal, Kishan H. Mali, B.R. Bhagat, Alpa Dashora, Maulik Patel, R. Fernandes, N. Patel, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 63(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393137824

                Amorphous transition-metal-phospho-borides (TMPBs) are emerging as a new class of hybrid bifunctional catalysts for water-splitting. The present work reports the discovery of CoWPB as a new promising material that adds to the smaller family of TMPBs. The optimized compositions, namely Co4WPB5 and Co2WPB1 could achieve 10 mA/cm2 at just 72 mV and 262 mV of overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the catalyst showed good performance in a 2-electrode assembly (1.59 V for 10 mA/cm2) with considerable stability (70 h stability, 10,000 operating cycles). Detailed morphological and electrochemical characterizations unveiled insights into the role of all elements in catalyst's improved performance. The presence of W was found to be crucial in improving the electronic conductivity and charge redistribution, making CoWPB suitable for both HER and OER. In computational simulation analysis, two configurations with different atomic environments, namely, CoWPBH and CoWPBO were found to have the lowest calculated overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. It was found that the surface P-sites in CoWPBH were HER-active while the Co-sites in CoWPBO were OER-active sites. The study presents new knowledge about active sites in such multi-component catalysts that will foster more advancement in the area of water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Investigation of Ammonia Oxidation on the M-Doped &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Fe) Surfaces</title>

                The ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) has applications as a sustainable energy source and in wastewater remediation. Nickel based catalysts for the AOR reaction are ideal as they are cost efficient, have longer lifetimes than more expensive alternatives, and can produce value-added products. Dopants can be applied to these nickel catalysts to further increase their value. This work explores the effects on reaction potentials when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 is doped with chromium, cobalt, copper, or iron using density functional theory to model the AOR. Limiting potentials for dinitrogen production improved when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 was doped with chromium and cobalt. Limiting potentials for nitrite production remained consistent when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 was doped with cobalt or iron. Compared with the pristine &#946;-Ni(OH)2 surface, there was no improvement in the limiting potential of nitrate formation for any of the doped surfaces. This research begins to reveal the importance of exploring dopant addition to &#946;-Ni(OH)2 as a method of improving the catalyst activity for the AOR.</description>

      <title>Toward transferable empirical valence bonds: Making classical force fields reactive</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0196952</link>
      <description>Alice Allen, G&#225;bor C&#347;anyi, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393152642

                The empirical valence bond technique allows classical force fields to model reactive processes. However, parametrization from experimental data or quantum mechanical calculations is required for each reaction present in the simulation. We show that the parameters present in the empirical valence bond method can be predicted using a neural network model and the SMILES strings describing a reaction. This removes the need for quantum calculations in the parametrization of the empirical valence bond technique. In doing so, we have taken the first steps toward defining a new procedure for enabling reactive atomistic simulations. This procedure would allow researchers to use existing classical force fields for reactive simulations, without performing additional quantum mechanical calculations.</description>

      <title>Role of Electrolyte pH on Water Oxidation for Iridium Oxides</title>

                Understanding the effect of noncovalent interactions of intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface on water oxidation kinetics is key for designing more active and stable electrocatalysts. Here, we combine operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to probe the effect of noncovalent interactions on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Our results suggest that the active species for the OER (Ir4.x+&#8211;*O) binds much stronger in alkaline compared with acid at low coverage, while the repulsive interactions between these species are higher in alkaline electrolytes. These differences are attributed to the larger fraction of water within the cation hydration shell at the interface in alkaline electrolytes compared to acidic electrolytes, which can stabilize oxygenated intermediates and facilitate long-range interactions between them. Quantitative analysis of the state energetics shows that although the *O intermediates bind more strongly than optimal in alkaline electrolytes, the larger repulsive interaction between them results in a significant weakening of *O binding with increasing coverage, leading to similar energetics of active states in acid and alkaline at OER-relevant potentials. By directly probing the electrochemical interface with complementary spectroscopic techniques, our work goes beyond conventional computational descriptors of the OER activity to explain the experimentally observed OER kinetics of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Extending the definition of atomic basis sets to atoms with fractional nuclear charge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0196383</link>
      <description>Giorgio Domenichini, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393152656

                Alchemical transformations showed that perturbation theory can be applied also to changes in the atomic nuclear charges of a molecule. The alchemical path that connects two different chemical species involves the conceptualization of a non-physical system in which an atom possess a non-integer nuclear charge. A correct quantum mechanical treatment of these systems is limited by the fact that finite size atomic basis sets do not define exponents and contraction coefficients for fractional charge atoms. This paper proposes a solution to this problem and shows that a smooth interpolation of the atomic orbital coefficients and exponents across the periodic table is a convenient way to produce accurate alchemical predictions, even using small size basis sets.</description>

      <title>Surface structure determination by exhaustive search of asymmetric unit</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.109.115430</link>
      <description>Xingxing Dong, Caiyun He, Chao He, Hui Wang, Shaogang Xu, Hu Xu, Physical review. 109(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393157853

                Determining surface structures is a substantial challenge due to the limitations of experimental techniques and the complexity of theoretical models. In this work, we use a method called the exhaustive search of asymmetric unit (ESAU), designed to identify surface structures through a detailed analysis of the asymmetric unit. This method employs two main strategies: narrowing the research area by focusing on a smaller, unique segment rather than the entire unit cell, and transforming the infinite possibilities of atomic positions into discrete, manageable units. These strategies allow us to systematically enumerate all potential surface structures. Employing the ESAU method, we have successfully replicated a variety of known surface structures, including two-dimensional materials on substrates, and have also uncovered some previously unknown structures. Importantly, the ESAU method shows significant promise not only in utilizing experimental data but also in predicting surface and crystal structures without prior experimental evidence. Our results affirm that the ESAU approach provides a comprehensive and efficient tool for uncovering material structures, paving the way for more in-depth studies on the properties and behaviors of materials.</description>
