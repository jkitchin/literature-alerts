      <title>Toward data-driven predictive modeling of electrocatalyst stability and surface reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0271797</link>
      <description>Jiayu Peng, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412726279

                Catalyst dissolution and surface restructuring are ubiquitous in electrocatalysis, often leading to formidable activity&#8211;stability trade-offs and obscure electrochemically induced surface species that severely hinder the understanding and optimization of electrocatalysts under diverse harsh operating conditions. As even state-of-the-art characterization techniques lack the resolution and efficiency for the unambiguous elucidation of decomposition kinetics and reconstruction dynamics at electrocatalytic interfaces, many atomistic modeling approaches&#8212;following the recent advances in physics-driven machine learning&#8212;have been widely used to facilitate the atom-by-atom understanding and rational engineering of electrocatalyst stability and dynamics. This Perspective systematically assesses classical and data-driven approaches in theoretical surface science and computational catalysis, recognizing their achievements and highlighting their limitations in throughput, efficiency, accuracy, bias, transferability, and scalability toward enabling realistic and predictive modeling of electrocatalyst degradation and reconstruction. By examining different methods spanning first-principle simulations, surface sampling, neural network interatomic potentials, and generative deep learning models, it is underscored how such data-driven computational techniques help elucidate the precise nature of various key interfacial atomistic processes to address existing technical challenges in surface modeling and provide a new paradigm to optimize dissolution kinetics and restructuring dynamics for electrocatalyst design.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Microscopy of Individual Pt&#8211;Rh Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles during Competing Oxidation and Alloying</title>

                The surface chemical composition of supported single Pt-Rh core-shell nanoparticles was studied to understand the Rh behavior in oxidizing and reducing gas environments using spectro-microscopy with high spatial resolution. We combined in situ X-ray photoemission electron microscopy with ex situ scanning electron-, atomic force-, and scanning Auger-microscopy to distinguish Rh oxidation-reduction, dewetting-sintering, and alloying-segregation during the course of the experiment. A more than 20% higher Rh 3d5/2 oxide to metal photoemission intensity ratio for the Rh layer on top of the Pt-core was found as compared to the bare strontium titanate (STO) oxide catalyst support in close vicinity, where Rh/RhOx nanoparticles are forming. At elevated temperatures, Rh diffuses into the Pt particle, and this alloying at the Pt metal surface competes with Rh oxidation, whereas the Rh/RhOx nanoparticles on the STO support are observed to sinter under identical oxidizing and temperature environments. A nanoparticle facet-dependent analysis of selected Pt-core nanoparticles suggests that Rh oxidation is most advanced on a small nanoparticle with a low coordination top facet that we indexed by electron backscatter diffraction, demonstrating the strength of our correlative approach.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Accelerated Computational Screening of Pt-Modified Cantor Alloys as High-Entropy Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44210-025-00063-5</link>

                Abstract High-entropy alloys are increasingly recognised as promising catalyst materials due to their highly tunable compositions. In particular, the Cantor alloy, CrCoFeMnNi, has attracted significant interest as a low-cost, earth-abundant alternative to Pt-group catalysts. However, the Cantor alloy is susceptible to degradation in acidic environments. To address this, Pt has been proposed as an addition to the Cantor alloy to leverage the high catalytic activity and surface stability of Pt. In this study, we identify and elucidate the catalytic activity trend for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by screening CrCoFeMnNiPt alloys containing 50&#8211;100 at.% Pt and up to 50 at.% of each 3d element at 10 at.% resolution using a purely computational, machine learning-accelerated density-functional-theory workflow. Assuming the formation of a Pt skin through surface reconfiguration, a machine learning-accelerated simulation protocol infers the strain-corrected adsorption strengths of key reaction intermediates and uses them as descriptors for kinetic modelling. Our results show that Pt-modification of the Cantor alloy is a potentially viable strategy towards active and durable ORR catalysts. However, the simulations also predict binary Pt-rich alloys with approximately 80 at.% Pt to exhibit the highest ORR activity due to synergistic ligand and strain effects. As this model identifies known alloys with high ORR performance, we suggest that this framework contributes to a clear understanding of how bulk composition affects the reaction kinetics of complex surface alloys.</description>

                The urgent demand for Pt-free oxygen reduction catalysts drives exploration of tungsten-based alternatives, motivated by its Pt-mimetic valence electron configuration and optimal oxygen binding energy (&#916;EO &#8776; - 2.05 eV) revealed in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) volcano plots. Herein, a hierarchical W3N4-doped catalyst has been engineered through dual-stage thermal activation of covalent triazine framework (CTF)-tungstate complexes, where W precursors serve dual roles as self-sacrificing templates and active site generators. In-depth discussions via distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis elucidates that the hierarchical pore structure and active sites of WNNP-C demonstrate &#8764;90% reduction in relaxation time (&#964; = 0.18 vs 1.6 s of WNOSAC-C) at half potential and achieve a 0.83 V half-wave potential (E1/2) approaching Pt/C (0.865 V) in 0.1 M KOH coupled with exceptional methanol tolerance. The mechanistic analysis demonstrates that the enhanced electrical conductivity of the catalyst support facilitates the desorption of *OH intermediates by overcoming their elevated energy barrier, which preferentially promotes the 4e- ORR pathway and consequently improves the overall ORR performance. Moreover, the WNNP-C assembled zinc-air battery delivers 839 mAh gZn-1 specific capacity and over 140 h of stability at a discharge current density of 5 mA/cm2, validating the strategy's effectiveness in synchronizing porous architectures with W3N4 active centers. This work provides a paradigm for unlocking catalytic potential in traditionally inert transition metals through synergistic coordination pyrolysis engineering.</description>

                The conversion of CO2 to value-added compounds is an important part of the effort to store and reuse atmospheric CO2 emissions. Here, we focus on CO2 hydrogenation over so-called inverse catalysts: transition metal oxide clusters supported on metal surfaces. The conventional approach for computational screening of such candidate catalyst materials involves a reliance on density functional theory (DFT) to obtain accurate adsorption energies at a significant computational cost. Here, we present a machine learning (ML)-accelerated workflow for obtaining adsorption energies at the metal&#8211;oxide interface. We enumerate possible binding sites at the clusters and use DFT to sample a subset of these with diverse local adsorbate environments. The dataset is used to explore interpretable and black-box ML models with the aim of revealing the electronic and structural factors controlling adsorption at metal&#8211;oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the explored ML models can be used for low-cost prediction of adsorption energies on structures outside of the original training dataset. The workflow presented here, along with the insights into trends in adsorption energies at metal&#8211;oxide interfaces, will be useful for identifying active sites, predicting parameters required for microkinetic modeling of reactions on complex catalyst materials, and accelerating data-driven catalyst design.</description>

                Abstract The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) represents an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to the traditional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for industrial ammonia synthesis. However, the cleavage of the strong N&#8801;N bond hinders the practical application of NRR. Herein, an innovative design strategy is proposed based on a Fe 76 Si 8 B 13 Nb 3 metallic glass (MG&#8208;FeSiBNb) catalyst, featuring a unique amorphous structure with endogenous nanoscale compositional heterogeneity. This catalyst achieves an impressive ammonia yield rate of 92.1 &#181;g h &#8722;1 mg &#8722;1 cat. in 0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 solution, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NRR electrocatalysts. Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis reveals that MG&#8208;FeSiBNb provides abundant unsaturated coordination sites, essential for effective N 2 adsorption. Furthermore, electronic structural characterizations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Si, B, and Nb atoms into the Fe&#8208;based matrix precisely tailors the local electronic environment, effectively shifting the Fe d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level. This electronic modulation enhances electron transfer efficiency, thus promoting the hydrogenation of * NH 2 to * NH 3 . Additionally, the amorphous nature of MG&#8208;FeSiBNb suppresses hydrogen adsorption by eliminating well&#8208;defined crystal facets, thereby selectively mitigating the hydrogen evolution reaction and enhancing NRR selectivity. This work offers not only a high&#8208;performing NRR catalyst but also a generalizable strategy for sustainable electrocatalysis beyond conventional crystalline systems.</description>

                Abstract Structurally ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) have garnered increased attention due to their unique physicochemical properties. The ordered atomic configuration and compositional diversity of HEIs contribute to optimal active&#8208;site isolation, broad tunability of catalytic activity, and remarkable electrochemical stability. These advantages have enabled HEIs to achieve exceptional catalytic performance in various energy&#8208;related applications, positioning them as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation catalytic materials. However, comprehensive reviews on HEIs are scarce. This work provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HEIs research, encompassing innovative synthesis strategies, advanced characterization techniques, and catalytic applications such as the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction, and small&#8208;molecule oxidation reactions. Furthermore, the unique catalytic properties of HEIs are thoroughly elucidated, while discussing the challenges and future research opportunities for HEI&#8208;based catalysts. This work highlights the transformative potential of HEIs in driving the development of energy&#8208;related catalytic technologies and provides valuable insights for designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance catalysts.</description>

                Heterostructuring nanocrystals into a modular metal-semiconductor configuration enables tunable and novel functionalities. Such combinations at the nanoscale equip hybrid structures with unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties unobserved in single-phase materials. Here, we report the hot-injection synthesis of Pd-Cu3Pd13S6.65Te0.35 nanoheterostructures (NHCs) from PdCu nanoalloy seeds. First, the growth of Pd-rich chalcogenide nanocrystals was initiated over the preformed PdCu surface through simultaneous sulfidation and tellurization, followed by their transformation into Pd-Cu3Pd13S6.65Te0.35 NHCs. By strategically employing moderate-temperature annealing, we achieved the complete migration of Cu+ due to the higher reactivity of Cu in comparison to Pd at that temperature, establishing a novel mechanistic relationship between cation mobility and temperature. This strategy enables controlled semiconductor domain formation and targeted metal migration. The NHCs showed efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution with low Tafel values in acidic media, outperforming conventional nanoelectrocatalysts. Computational analysis identified the active sites responsible for the observed catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Progress in Interdisciplinary Research: Evidence From the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

                Although the COVID-19 pandemic has largely subsided, it remains crucial to reflect on past experiences and shortcomings to better prepare for potential future outbreaks. Effective outbreak management is a complex scientific challenge that demands robust interdisciplinary collaboration. However, there is currently a lack of quantitative and objective assessments of progress in interdisciplinary research on coronaviruses, particularly measures that directly evaluate the extent of such collaborations. In this study, we employed Python-based algorithms to analyze 156,674 publications from the Web of Science database, tracing the development of coronavirus research and interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings reveal a significant upward trend in both the volume of coronavirus research and the intensity of interdisciplinary collaboration over the past 5 decades. Notably, major outbreaks have acted as critical catalysts, driving substantial advancements in this field. The past 2 decades, marked by three major coronavirus outbreaks, have seen dramatic growth in the scale and depth of interdisciplinary studies. Nevertheless, achieving seamless cross-disciplinary integration remains a persistent challenge. This study offers valuable insights for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and optimizing academic discipline structures in universities.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Induced Degradation of Short-Chain PFAS by Noble Metal Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c01683</link>
      <description>Samir Kumar Nayak, Khushboo Bhardwaj, Pramod Kumar Verma, Sharma S. R. K. C. Yamijala, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412786954

                Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used in industry and consumer products due to their unique physical and chemical properties. However, due to their toxicity and environmental persistence, the production of long-chain PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been systematically phased out. Instead, short-chain PFAS have been widely used as replacements for long-chain PFAS. However, recent studies indicate that even short-chain PFAS can be toxic to the environment. Despite numerous attempts, complete degradation of these short-chain PFAS has not yet been achieved, leaving room for further exploration. In this work, we explored the potential of plasmonic silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoclusters (NCs) in the complete degradation of short-chain PFAS. By considering icosahedral Ag55 and Au55 NCs, as well as different types of PFAS, we present a thorough study of plasmon-induced processes for NC-PFAS complexes. Among different decay channels, our study focuses on plasmon decay through the direct hot electron transfer (DHET) and direct hot hole transfer (DHHT) pathways from NC to PFAS. Our calculations reveal that DHET is more probable in Ag-PFAS complexes and DHHT is more probable in Au-PFAS complexes. Furthermore, among all complexes, the Ag-PFBS complex exhibits the highest DHET with a total probability of 10%. Our Ehrenfest molecular dynamics simulations show that the PFAS in Ag-PFAS complexes undergo efficient degradation in the presence of these hot carriers, albeit at different rates.</description>

      <title>MS25: Materials Science-Focused Benchmark Data Set for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c01262</link>
      <description>Tristan Maxson, Ademola Soyemi, Xinglong Zhang, Benjamin W. J. Chen, Tibor Szilv&#225;si, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412789389

                We present MS25, a benchmark data set for evaluating machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) across diverse materials-relevant systems including MgO surfaces, liquid water, zeolites, a catalytic Pt surface reaction, high-entropy alloys (HEAs), and disordered Zr-oxides. Five MLIP architectures (MACE, NequIP, Allegro, MTP, and Torch-ANI) are trained and tested, focusing not only on traditional metrics (energies, forces, and stresses) but also explicitly validating derived physical observables such as lattice constants, volumes, and reaction barriers. We find that most models reach comparable accuracy on standard error metrics across the simple systems, although equivariant MLIPs offer 1.5-2&#215; improvements over nonequivariant MLIPs in energy and force error for structurally complex or compositionally disordered environments such as HEAs and Zr-O systems. Our analysis highlights that low errors in energy and force predictions do not guarantee reliable observables, emphasizing the necessity of explicit validation. We demonstrate limitations in cross-framework transferability, as models trained on one zeolite framework (CHA) fail to reliably generalize to predictions of structurally distinct frameworks (e.g., MFI). Size-extensive tests show some dependence on system size for MgO, resulting from forced periodicity. The HEA and Zr-O data sets are identified as challenging tests for future benchmarks and MLIP model architecture developments as they show significant differentiation in error between MLIP architectures and are still relatively difficult at 1000 training images. Moving forward, we recommend that benchmarking efforts shift their focus from marginal accuracy improvements in energy and force errors toward identifying and understanding model failure modes, rigorously assessing transferability, and evaluating how their errors affect observable predictions. For researchers looking to choose an MLIP architecture, we suggest selecting equivariant MLIP architectures if the complexity of the system is a challenge. For simple materials problems, auxiliary features such as integration with molecular dynamics engines, trade-offs between computational data set generation cost vs MLIP inference speed, and framework integration may play a more important decision factor than small differences in error metrics that are unlikely to matter for production-level research.</description>

      <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Oxygen Reduction on Pt@Ni Cones via Concentrated Electric and Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202500684</link>
      <description>Guojun Han, Mohamed Ait Tamerd, Ling Gao, Guo Qingsheng, Cong Feng, Menghao Yang, Guo&#8208;Xing Miao, Jing Fu, Small Methods. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412812727

                Abstract Efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for energy conversion technologies, yet its sluggish kinetics remain a significant challenge. Beyond optimizing the catalyst's intrinsic properties, field effects can also profoundly impact the microenvironment at the catalyst/electrolyte interface, thereby affecting electrocatalytic performance. This study explores the tip&#8208;enhanced ORR by leveraging the coupled effects of electric and magnetic fields at the reaction interface. The Pt&#8208;loaded ferromagnetic Ni cone electrode generates strong localized electric fields that reorganize interfacial water molecules into a more ordered structure. This strengthens hydrogen bonding between the electrolyte and reaction intermediates, which in turn facilitates proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and accelerates the rate&#8208;limiting *OH desorption into interfacial water matrix. Additionally, the amplified electric fields at tips accelerate OH &#8722; electromigration away from the catalyst surface, while the migration current couples with the concentrated magnetic fields near tips to drive strong magnetohydrodynamic flows. These intensified flows effectively enhance O 2 molecule delivery to wider electrode surface and facilitate better OH &#8722; product removal, thus improving the overall reaction efficiency. This strategy of concentrating both E/M fields using the field&#8208;effect catalyst optimizes the ORR kinetics at the interface as well as the mass transport dynamics near interface, offering an effective approach for advancing ORR performance.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Amorphous Ni Core&#8211;N&#8208;Doped Carbon Shell Nanoparticles for Efficient Bifunctional Water Splitting</title>

      <description>Haoran Cheng, Hong Seok Kim, Energy &amp; environment materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412812879

                Amorphous metal&#8208;based catalysts are highly promising for water splitting due to their abundance of unsaturated active sites. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, surfactant&#8208;free synthesis of amorphous nickel nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon shells (A&#8208;Ni@NC) via pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL). The synergistic integration of the amorphous Ni core and a defect&#8208;rich N&#8208;doped carbon shell markedly enhanced the catalytic activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with low overpotentials of 182 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH. Furthermore, the bifunctional catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.63 V and retained 98.9% of its initial performance after 100 h of operation. The nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon shell not only offered abundant active sites and structural protection but also promoted charge transport. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that N&#8208;doping optimized intermediate adsorption energies, while the amorphous Ni core facilitated efficient electron transfer. This green and scalable synthesis strategy provides a promising platform for developing a wide range of transition metal@N&#8208;doped carbon hybrid catalysts for sustainable energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction of PtRhNiMoPd Nanocrystals Facilitates Hydrogen Evolution from Acidic Electrolytic Water</title>

                The development and design of Pt-based alloy catalysts with high activity and stability are important for the hydrogen evolution reaction, especially in acidic media. Here, we report a mild acid-impregnated reconfiguration strategy to construct defects and strain effect (PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80&#176;C-6h) by removing unstable Ni atoms in acetic acid treatment. Only 5.6 mV is required to achieve a current density of -10 mA cm-2 for PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80&#176;C-6h in an acid electrolyte. Meanwhile, PtRhNiMoPd NCs-80&#176;C-6h exhibits negligible degradation after 10,000 cycles, which is superior to commercial Pt/C. This suggests that surface reconstruction can expose more efficient active sites and improve the adsorption of intermediates on the active sites, enhancing the catalytic performance. This study provides a new perspective for the rational design of high-entropy alloy nanomaterials with an efficient hydrogen evolution performance.</description>

      <title>Redox chemistry meets semiconductor defect physics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0270226</link>
      <description>Jian Gu, Jun Huang, Jun Cheng, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(5)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412824011

                Understanding how the electronic structure of electrodes influences electrocatalytic reactions has been a longstanding topic in the electrochemistry community, with predominant attention paid to metallic electrodes. In this work, we present a defect physics perspective on the effect of semiconductor band structure on electrochemical redox reactions. Specifically, the Haldane&#8211;Anderson model, originally developed to study multiple charge states of transition-metal defects in semiconductors, is extended to describe electrochemical redox reactions by incorporating the solvent effect, inspired by the Holstein model. The solvent coordinate and the actual charge on the redox species in reduced and oxidized states are assumed to be in instant equilibrium, and the transitions between these states are defined by the framework of Green&#8217;s function. With these treatments, the charge state transitions are handled in a self-consistent manner, and the implications of charge self-consistency (or, equivalently, charge self-regulation) on electrocatalysis can be investigated explicitly. We first confirm that this self-consistent approach is essential to accurately depict the hybridization effect of band structure by comparing the model-calculated ionization potential and electron affinity, as well as the redox potential of the species, with those obtained from density functional theory calculations. Next, we illustrate that the effect of charge self-consistency is key to obtaining a fuller understanding of the catalytic activities of semiconductor electrodes and the source of asymmetry in reorganization energies, which is often observed in prior ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, we discuss how band structure impacts redox reactions in the strong coupling limit. Finally, we compare our work with other relevant studies in the literature.</description>

                Hydrogen is a green and sustainable energy vector that can facilitate the large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy, renewable fuels for heavy transport, and deep decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries. Anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (AEM-WEs) have several achieved or expected competitive advantages over other electrolysis technologies, including the use of precious metal-free electrocatalysts at both electrodes, fluorine-free hydrocarbon-based ionomeric membranes and bipolar plates based on inexpensive materials. Contrasting the analogous proton-exchange-membrane system (PEM-WE), where pure water is circulated (no support electrolyte), the current generation of AEM-WEs necessitates the circulation of a dilute aqueous alkaline electrolyte for reaching high energy efficiency and durability. For several reasons, including but not limited to lower cost of balance-of-plant, lower operating cost and improved device's lifetime, achieving high cell efficiency and performance using an alkali-free water feed is highly desirable. In this review, we develop and build a foundational understanding of AEM-WEs operating with pure water, as well as discuss the effects of operating with natural water feeds like seawater. After a discussion of the possible advantages of pure-water-fed AEM-WEs, we cover the thermodynamic and kinetic processes involved in AEM-WE, followed by a detailed review of materials and components and their integration in the device. We highlight the influence of electrolyte composition and alkali/electrolyte-free feed on the membrane-electrode assembly, ionomers, electrocatalysts, porous transport layer, bipolar plates and operating configuration. We provide evidence for how the pure water feed engenders several issues related to the degradation of device components and propose mitigation strategies.</description>

                Abstract The pursuit of low&#8208;cost, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline media is vital for water&#8208;splitting applications. Herein, the hydrothermal&#8208;based synthesis of a multiphase ferromagnetic catalyst CoFeP, comprising FeP, CoP, and Fe 2 P is reported. Structural analyses confirm the coexistence of phases, and electrochemical studies reveal excellent OER activity. CoFeP exhibits an overpotential of 335 mV at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 116 mV dec &#8722;1 without a magnetic field, whereas under the magnetic field of 2000 G, these values lowered to 235 mV and 93 mV dec &#8722;1 , respectively. The enhancement is attributed to magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced spin polarization, surface reconstruction, and increased ECSA from 70 to 110 mF cm &#8722;2 , highlighting the potential of magnetic modulation for boosting catalytic performance. Through spin&#8208;polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations, the structural and electronic features of CoFeP, providing theoretical insights into its role in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is elucidated. This investigation demonstrates that the application of an external magnetic field significantly reduces the overpotential required for OER as the adsorption of intermediate species becomes stronger due to more charge transfer, aligning with experimental observations. These findings highlight the interplay between magnetic fields and electrocatalytic performance, offering a pathway to enhance energy conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Empirical Energy Functions Using Physics&#8208; and Machine Learning&#8208;Based Extensions: Structure, Dynamics and Spectroscopy of Modified Benzenes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.70162</link>
      <description>Kham Lek Chaton, Markus Meuwly, Journal of Computational Chemistry. 46(21)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412861632

                The effects of replacing individual contributions to an empirical energy function are assessed for halogenated benzenes (X-Bz, X = H, F, Cl, Br) and chlorinated phenols (Cl-PhOH). Introducing electrostatic models based on minimal distributed charges (MDCM) instead of usual atom-centered point charges (PCs) to realistically describe features such as &#963;-holes yields overestimated hydration free energies unless the van der Waals parameters are reparametrized. Scaling van der Waals ranges by 10% to 20% for three Cl-PhOH and most X-Bz yield results within experimental error bars, which is encouraging, whereas for benzene (H-Bz) PC-based models are sufficient. Replacing the bonded terms by a neural network-trained energy function featuring fluctuating atom-centered PCs also yields qualitatively correct hydration free energies, which can be brought into agreement with experiments within error bars after adaptation of the van der Waals parameters. The infrared spectroscopy of Cl-PhOH is rather well captured by all models, although the ML-based energy function performs somewhat better in the region of the framework modes. The present work finds that refinements of empirical energy functions for targeted applications are a meaningful way toward more quantitative and physics-based simulations. At the same time, empirical energy functions have matured to a remarkable degree, at least for the species considered in the present work.</description>

      <title>A sustainable Ru catalyzed aerobic oxidation based on high loading magnetic ionic nanoparticles network</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-07505-5</link>
      <description>Sepideh Asgari, Mina Ghahremani, Sepideh Najafvand-Derikvandi, Hesamodin Moradi, Mina Tavakolian, Fariborz Mansouri, Babak Karimi, Scientific Reports. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412867463

                In this study, we describe the production of a novel high loading magnetic ionic nanoparticle network (HMINN) encompassing a functionalized imidazolium structure bridging between the core-shell magnetic nanoparticles. The network was constructed through the in situ radical polymerization of tris-vinyl imidazolium moieties on the surface of mercaptopropyl functionalized silica-coated magnetite. The structural and chemical features of the resulting material were comprehensively characterized utilizing various analytical methods such as N2 adsorption-desorption, FTIR, TGA, HRTEM, ICP, XPS, VSM and elemental analysis. This material was then served to produce a Ru-supported catalyst for the oxidation of alcohols and amines under aerobic conditions. The aerobic oxidation of a diverse variety of benzylic, aliphatic, allylic, cyclic, and heterocyclic substrates was efficiently accomplished in the presence of Ru@HMINN under additive-free conditions and excellent E-factor and EcoScale factor, affording good to excellent yields of the related aldehydes and nitriles. Some of the advantages are the highly available active sites, high ionic density and porous high loading network, the outstanding dispersion of the catalyst in organic media, and the superior ability of imidazolium units to stabilize the Ru nanoparticles while allowing convenient separation of the whole system by applying an external magnet.</description>

                Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the latest stable release of the graphics processing units molecular dynamics (GPUMD) package, GPUMD 4.0. We begin with a brief review of its development history, starting from the initial version. We then discuss the theoretical foundations for the development of the GPUMD package, including the formulations of the interatomic force, virial and heat current for many&#8208;body potentials, the development of the highly efficient and flexible neuroevolution potential (NEP) method, the supported integrators and related operations, the various physical properties that can be calculated on the fly, and the GPUMD ecosystem. After presenting these functionalities, we review a range of applications enabled by GPUMD, particularly in combination with the NEP approach. Finally, we outline possible future development directions for GPUMD.</description>

                Being a program written primarily in Python that strictly adheres to modern object-oriented software engineering and parallel programming practices, VeloxChem is shown to be suitable for the development of (semi)automatized workflows that extend its scope from first-principles quantum chemical purism to hybrid quantum-classical interoperability and some degree of semiempiricism. Methods are presented for building complex systems such as metal-organic frameworks, constructing molecular mechanics and interpolation mechanics force fields, conformer searches, system solvation, determining free energies of solvation, and determining free energy profiles of reaction pathways using the empirical valence bond method. The implementations are made intuitive with opportunities for interactive plotting and 3D molecular structure illustrations through the use of Jupyter notebooks.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer driven by renewable electricity has been regarded as a sustainable energy production technology, but is greatly limited by the high cost and unsatisfactory durability of noble metal catalysts. Here, we present the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of the amplified intermetal bias in PtRh alloy nanolayer to promote the intrinsic catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction and the lifespan of the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Both experimental and theoretical results revealed the key role of the intermetal bias between Pt and Rh amplified by the rectifying contact with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons support in accelerating the pre&#8208;enrichment of protons on Rh sites, diffusion of H species from Rh to Pt sites, and final H dissociation from Pt sites. Consequently, the optimized Pt 3 Rh 2 /NC cathode with the most pronounced intermetal bias gives a record&#8208;high mass activity of 282 A mg Pt+Rh &#8722;1 at a cell voltage of 1.8 V in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Moreover, the Pt 3 Rh 2 /NC cathode can reduce the proton diffusion resistance from 0.95 &#937; of Pt/C to 0.69 &#937; at a cell voltage of 1.5 V due to the promoted hydrogen species diffusion on catalyst surface, largely decreasing the cell voltage and extending the lifespan by 3.2 times.</description>

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) offers a cost&#8208;effective and efficient platform for hydrogen production by enabling the use of non&#8208;platinum group metal (non&#8208;PGM) electrode materials. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key challenge. In this study, a CoMo&#8208;LDH OER electrode for AEMWE is developed via a sacrificial template strategy. The high valence state of Mo promotes oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing OER performance. Electrochemical reconstruction also induces a phase transition into active (oxy)hydroxide species during OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the weak OH &#8722; adsorption energy of CoMo&#8208;LDH lowers the energy barrier for OH &#8722; deprotonation, improving catalytic activity. The CoMo&#8208;LDH electrode demonstrates superior performance in AEMWE compared to the PGM&#8208;based IrO 2 electrode. This study highlights the potential of sacrificial template&#8208;based electrodes for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.</description>

                Abstract NH3 is the most basic raw material in industrial and agricultural production, and it is also an excellent hydrogen carrier, which plays a vital role in the global economy. NH3 synthesis usually adopts the traditional Haber-Bosch method, which not only consumes a lot of energy but also causes damage to the ecological environment. Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) can produce NH3 at normal temperature and pressure, so it has attracted a lot of attention. In this study, density functional theory was used to calculate the NRR catalytic mechanism and electrocatalytic performance of graphene-supported triatomic metal clusters. The results showed that VMn2@Gra has potential as an NRR catalyst, and the lowest energy barrier simulated was 0.56 eV. Through the analysis of electronic properties, it was found that there was charge transfer between metal and N atom, which further promoted the catalytic process. This study promotes the application of triatomic cluster catalysts in the field of NRR, and these findings provide a new understanding of the theory and experiment of new cluster catalytic systems.</description>

                Zusammenfassung Lichtschaltbare unnat&#252;rliche Aminos&#228;uren (lsUAs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Entwicklung von lichtsensitiven Enzymen, was erhebliches Potenzial f&#252;r vielf&#228;ltige Anwendungen wie Biotherapie und Biokatalyse birgt. Neben einer nahezu quantitativen lichtinduzierten Schaltung bestimmen vor allem das Interaktionspotenzial mit dem Enzym, die thermische Stabilit&#228;t und die effektive Belichtungswellenl&#228;nge den Erfolg und die Eignung einer lsUA f&#252;r eine bestimmte Anwendung. Um eine hohe Vielseitigkeit im aktuell verf&#252;gbaren Repertoire zu etablieren, wurden sechs lsUAs auf Basis von Azobenzol, Arylazopyrazol, Arylazothiazol, Hemithioindigo und Spiropyran entworfen und synthetisiert. Die resultierenden lsUAs weisen ein erweitertes Interaktionspotenzial auf, das auf ihre F&#228;higkeit zur Ausbildung von Wasserstoffbr&#252;ckenbindungen, ionischen Wechselwirkungen und Metallionenkoordination zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist. Dar&#252;ber hinaus zeigen die lsUAs unterschiedliche photochemische Eigenschaften, wobei vier von ihnen ausschlie&#223;lich mit sichtbarem Licht reversibel zwischen den Isomeren schalten. F&#252;r f&#252;nf der sechs lsUAs konnten jeweils orthogonale Aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA&#8208;Synthetasen identifiziert werden, die den co&#8208;translationalen Einbau in ein Protein erm&#246;glichen. Zus&#228;tzlich dazu wurden die Wechselwirkungen zwischen der Synthetase und der lsUA computergest&#252;tzt analysiert. Schlie&#223;lich wurde das photochemische Verhalten der f&#252;nf lsUAs in einem enzymatischen Modellsystem validiert, wobei deren Eignung zur lichtgesteuerten Regulation enzymatischer Aktivit&#228;t best&#228;tigt werden konnte. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die signifikante Erweiterung des lsUA&#8208;Repertoires und demonstrieren dessen Anwendbarkeit f&#252;r die gezielte Modulation enzymatischer Aktivit&#228;t.</description>

                Abstract Photoswitchable unnatural amino acids (psUAAs) play a crucial role in the engineering of light&#8208;sensitivity in enzymes, which holds significant promise for diverse applications such as biotherapy and biocatalysis. Besides near&#8208;quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co&#8208;translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase&#8208;psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds substantial promise for effectively utilizing renewable energy to produce green hydrogen. However, it faces critical durability challenges due to acid&#8208;driven catalyst degradation under intermittent renewable power. Here, this study reports a dynamic dissolution&#8208;deposition equilibrium that achieves exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) stability through rational design of a high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;derived architecture. Dealloying FeCoNiNbPt HEA creates a porous scaffold with dual&#8208;functional components: an amorphous NbOx buffer suppressing metal dissolution, while multicomponent Pt 3 (FeCoNi) nanocrystals synergistically enhancing HER activity (137 mV@1 A cm &#8722;2 , 2.5 &#215; lower than Pt/C) that thermodynamically favors redeposition. This dynamic self&#8208;adaptive mechanism maintains equilibrium under harsh operating conditions, demonstrating exceptional durability (&gt;2200 h @1 A cm &#8722;2 and 1 000 000 cycles). The self&#8208;supported catalysts can be easily mass&#8208;produced with 8.87 wt.% Pt loading (60% reduction vs Pt/C), indicating its industrial applicability. The equilibrium&#8208;driven design paradigm opens new avenues for industrial proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane devices operating under fluctuating power.</description>

      <title>Dual Active Site Engineering of Nickel Selenides by a Substrate Effect for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202501326</link>

                Developing efficient catalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires rapid water/hydrogen adsorption/dissociation kinetics. However, challenges remain in reducing energy barriers by simultaneously activating the anionic and cationic sites in a single compound. In this article, a heterogeneous substrate (NiS 2 &#8208;NiS) regulatory strategy is developed to construct dual active sites in NiSe 2 toward the HER. The obtained NiSe 2 /NiS 2 &#8208;NiS electrode delivers excellent catalytic performance, achieving an overpotential of 46 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the NiS 2 &#8208;NiS heterogeneous substrate induces charge distribution and activates Ni 3d electrons. Combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis, the Ni and Se atoms, as the dual active site for the HER, possess the minimum water adsorption&#8211;dissociation energy barrier and the optimal hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, respectively. This finding provides novel insights into the dual active site engineering for highly efficient catalysts based on the substrate effect.</description>

      <title>Heterointerface Anchored Ir with Localized Strong Orbital Coupling for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202509985</link>

                Abstract The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface&#8208;engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb&#8208;TiO 2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic&#8208;scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir&#9472;O support bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity&#8208;stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrO x /m&#8208;Nb&#8208;TiO 2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 ), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72 V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm &#8722;2 , coupled with unprecedented durability with &lt;1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.</description>

      <title>C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; Fullerene as the Active Site for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>

                Abstract Fullerene (C 60 ) was considered as a catalyst promoter in various electrochemical reactions, yet its catalytic role in enhancing catalytic performance beyond electron transfer remains a puzzle to chemists. Traditional simulations imply C 60 &#8217;s inertness in CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) due to weak interaction with COOH* intermediates. Here, according to a pH&#8208;field coupled microkinetic model at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we demonstrate that C 60 acts as molecular active sites to facilitate the CO 2 RR toward CO through a strong binding to COOH* in the electrochemical conditions. This binding is mainly due to the unique structure of C 60 that induces large dipole moment changes to stabilize COOH* intermediates across different pH conditions. By detailed comparison of experimental CO 2 RR observations and quantitative pH&#8208;dependent modeling, this work provides new insights on C 60 &#8208;based catalysts, highlighting the large dipole moment change upon adsorption at curved surfaces should not be dismissed when analyzing the pH&#8208;dependent binding strength and electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the role of Fe and Ni in oxygen evolution reaction on pentlandite using three generations of computational surface models</title>

                Abstract Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) &#8211; 2H2O &#8594; O2 + 4H+ + 4e&#8722; &#8211; remains the primary bottleneck in electrochemical water splitting for green hydrogen production. Pentlandite, a bimetallic chalcogenide mineral, has recently shown promise under alkaline conditions, although the elementary processes at the atomic level remain largely unclear. Using density functional theory calculations, we report three generations of pentlandite surface models with varying complexity to decipher the contributions of Fe and Ni sites to OER activity. The first-generation model is based on the pristine pentlandite surface and purports that no OER catalytic activity is observed. The second-generation model takes surface coverage by adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl into account and suggests that Fe corresponds to the active site in the OER. In contrast, the third-generation model considers not only the surface coverage but also the surface oxidation of pentlandite by exchanging lattice sulfur atoms with oxygen, as observed experimentally. Only this extension shows that both Fe and Ni sites are active centers for OER and that Fe and Ni exhibit distinct limiting steps depending on applied bias, as determined by a degree of span control analysis. Our results demonstrate that when assessing pentlandite with regard to OER, surface oxidation and coverage effects must be explicitly considered in addition to the mechanistic breadth. The reported modeling approach provides the basis for the rational design of next-generation catalysts by highlighting the importance of considering surface oxidation in the theoretical description of energy conversion processes.</description>

      <title>Mapping uncertainty using differentiable programming</title>

                Abstract Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and propagation is a ubiquitous challenge in science, permeating our field in a general fashion, and its importance cannot be overstated. Recently, the commoditization of differentiable programming, motivated by the development of machine learning, has allowed easier access to tools for evaluating derivatives of complex systems, of implicit and nonlinear nature. Motivated by this, we develop a UQ mapping approach based on differentiable programming principles. The approach is novel, faster, and yields equally accurate results when compared against the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches for the UQ problem, which is to quantify and map uncertainty using linear methods or expensive Monte Carlo simulations. Three case studies&#8212;namely a continuous stirred tank reactor, a membrane reactor, and a fed&#8208;batch bioreactor&#8212;are assessed and compared against typical uncertainty mapping techniques. Lastly, the method allows the use of a single model implementation to perform forward and inverse uncertainty maps, easily switching mapping directions.</description>
