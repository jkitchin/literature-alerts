      <title>Elucidating the Proton Source for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electro-Reduction on Cu(100) Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory</title>

                The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu surfaces. However, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source remain elusive. While density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the GGA level have been widely used, they struggle to accurately describe adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. Here, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed surface water acts as the proton source for *CO reduction to *COH over a broad potential range via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation and consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potentials within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These insights illustrate a pronounced divergence between RPA and DFT-GGA results. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO2RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies on electrochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Phase Engineering Modulates the Electronic Structure of the IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable Water Splitting</title>

                The engineering of dual-functional catalytic systems capable of driving complete water dissociation in acidic environments represents a critical requirement for advancing proton exchange membrane electrolyzer technology, yet significant challenges remain. In this work, we investigate an IrO2/MoS2/CNT heterostructure catalyst demonstrating enhanced bifunctional performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. Strategic incorporation of IrO2 into the MoS2/CNT heterojunction induces a partial phase transformation from 2H to the metastable 1T configuration in MoS2, thereby modulating the electronic structure of IrO2 and improving the catalytic performance for overall water splitting. The optimized IrO2/MoS2/CNT catalyst exhibited exceptional overpotentials of 9 mV (HER) and 182 mV (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in acidic media. Full-cell evaluations further confirmed its practical potential, showing a 1.47 V operation voltage that outperforms standard Pt/C||IrO2 counterparts by 120 mV. The experimental results revealed that the n&#8211;n heterojunction between IrO2/CNT and MoS2/CNT generates a built-in electric field, enhancing charge redistribution and electron transport. Moreover, density functional theory simulations further identify iridium centers as dominant catalytic loci, with a metastable 1T-MoS2 phase mediating charge equilibration at atomic interfaces. This modification facilitates *OH adsorption and *OOH deprotonation and lowers the kinetic barrier during the water-splitting process.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-precision potentials for large-scale atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0245877</link>
      <description>David Immel, Ralf Drautz, Godehard Sutmann, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(11)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408672723

                Large-scale atomistic simulations rely on interatomic potentials, providing an efficient representation of atomic energies and forces. Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations, while traditional potentials provide a less precise but computationally much faster representation and, thus, allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential into a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large, complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but, in principle, a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces with a precision of 10 me V/&#197; and the ACE-energy exactly for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 &#215; 106 atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.</description>

      <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202500416</link>
      <description>Chunfeng Li, Danning Li, Lubing Li, Haozhou Yang, Yan Zhang, Jinzhan Su, Lei Wang, Bin Liu, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408674747

                Abstract Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64 V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm &#8722; 2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52 V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.</description>

      <title>Efficient exploration of reaction pathways using reaction databases and active learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0235715</link>
      <description>Domantas Kuryla, G&#225;bor C&#347;anyi, Adri C. T. van Duin, Angelos Michaelides, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(11)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408687121

                The fast and accurate simulation of chemical reactions is a major goal of computational chemistry. Recently, the pursuit of this goal has been aided by machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which provide energies and forces at quantum mechanical accuracy but at a fraction of the cost of the reference quantum mechanical calculations. Assembling the training set of relevant configurations is key to building the MLIP. Here, we demonstrate two approaches to training reactive MLIPs based on reaction pathway information. One approach exploits reaction datasets containing reactant, product, and transition state structures. Using an SN2 reaction dataset, we accurately locate reaction pathways and transition state geometries of up to 170 unseen reactions. In another approach, which does not depend on data availability, we present an efficient active learning procedure that yields an accurate MLIP and converged minimum energy path given only the reaction end point structures, avoiding quantum mechanics driven reaction pathway search at any stage of training set construction. We demonstrate this procedure on an SN2 reaction in the gas phase and with a small number of solvating water molecules, predicting reaction barriers within 20 meV of the reference quantum chemistry method. We then apply the active learning procedure on a more complex reaction involving a nucleophilic aromatic substitution and proton transfer, comparing the results against the reactive ReaxFF force field. Our active learning procedure, in addition to rapidly finding reaction paths for individual reactions, provides an approach to building large reaction path databases for training transferable reactive machine learning potentials.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Tri-Atomic Catalyst-Loaded Two-Dimensional Graphenylene for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15040296</link>

                As the energy crisis and environmental pollution continue to intensify, the demand for clean energy has increased. Using two-dimensional materials to catalyze overall water splitting is an important pathway for clean energy production. This study investigated the catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of tri-atomic clusters supported on a two-dimensional material, graphenylene (GPN). The structural stability of GPN was thoroughly investigated, and materials were employed as substrates to support a series of 28 distinct trimer clusters composed of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals. Ideal combinations of these systems were screened and designed. The loading configurations of TM3@GPN in two different systems were systematically studied. The stability of the catalyst was assessed by calculating the binding and cohesive energies and by performing molecular dynamics simulations, to confirm the catalyst stability. The optimal bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting were identified as Au3@GPN, Pt3@GPN, and Pd3@GPN, all of which demonstrated superior overall water splitting performance. As a novel two-dimensional material, biphenylene-based materials, when used to support metal clusters as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, represent an efficient and innovative approach.</description>

      <title>H&#8208;Embedding Induced Electron Localization in Pd Lattice for Improving Electrochemical Hydrogen Purification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202500249</link>

                Electrochemical hydrogen purification (EHP) technology with high-efficiency and easy-operation holds great potential in blended hydrogen transportation, which is currently restricted to proton exchange membrane system and Pt-based catalysts. As promising candidates used in alkaline anion exchange membrane system, Pd-based catalysts are hampered by the intense interaction between H* and delocalized 4d electrons, resulting in unsatisfactory catalytic activity. In this study, a marked enhancement of the alkaline membrane-based EHP performance is achieved, with hydrogen purity up to 99.96% separated from a CH4-H2 mixture, by strategically incorporating interstitial H atoms into Pd lattices for improving the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction. Detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations elucidate that the presence of interstitial H localizes free electrons into Pd-H covalent bonds, thereby weakening the interaction between surface-adsorbed H* and the catalytic surface. Moreover, operando spectroscopies and ab initio molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the enhanced interaction between the catalyst surface and interfacial water by electron delocalization, facilitates the desorption of H* to the interfacial water layer during catalysis. This research highlights the pivotal role of electronic localization in modulating the adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates for the design of efficient Pd-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Physical Significance of Descriptors to Predict the Band Center of High&#8208;Entropy Nanoalloys</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.70086</link>
      <description>Yu&#773;suke Nanba, Michihisa Koyama, Journal of Computational Chemistry. 46(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408748740

                ABSTRACT The band center of d orbitals ( d &#8208;band center) has been widely used as an effective descriptor for analyzing material properties. However, in high&#8208;entropy nanoalloys, the diverse atomic environments present challenges in systematically exploring all possible combinations. Due to computational resource limitations, generating a sufficient number of samples is infeasible. Consequently, the d &#8208;band center should be treated as a response variable in machine&#8208;learning models. We calculated the d &#8208;band center for individual atoms and applied supervised learning techniques to identify key factors influencing its behavior. While several factors were identified, their physical significance in predicting d &#8208;band centers remained unclear. To address this issue, we incorporated various interatomic distance terms as descriptors, along with element&#8208;based coordination numbers (ECN). The resulting model closely resembled the overlap integral of the Slater&#8208;type orbital, and the regression coefficients of the ECN exhibited sensitivity to the effective principal quantum number and nuclear charge. Understanding the physical significance of these descriptors is crucial for improving property predictions and facilitating data collection on novel materials.</description>

      <title>Spillover Dynamics in Heterogeneous Catalysis on Singe&#8208;Atom Alloys: A Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.70011</link>
      <description>Shuyu Lin, Rui Xiong, Jun Chen, Sen Lin, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews Computational Molecular Science. 15(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408778659

                ABSTRACT Recent advances in single&#8208;atom alloy ( SAA ) catalysts provide a unique platform for understanding spillover, due to the well&#8208;defined nature of the active site for dissociative chemisorption. In particular, the use of spilled adsorbates following molecular dissociation on the host metal surface facilitates the generation of high&#8208;value chemicals in subsequent catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, the factors that control the spillover process remain to be fully elucidated. This perspective discusses recent theoretical advances in the spillover dynamics on SAAs , with a particular focus on the dissociation and spillover processes of H 2 and CH 4 . It provides valuable insights into how various factors, such as energy transfer, nuclear quantum effects, gas&#8208;adsorbate interactions, and adsorbate size, impact the diffusion behavior of hydrogen and methyl species on SAA surfaces. The article concludes with a discussion of future prospects. This perspective underscores the significance of spillover dynamics in heterogeneous catalysis, with important implications for improving catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Improving the Catalytic Selectivity of Reverse Water&#8211;Gas Shift Reaction Catalyzed by Ru/CeO2 Through the Addition of Yttrium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15040301</link>
      <description>Alfredo Sol&#237;s-Garc&#237;a, Karina Portillo-Cortez, D. Dom&#237;nguez, S. Fuentes, J.N. D&#237;az de Le&#243;n, T.A. Zepeda, Uriel Caudillo&#8208;Flores, Catalysts. 15(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408778954

                This study reports the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of a series of catalysts of Ru supported on CeO2-Y2O3 composites (Ru/CeYX; X = 0, 33, 66, and 100 wt.% Y2O3) for CO2 hydrogenation. Supported material modification (Y2O3-CeO2), by the Y2O3 incorporation, allowed a change in selectivity from methane to RWGS of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. This change in selectivity is correlated with the variation in the physicochemical properties caused by Y2O3 addition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of crystalline fluorite-phase CeO2 and &#945;-Y2O3. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping revealed the formation of a homogeneous CeO2-Y2O3 nanocomposite. As the Y2O3 content increased, the specific surface area, measured by BET, showed a decreasing trend from 106.3 to 51.7 m2 g&#8722;1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Ce3d indicated a similar Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio across all CeO2-containing materials, while the O1s spectra showed a reduction in oxygen vacancies with increasing Y2O3 content, which is attributed to the decreased surface area upon composite formation. Catalytically, the addition of Y2O3 influenced both conversion and selectivity. CO2 conversion decreased with increasing Y2O3 content, with the lowest conversion observed for Ru/CeY100. Regarding selectivity, methane was the dominant product for Ru/CeY0 (pure CeO2), while CO was the main product for Ru/CeY33, Ru/CeY66, and Ru/CeY100, indicating a shift towards the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The highest RWGS reaction rate was observed with the Ru/CeY33 catalyst under all tested conditions. The observed differences in conversion and selectivity are attributed to a reduction in active sites due to the decrease in surface area and oxygen vacancies, both of which are important for CO2 adsorption. In order to verify the surface species catalytically active for RWGS, the samples were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy under reaction conditions.</description>

      <title>Sol&#8211;Gel-Synthesized Pt, Ni and Co-Based Electrocatalyst Effects of the Support Type, Characterization, and Possible Application in AEM-URFC</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/gels11040229</link>
      <description>Elitsa Petkucheva, Borislava Mladenova, Mohsin Muhyuddin, Mariela Dimitrova, G. Borisov, Carlo Santoro, E. Slavcheva, Gels. 11(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408793889

                This study explores the synthesis and characterization of platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co)-based electrocatalysts using the sol&#8211;gel method. The focus is on the effect of different support materials on the catalytic performance in alkaline media. The sol&#8211;gel technique enables the production of highly uniform electrocatalysts, supported on carbon-based substrates, metal oxides, and conductive polymers. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were used to analyze the structure of the synthesized materials, while their electrochemical properties, which are relevant to their application in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs), were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). This hydrogen energy-converting device integrates water electrolyzers and fuel cells into a single system, reducing weight, volume, and cost. However, their performance is constrained by the electrocatalyst&#8217;s oxygen bifunctional activity. To improve URFC efficiency, an ideal electrocatalyst should exhibit high oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) activity with a low bifunctionality index (BI). The present study evaluated the prepared electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium, finding that Pt25-Co75/XC72R and Pt75-Co25/N82 demonstrated promising bifunctional activity. The results suggest that these electrocatalysts are well-suited for both electrolysis and fuel cell operation in anion exchange membrane-unitized regenerative fuel cells (AEM-URFCs), contributing to improved round-trip efficiency.</description>

      <title>Entropy Engineering Activates Cu&#8208;Fe Inertia Center From Prussian Blue Analogs With Micro&#8208;Strains for Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cey2.693</link>
      <description>Han Man, Guanyu Chen, Fengmei Wang, Jiafeng Ruan, Yihao Liu, Yang Liu, Fang Fang, Renchao Che, Carbon Energy. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408806535

                ABSTRACT By the random distribution of metals in a single phase, entropy engineering is applied to construct dense neighboring active centers with diverse electronic and geometric structures, realizing the continuous optimization of multiple primary reactions for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many catalysts developed through entropy engineering have been built in nearly equimolar ratios to pursue high entropy, hindering the identification of the active sites and potentially diluting the concentration of real active sites while weakening their electronic interactions with reaction intermediates. Herein, this work proposes an entropy&#8208;engineering strategy in metal nanoparticle&#8208;embedded nitrogen carbon electrocatalysts, implemented by entropy&#8208;engineered Prussian blue analogs (PBA) as precursors to enhance the catalytic activity of primary Cu&#8208;Fe active sites. Through the introduction of the micro&#8208;strains driven by entropy engineering, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and geometric phase analysis (GPA) using Lorentz electron microscopy further elucidate the optimization of the adsorption/desorption of intermediates. Furthermore, the multi&#8208;dimensional morphology and the size diminishment of the nanocrystals serve to expand the electrochemical area, maximizing the catalytic activity for both ORR and OER. Notably, the Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with CuFeCoNiZn&#8208;NC operated for over 1300 h with negligible decay. This work presents a paradigm for the design of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with entropy engineering for multi&#8208;step reactions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Methanol Oxidation Catalysis by PtNi Nanowires with Controllable Element Distribution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c03303</link>

                Pt-based alloys with precisely controllable element distribution are highly sought after in catalysis. This study focuses on optimizing elemental distribution and alloying in PtNi alloy nanowires (NWs) through high-temperature heat treatment. The resulting PtNi alloy NWs with uniform elemental distribution (U-PtNi NWs) demonstrate exceptional stability, attributed to facilitated electron transfer and a denser Pt shell, in stark contrast to untreated NWs that suffer from elemental segregation and subsequent performance degradation during electrochemical testing. In methanol oxidation reaction tests, U-PtNi NWs demonstrated exceptional mass activity (1562.0 mA mg&#8211;1) and specific activity (5.38 mA cm&#8211;2), with minimal activity loss after 1000 cycles. This work emphasizes the significance of precise component control in developing high-performance catalysts and presents a strategy to enhance fuel cell performance through one-dimensional nanocomponent adjustment.</description>

                Renewable biomass serves as a cost-effective source of carbon matrix to carry single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the natural abundant oxygen in these materials hinders the sufficient dispersion of element with high oxygen affinity such iron (Fe). The lowered-density and oxidized SACs greatly limits their catalytic applications. Here we develop a facile continuous activation (CA) approach for synthesizing robust biomass-derived Fe-SACs. Comparing to the traditional pyrolysis method, the CA approach significantly increases the Fe loading density from 1.13 atoms nm&#8722;2 to 4.70 atoms nm&#8722;2. Simultaneously, the CA approach induces a distinct coordination tuning from dominated Fe-O to Fe-N moieties. We observe a pH-universal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance over the CA-derived Fe-SACs with a half-wave potential of 0.93 V and 0.78 V vs. RHE in alkaline and acidic electrolyte, respectively. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the increased Fe-N coordination effectively reduces the energy barriers for the ORR, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. The Fe-SACs-based zinc-air batteries show a specific capacity of 792 mA&#183;h&#183;gZn&#8722;1 and ultra-long life span of over 650 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. Developing efficient single-atom catalysts for clean energy technologies is still challenging. Here, the authors report a facile method to increase the density and tune the coordination of iron atom loaded in single-atom catalysts that boosts the activity for pH-universal oxygen electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Integrating Density Functional Theory Calculations and Machine Learning to Identify Conduction Band Minimum as a Descriptor for High-Efficiency Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysts in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

                Identifying efficient and physically meaningful descriptors is crucial for the rational design of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. In this study, we systematically investigate the HER activity of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning techniques. By exploring the relationship between key electronic properties, including the conduction band minimum (CBM), pz band center, and hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H), we establish a strong linear correlation between the CBM and &#916;G*H, identifying the CBM as a reliable and physically meaningful descriptor for HER activity. Furthermore, this correlation is validated in vacancy-defected TMD systems, demonstrating that the CBM remains an effective descriptor even in the presence of structural defects. To enable the rapid and accurate prediction of the CBM, we develop an interpretable three-dimensional model using the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) algorithm. The SISSO model achieves a high predictive accuracy, with correlation coefficients (r) and coefficients of determination (R2) reaching 0.98 and 0.97 in the training and 0.99 and 0.99 in the validation tests, respectively. This study provides an efficient computational framework that combines first-principles calculations and machine learning to accelerate the screening and design of high-performance TMD-based HER catalysts.</description>

      <description>Junsoo Park, Alex M. Ganose, Yi Xia, Applied Physics Reviews. 12(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408848753

                This is a review of theoretical and methodological development over the past decade pertaining to computational characterization of thermoelectric materials from first principles. Primary focus is on electronic and thermal transport in solids. Particular attention is given to the relationships between the various methods in terms of the theoretical hierarchy as well as the tradeoff of physical accuracy and computational efficiency of each. Further covered are up-and-coming methods for modeling defect formation and dopability, keys to realizing a material's thermoelectric potential. We present and discuss all these methods in close connection with parallel developments in high-throughput infrastructure and code implementation that enable large-scale computing and materials screening. In all, it is demonstrated that advances in computational tools are now ripe for efficient and accurate targeting of the needles in the haystack, which are &#8220;next-generation&#8221; thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of C(1s) binding energy shifts in amorphous carbon materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevmaterials.9.035601</link>

                The quantitative evaluation of the carbon hybridization state by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been a surface-analysis problem for the last three decades due to the challenges associated with the unambiguous identification of the characteristic binding energy values for sp2- and sp3-bonded carbon. Here, we computed the binding energy values of C(1s) core electrons on the absolute energy scale for model structures of amorphous carbon (a-C) using density functional theory (DFT). The DFT calculations show that in the case of hydrogen-free a-C, the C(1s) binding energy for sp3 carbon atoms is a distribution found approximately 1 eV higher than the binding energy distribution of sp2-hybridized carbons. However, the introduction of hydrogen in the a-C network reduces the distance between the characteristic signals of sp3- and sp2-bonded carbon due to the increased ability to screen the core hole by neighboring hydrogen atoms as compared to carbon atoms. This effect hinders the unambiguous quantification of the carbon hybridization state on the basis of C(1s) XPS data alone. This work can assist surface scientists in the use of XPS for the accurate characterization of carbon-based materials. Published by the American Physical Society 2025</description>

                Abstract Photoreforming of polylactic acid (PLA) waste into valuable chemicals offers a promising approach for environmental protection and waste valorization, yet faces challenges of low yields and harsh conditions. Herein, a Cd 0.5 Zn 0.5 S nanotwin catalyst decorated with Ru single atoms and clusters is reported, enabling selective photoreforming of PLA into pyruvic acid (PA) and H 2 . It is demonstrated that Ru single atoms favor PA formation via hydroxyl dissociation, while the further incorporation of Ru clusters serve as active sites for H 2 production. This synergistic effect significantly enhances photocatalytic performance, achieving 96.8% PA selectivity and efficient H 2 production with a record&#8208;breaking apparent quantum efficiency of 83.7% at 400 nm. This approach is scalable for outdoor processes, utilizing direct 1 m 2 sunlight irradiation to deliver &#8776;1191 mL h &#8722;1 of H 2 and 47.27 mmol h &#8722;1 of PA from PLA waste, paving a viable pathway for large&#8208;scale simultaneous production of high&#8208;value chemicals and H 2 .</description>

      <title>The Future of Catalysis: Applying Graph Neural Networks for Intelligent Catalyst Design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.70010</link>

                ABSTRACT With the increasing global demand for energy transition and environmental sustainability, catalysts play a vital role in mitigating global climate change, as they facilitate over 90% of chemical and material conversions. It is important to investigate the complex structures and properties of catalysts for enhanced performance, for which artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially graph neural networks (GNNs) could be useful. In this article, we explore the cutting&#8208;edge applications and future potential of GNNs in intelligent catalyst design. The fundamental theories of GNNs and their practical applications in catalytic material simulation and inverse design are first reviewed. We analyze the critical roles of GNNs in accelerating material screening, performance prediction, reaction pathway analysis, and mechanism modeling. By leveraging graph convolution techniques to accurately represent molecular structures, integrating symmetry constraints to ensure physical consistency, and applying generative models to efficiently explore the design space, these approaches work synergistically to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of catalyst design. Furthermore, we highlight high&#8208;quality databases crucial for catalysis research and explore the innovative application of GNNs in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and biocatalysis. In the end, we highlight key directions for advancing GNNs in catalysis: dynamic frameworks for real&#8208;time conditions, hierarchical models linking atomic details to catalyst features, multi&#8208;task networks for performance prediction, and interpretability mechanisms to reveal critical reaction pathways. We believe these advancements will significantly broaden the role of GNNs in catalysis science, paving the way for more efficient, accurate, and sustainable catalyst design methodologies.</description>

      <title>Iterative charge equilibration for fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0252566</link>
      <description>Emir Kocer, Andreas Singraber, Jonas A. Finkler, Philipp Misof, Tsz Wai Ko, Christoph Dellago, J&#246;rg Behler, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(12)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408831566

                Machine learning potentials allow performing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations, provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation machine learning potentials need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration step, but the direct solution of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size, making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl3 in water.</description>
