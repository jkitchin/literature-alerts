                To design new materials and understand their novel phenomena, it is imperative to predict the structure and properties of materials that often rely on first-principles theory. However, such methods are computationally demanding and limited to small systems. This topical review investigates machine learning (ML) approaches, specifically non-parametric sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR), to model the potential energy surface (PES) of materials, while starting from the basics of ML methods for a comprehensive review. SGPR can efficiently represent PES with minimal ab initio data, significantly reducing the computational costs by bypassing the need for inverting massive covariance matrices. SGPR rank reduction accelerates density functional theory calculations by orders of magnitude, enabling accelerated simulations. An optimal adaptive sampling algorithm is utilized for on-the-fly regression with molecular dynamics, extending to interatomic potentials through scalable SGPR formalism. Through merging quantum mechanics with ML methods, the universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential can create a digital-twin capable of predicting phenomena arising from static and dynamic changes as well as inherent and collective characteristics of materials. These techniques have been applied successfully to materials such as solid electrolytes, lithium-ion batteries, electrocatalysts, solar cells, and macromolecular systems, reproducing their structures, energetics, dynamics, properties, phase-changes, materials performance, and device efficiency. This review discusses the built-in library universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential, showcasing its applications and successes, offering insights into the development of future ML potentials and their applications in advanced materials, catering to both educational and expert readers.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic mechanism for overall water splitting to produce sustainable hydrogen by 2D Janus MoSH monolayer</title>

      <description>Deobrat Singh, Nisha Singh, Yogesh Sonvane, npj 2D Materials and Applications. 8(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404761563

                Abstract In the present work, we investigates the potential of two dimensional (2D) Janus MoSH monolayer as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting using first-principles calculations. Our results shows that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits excellent structural stability and electronic properties, which are essential for efficient electrocatalysis. We find that the charge transfer mechanism between Mo and S atoms plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer. Due to the asymmetric structure of MoSH monolayer, it has intrinsic electric field with dipole moment of 0.24 D. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential 0.04 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential 0.11 V, making it a promising candidate for overall water splitting. Our findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of 2D monolayered materials for renewable energy production. By providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of HER and OER on 2D Janus MoSH monolayer, our study paves the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for water splitting. We hope that current work will be helpful in understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer and its potential applications in renewable energy production.</description>

      <title>Highly Open Phosphorized PtNi Nanohexapod/N&#8208;doped Graphene Aerogel for High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;efficiency, and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. However, the sluggish HER kinetics and unsatisfied stability remain critical challenges for their practical applications. Herein, a hierarchically porous phosphorized Pt&#8208;Ni nanohexapod/N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel (P&#8208;PtNiNH/NGA) constructed by an oxidation&#8208;phosphorization&#8208;controlled reconfiguration strategy is presented. It enables fast water dissociation kinetics for an abundant supply of hydrogen ions, strong electron interaction for optimal intermediate adsorption, and an excellent anchoring effect of the NGA to avoid the aggregation and Ostwald ripening of the PtNiNHs, thus exhibiting superior activity and exceptional stability toward alkaline HER. The P&#8208;Pt 1 Ni 2 NH/NGA exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec &#8722;1 , and long&#8208;term stability, which are superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the P&#8208;Pt 1 Ni 2 NH/NGA shows a high mass activity of 13.4 mA &#181;g &#8722;1 and a large TOF value of 13.5 s &#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100 mV, which are 8.8 times and 9.0 times higher than commercial Pt/C (under the same Pt loading of &#8776;9.1 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 ). This work is of high inspiration for catalyst design to obtain ideal alkaline HER performance.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cey2.630</link>
      <description>Runlin Zhang, Zijin Xu, Zeyu Hao, Zeshuo Meng, Xiufeng Hao, Hongwei Tian, Carbon Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404820291

                Abstract In recent years, renewable energy sources, which aim to replace rapidly depleting fossil fuels, face challenges due to limited energy storage and conversion technologies. To enhance energy storage and conversion efficiency, extensive research has been conducted in the academic community on numerous potential materials. Among these materials, metal fluorides have attracted significant attention due to their ionic metal&#8211;fluorine bonds and tunable electronic structures, attributed to the highest electronegativity of fluorine in their chemical composition. This makes them promising candidates for future electrochemical applications in various fields. However, metal fluorides encounter various challenges in different application directions. Therefore, we comprehensively review the applications of metal fluorides in the field of energy storage and conversion, aiming to deepen our understanding of their exhibited characteristics in different electrochemical processes. In this paper, we summarize the difficulties and improvement methods encountered in different types of battery applications and several typical electrode optimization strategies in the field of supercapacitors. In the field of water electrolysis, we focus on surface reconstruction and the critical role of fluorine, demonstrating the catalytic performance of metal fluorides from the perspectives of reconstruction mechanism and process analysis. Finally, we provide a summary and outlook for this field, aiming to offer guidance for future breakthroughs in the energy storage and conversion applications of metal fluorides.</description>

                The simulation of chemical reactions or processes provides a fundamental approach to understanding chemistry.The application of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) (Kohn &amp; Sham, 1965) has become an indispensable tool for computational modeling.However, semilocal KS-DFT often fails to accurately describe long-range correlation effects, such as dispersion interactions, in many exchange-correlation functionals (Stefan Grimme et al., 2016).Additive dispersion corrections, like the D3 (S.Grimme et al., 2010) or D4 (Caldeweyher et al., 2019) methods, effectively account for these effects.</description>

      <title>Identifying key intermediates for the oxygen evolution reaction on hematite using ab-initio molecular dynamics</title>

                Hematite is a well-known catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction on photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells. However, the knowledge of hematite-water interfaces and water oxidation mechanisms is still lacking, which limits improvements in photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance. Herein, we use the Fe-terminated hematite (0001) surface as a model and propose a comprehensive mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction on both non-solvated and solvated surfaces. Key reaction intermediates are identified through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at the density functional theory level with a Hubbard U correction. Several notable intermediates are proposed, and the effects of water solvent on these intermediates and the overall reaction mechanisms are suggested. The proposed mechanisms align well with experimental observations under photoelectrochemical water oxidation conditions. Additionally, we highlight the potential role of O2 desorption in the oxygen evolution reaction on hematite, as O2 adsorption may block reaction sites and increases surface hydrophobicity, leading to an unfavorable pathway for oxygen evolution. Hematite is a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, the authors report a detailed mechanism, identifying key reaction intermediates and highlighting the influence of solvent water and oxygen desorption on the reaction pathways.</description>

                Machine learning in atomistic materials science has grown to become a powerful tool, with most approaches focusing on atomic geometry, typically decomposed into local atomic environments. This approach, while well-suited for machine-learned interatomic potentials, is conceptually at odds with learning complex intrinsic properties of materials, often driven by spectral properties commonly represented in reciprocal space (e.g., band gaps or mobilities) which cannot be readily partitioned in real space. For such applications, methods that represent the electronic rather than the atomic structure could be more promising. In this work, we present a general framework focused on electronic-structure descriptors that take advantage of the natural symmetries and inherent interpretability of physical models. We apply this framework first to material similarity and then to accelerated screening, where a model trained on 217 materials correctly labels 75% of entries in the Materials Cloud 3D database, which meet common screening criteria for promising transparent-conducting materials.</description>

      <title>Instant prediction of scientific paper cited potential based on semantic and metadata features: Taking artificial intelligence field as an example</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312945</link>
      <description>Hou Zhu, Li Shuhuai, PLoS ONE. 19(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404914188

                With the continuous increase in the number of academic researchers, the volume of scientific papers is also increasing rapidly. The challenge of identifying papers with greater potential academic impact from this large pool has received increasing attention. The citation frequency of a paper is often used as an objective indicator to gauge the academic influence of the paper. The task of citation frequency prediction based on historical citation data in previous studies can achieve high accuracy. However, it can only be executed after the paper has been published for a period. The delay is not conducive to timely discovery of papers with high citation frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting cited potential of a paper based on the metadata and semantic information, which can predict the cited potential of academic paper instantly once it has been published. Specifically, the semantic information, such as abstract, semantic span and semantic inflection, is extracted to enhance the ability of the prediction model based on machine learning. To prove the effectiveness and rationality of cited potential prediction model, we conduct two experiments to validate the model and find the most effective combination of input information. The empirical experiments show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed model can reach 88% for the instant prediction of citation.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Adsorption at the Electrochemical Metal/Water Interface: Au(111) vs Pt(111)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c06384</link>

                Reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous electrocatalysis have been known to change through the local field that arises at the electrified metal/liquid interface. First-principles simulations specifically predict that such a field can significantly modify the surface binding of dipolar or polarizable intermediates along a catalytic reaction path. This dependence can then lead to a corresponding dependence upon applied potential even for so-called "chemical" reaction steps that do not involve an explicit proton-coupled electron transfer such as, e.g., O2 adsorption during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). And yet, such effects are only now starting to be systematically explored at the atomic level. In this study, we directly compare the potential dependence of O2 adsorption as the first ORR step on Au(111) vs Pt(111). Using ab initio molecular dynamics and free energy sampling, we find that the strong dependence previously predicted at Au(111) is specifically lost at Pt(111). By decoupling the O2 potential response into contributions of different physical origin, we explain this contrast through the inherently different reactivity of the two metals. We finally discuss an indirect effect of potential through the surface coverage that can promote a dissociative-type mechanism at Pt(111) by breaking the O&#8211;O bond already during the first step of the ORR mechanism. Our results thus overall suggest a more complex mechanistic picture than hitherto anticipated; one where the local field may manifest in different, yet potentially equally important, ways over different systems.</description>

                One grand challenge for deploying porous carbons with embedded metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) moieties as platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is their fast degradation and inferior activity. Here, we report the modulation of the local environment at Fe&#8211;N4 sites via the application of atomic Sn&#8211;Nx sites for simultaneously improved durability and activity. We discovered that Sn&#8211;Nx sites not only promote the formation of the more stable D2 FeN4C10 sites but also invoke a unique D3 SnNx&#8211;FeIIN4 site that is characterized by having atomically dispersed bridged Sn&#8211;Nx and Fe&#8211;N4. This new D3 site exhibits significantly improved stability against demetalation and several times higher turnover frequency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the shift of the reaction pathway from a single-site associative mechanism to a dual-site dissociative mechanism with the adjacent Sn site facilitating a lower overpotential cleavage of the O&#8211;O bond. This mechanism bypasses the formation of the otherwise inevitable intermediate that is responsible for demetalation, where two hydroxyl intermediates bind to one Fe site. As a result, a mesoporous Fe/Sn-PNC catalyst exhibits a positively shifted ORR half-wave potential and more than 50% lower peroxide formation. This, in combination with the stable D3 site and enriched D2 Fe sites, significantly enhanced the catalyst's durability as demonstrated in membrane electrode assemblies using complementary accelerated durability testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Disrupted Spin Degeneracy Promoted C&#8801;C Triple Bond Activation for Efficient Electrochemical Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06191</link>
      <description>Menglei Yuan, Hongyu Jiang, Ruyi Jiang, Zhao Wang, Zhihao Zhao, Bao&#8208;Lian Su, Jian Zhang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404924221

                Disrupting the spin degeneracy of the electrocatalyst and further manipulating the related orbital electron arrangement are highly desirable for activating acetylene molecules. Herein, a squarate cobalt-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Co-MOF) ([Co3(C4O4)2(OH)2]&#183;3H2O) is post-treated to accelerate the evolution from CoO6 octahedron to CoO5 pentahedron and further utilized for the electrochemical acetylene semihydrogenation reaction. Comprehensive analyses corroborate that the disrupted spin degeneracy of active sites originated from the breakage of the Co&#8211;O bond, which promotes the cleavage of the orbital energy level and the rearrangement of the d-orbital electron. The newly emerged half-occupied dx2&#8211;y2 orbitals and empty dz2 orbitals in CoO5 pentahedron concerted interplay with the bonding and antibonding orbitals of acetylene, which reduces the adsorption energy of acetylene and facilitates the activation of the inert C&#8801;C triple bond. Thus, the defective Co-MOF exhibits the superior ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 96% and partial current density of 128 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE compared to that of pristine Co-MOF (FEC2H4: 60%; JC2H4: 66 mA cm&#8211;2). This work delivers inspiration for spin-state regulation of active sites and sparks renewed interest in designing highly efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                This paper thoroughly examines the latest developments and diverse applications of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in civil engineering. It provides a critical analysis of the technology&#8217;s potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. Initially, a comprehensive outline of CCUS technologies is presented, emphasising their vital function in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission capture, conversion, and sequestration. Subsequent sections provide an in-depth analysis of carbon capture technologies, utilisation processes, and storage solutions. These serve as the foundation for an architectural framework that facilitates the design and integration of efficient systems. Significant attention is given to the inventive application of CCUS in the building and construction industry. Notable examples of such applications include using carbon (C) in cement and promoting sustainable cement production. Economic analyses and financing mechanisms are reviewed to assess the commercial feasibility and scalability of CCUS projects. In addition, this review examines the technological advances and innovations that have occurred, providing insight into the potential future course of CCUS progress. A comprehensive analysis of the environmental and regulatory environments is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and compliance with the policies of CCUS technology deployment. Case studies from the real world are provided to illustrate effectiveness and practical applications. It concludes by emphasising the importance of continued research, policy support, and innovation in developing CCUS technologies as a fundamental component of sustainable civil engineering practices. A tenacious stride toward carbon neutrality is underscored.</description>

                Abstract Ligand protected gold nanoclusters have been proposed for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) as an alternative to polycrystalline catalysts, showing higher selectivity control due to the tailored composition and precise microenvironment. Here, two gold cluster families are studied with different staple motifs (Au 25 (SR) 18 and Au 144 (SR) 60 , where SR = thiolate) doped with Ag or Cu to understand the interplay between the composition and the performance of these catalysts. Detailed cluster characterization and Density Functional Theory simulations demonstrate that the dynamic aspects involving ligand removal are crucial to unraveling the role of the dopant, the cluster curvature, and the staple structure. The best activity performance toward CO is obtained for Cu&#8208;doped Au 144 (SR) 60 at U = &#8211;0.8 V RHE as ligands are only partially depleted and the staple can bend to stabilize *CO intermediate, while Cu&#8208;containing Au 25 (SR) 18 can produce formate but shows worse CO selectivity. This study points toward the importance of ligand stability during eCO 2 R on bimetallic gold nanoclusters, paving the way for improving the design and operation of this family of catalysts.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Comparative Analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Absorption Columns in Electrochemical and Thermochemical Carbon Capture Systems</title>

                Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process; however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for techno-economic and engineering analyses.</description>

      <title>Catechol-derived Mannich bases: radical regulatory properties, cytotoxicity and interaction with biomolecules</title>

                Free radicals are ubiquitous in biological systems, being responsible for pathogenesis of degenerative diseases and participating in vitally important biochemical processes, which are mediated by radical regulatory agents. The effects of the aliphatic amine substituents in the catechol-derived Mannich bases on their antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity were investigated. It has been found that the presence of catechol moiety in the structure of Mannich bases allows them to act as Cu(II) reductants, efficient Fe(II) chelators and potent DPPH radical scavengers. It has been found that the plausible mechanism of the DPPH radical scavenging proceeds via quinone formation, followed by their interaction with ethanol via the Michael addition reaction. In the neutrophil respiratory burst assay, several compounds have demonstrated a weak antioxidant activity at the micromolar level (0.1&#8211;10 &#181;M), whereas at the millimolar level (0.1 m&#1052;) a strong pro-oxidant effect has been observed. Additionally, at the highest used concentrations a pronounced cytotoxicity against dermal fibroblasts DF-2 and an immunosuppressive effect against T-lymphocytes have been observed for all the synthesized compounds. It has been demonstrated that the oxidation of catechols in the presence of low-molecular thiols results in the formation of covalent adducts, which provides an insight into their cytotoxicity and detoxification pathways.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Screening Approach for Catalytic Applications through Regulation of Adsorption Energies via Work Function</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c03385</link>
      <description>Xuhong Zhao, Jianwei Wang, Xiaobin Niu, Langmuir. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404913328

                Adsorption energy is critical in catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Optimal adsorption energy on a catalytic substrate is essential as extreme adsorption energy can reduce the reaction efficiency. Building on our previous research on the influence of work function on adsorption energy (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2024, 26, 3525&#8211;3530), we examined a range of two-dimensional semiconductor materials, including black phosphorene, boron nitride, and MoS2, as supporting substrates for the construction of silicene&#8211;semiconductor heterojunctions. Furthermore, we analyzed how work function changes impact adsorption energy during O2 adsorption and developed a theoretical model to explain this relationship. The model was validated by demonstrating the regulation of the catalytic reaction barrier in the oxygen reduction reaction and was applied to N2 adsorption via high-throughput screening. Our findings demonstrate that the work function modulates the adsorption energy in van der Waals heterojunctions, enhancing catalytic efficiency. This approach aligns with the Sabatier principle and offers a pathway for optimizing catalysts.</description>
