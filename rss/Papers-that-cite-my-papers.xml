      <title>Lattice dynamics modeling of thermal transport in solids using machine-learned atomic cluster expansion potentials: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0251119</link>
      <description>Liangshuai Guo, Yuanbin Liu, Lei Yang, Bing Cao, Journal of Applied Physics. 137(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407882290

                Lattice dynamics (LD) plays a crucial role in investigating thermal transport in terms of not only underlying physics but also novel properties and phenomena. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools in computational physics and chemistry, showing great potential in providing reliable predictions of thermal transport properties with high efficiency. This tutorial provides a comprehensive guideline for MLIPs&#8217; development and how they are used for the computational modeling of thermal transport. Using atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as the paradigmatic potential, we introduce the essential fundamentals of MLIPs, including data construction, model training, and hyperparameter optimization. With the developed ACE potentials, we further showcase their applications in the LD modeling of thermal transport for crystalline silicon and amorphous carbon. The corresponding code implementations for MLIP applications in calculating thermal conductivity are also provided for beginners to follow.</description>

      <title>Hydroxylation Strategy Enables Ru&#8211;Mn Oxide for Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis under 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c15900</link>
      <description>Susu Zhao, Qian Dang, Aiqing Cao, Marshet Getaye Sendeku, Hai Liu, Jian Peng, Yameng Fan, Hui Li, Fengmei Wang, Yun Kuang, Xiaoming Sun, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407892266

                Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have demonstrated promising utilization potentiality to replace the much expensive iridium (Ir)-based ones for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) due to their high electrochemical activity and low cost. However, the susceptibility of RuO2-based materials to easily be oxidized to high-valent and soluble Ru species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media hinders the practical application, especially under current density above 500 mA cm&#8211;2. Here, a manganese-doped RuO2 catalyst with the hydroxylated metal sites (i.e., H&#8211;Mn0.1Ru0.9O2) is synthesized for acidic OER assisted by hydrogen peroxide, where the hydroxylation results in the valence state of the Ru sites below +4. The H&#8211;Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 169 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and promising stability for an OER over 1000 h in an acidic electrolyte. A PEMWE device fabricated with the H&#8211;Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 catalyst as the anode shows a current density of 1 A cm&#8211;2 at &#8764;1.65 V, along with a low degradation over continuous tens of hours. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) results and theoretical calculations confirm that H&#8211;Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 performs the OER through the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, where the synergistic effect of hydroxylation and Mn doping in RuO2 can effectively enhance the stability of Ru sites and lattice oxygen atoms.</description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Enables Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for High&#8208;Performance Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202501387</link>
      <description>Sunce Zhao, Wenjia Ma, Beibei He, Yihan Ling, Yonglong Huang, Feng Hu, Zhu Shu, Ling Zhao, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407908043

                Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton-involved oxygen reduction reaction (P-ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single-atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3-&#948; (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid-state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single-atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4-coordinate Ru-O-Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P-ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru-BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm-2 at 700 &#176;C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single-atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.</description>

      <title>Prediction of hydration energies of adsorbates at Pt(111) and liquid water interfaces using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0248572</link>
      <description>Jiexin Shi, Xiaohong Zhang, Venkata Rohit Punyapu, Rachel B. Getman, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407917932

                Aqueous phase heterogeneous catalysis is important to various industrial processes, including biomass conversion, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis, and electrocatalysis. Accurate calculation of solvation thermodynamic properties is essential for modeling the performance of catalysts for these processes. Explicit solvation methods employing multiscale modeling, e.g., involving density functional theory and molecular dynamics have emerged for this purpose. Although accurate, these methods are computationally intensive. This study introduces machine learning (ML) models to predict solvation thermodynamics for adsorbates on a Pt(111) surface, aiming to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. In particular, ML models are developed using a combination of molecular descriptors and fingerprints and trained on previously published water&#8211;adsorbate interaction energies, energies of solvation, and free energies of solvation of adsorbates bound to Pt(111). These models achieve root mean square error values of 0.09 eV for interaction energies, 0.04 eV for energies of solvation, and 0.06 eV for free energies of solvation, demonstrating accuracy within the standard error of multiscale modeling. Feature importance analysis reveals that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, and solvent density, together with the properties of the adsorbate, are critical factors influencing solvation thermodynamics. These findings suggest that ML models can provide rapid and reliable predictions of solvation properties. This approach not only reduces computational costs but also offers insights into the solvation characteristics of adsorbates at Pt(111)&#8211;water interfaces.</description>

                The uniform dispersion and loading of phthalocyanine molecular catalysts on conductive carbon substrates are crucial for exposing their active sites. The significant amount of solvent needed to achieve appropriate dispersion of phthalocyanine leads to the risk of reaggregation during solvent evaporation. Hence, a solventless strategy is adopted by many to bypass the use of a solvent. In this study, we showcase the deposition of transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules onto a self-supporting conductive carbon cloth electrode using an environmentally friendly sublimation technique for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. We meticulously investigated the preparation conditions, including the heating temperature and TMPc type, to assess their impact on the CO2 reduction activity. The as-prepared CC-CoPc-450 electrode demonstrated an outstanding comprehensive performance, showcasing a remarkable maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.1% at -0.86 V with a current density of 8.3 mA cm-2. The electrode exhibited excellent stability during the 16 h long-term eCO2RR process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the role of d-orbitals in TM-N4 and the synergy with &#960;-conjugation electrons in facilitating the efficient electron transfer process in eCO2RR. This study offers a fresh perspective on the eco-friendly dispersion of TMPcs on conductive substrates and provides insights into the design of &#960;-species macrocyclic electrocatalyst electrodes.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated theoretically on modified rutile(110) surfaces at density functional theory level in search for inexpensive but active catalyst materials required for water electrolysis. Ti substitution by Nb in rutile and furthermore adding adlayers of transition metal (TM) oxides, with TM =${ = }$ Ir, Ru and Rh, substantially improves titania OER activity. The catalytic activity was assessed by the overpotential of the OER which was calculated from adsorption energies of the intermediates M-O, M-OH and M-OOH. Different reaction mechanisms were suggested depending on the presence or absence of M-OOH. Materials with iridium dioxide in the top layer have similar overpotentials, both as adlayer on (doped) TiO2${{\rm{TiO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ and as pure IrO2${{\rm{IrO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ . Thus, the percentage of this expensive and scarce element can be drastically reduced without deteriorating the activity. A monolayer of RuO2${{\rm{RuO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ on rutile TiO2${{\rm{TiO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ has an even lower overpotential compared to pure RuO2${{\rm{RuO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ . In addition, RhO2${{\rm{RhO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ and RhO2${{\rm{RhO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ : Nb1/3Ti2/3O2${{\rm{Nb}}_{{\rm{1/3}}} {\rm{Ti}}_{{\rm{2/3}}} {\rm{O}}_{\rm{2}} }$ were identified as catalysts with higher OER activity than IrO2${{\rm{IrO}}_{\rm{2}} }$ .</description>

                The photovoltaic-alkaline water (PV-AW) electrolysis system offers an appealing approach for large-scale green hydrogen generation. However, current PV-AW systems suffer from low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies (e.g., &lt;20%) at practical current densities (e.g., &gt;100 mA cm &#8722;2 ), rendering the produced H 2 not economical. Here, we designed and developed a highly efficient PV-AW system that mainly consists of a customized, state-of-the-art AW electrolyzer and concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) receiver. The highly efficient anodic oxygen evolving catalyst, consisting of an iron oxide/nickel (oxy)hydroxide (Fe 2 O 3 -NiO x H y ) composite, enables the customized AW electrolyzer with unprecedented catalytic performance (e.g., 1 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.8 V and 0.37 kgH 2 /m &#8722;2 hour &#8722;1 at 48 kWh/kgH 2 ). Benefiting from the superior water electrolysis performance, the integrated CPV-AW electrolyzer system reaches a very high STH efficiency of up to 29.1% (refer to 30.3% if the lead resistance losses are excluded) at large current densities, surpassing all previously reported PV-electrolysis systems.</description>

      <title>Blocking Effect Retards Electron Release from Asymmetric Active Units for Selective Seawater Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c17958</link>
      <description>Zhipeng Li, Huimin Mao, Xiaobin Liu, Jun Wan, Jing&#8208;Qi Chi, Shaobo Huang, Qingliang Lv, Zexing Wu, Lei Wang, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407958992

                During seawater electrolysis, chloride ion (Cl&#8211;) adsorption at the anode leads to an inevitable competitive chloride oxidation reaction (ClOR) with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), compromising the long-term stability of the electrolysis process. Furthermore, Ni-based OER electrocatalysts are challenged by activity degradation due to the overoxidation of Ni3+. In response, we present a design of oxygen-vacancy-regulated asymmetric Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bonds aimed at selective seawater oxidation. The experimental and in situ characterization results indicate that the blocking effect of oxygen vacancies effectively alleviates the electron release of Ni3+ and the electron enrichment of Nb5+ on asymmetric Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bonds, achieving a stable and selective OER in alkaline seawater. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that oxygen vacancies in Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bonds optimize the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates and break up the scaling relationship between *OH and *OOH intermediates. The constructed anion exchange membrane electrolysis cell achieves a cost efficiency of $1.07 per GGE (gasoline gallon equivalent) for H2 production at a current density of 1000 mA cm&#8211;2, maintaining operational stability for 100 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2.</description>

      <title>Digital Descriptors in Predicting Catalysis Reaction Efficiency and Selectivity</title>

                Accurately controlling the interactions and dynamic changes between multiple active sites (e.g., metals, vacancies, and lone pairs of heteroatoms) to achieve efficient catalytic performance is a key issue and challenge in the design of complex catalytic reactions involving 2D metal-supported catalysts, metal-zeolites, metal-organic catalysts, and metalloenzymes. With the aid of machine learning (ML), descriptors play a central role in optimizing the electrochemical performance of catalysts, elucidating the essence of catalytic activity, and predicting more efficient catalysts, thereby avoiding time-consuming trial-and-error processes. Three kinds of descriptors&#9472;active center descriptors, interfacial descriptors, and reaction pathway descriptors&#9472;are crucial for understanding and designing metal-supported catalysts. Specifically, vacancies, as active sites, synergize with metals to significantly promote the reduction reactions of energy-relevant small molecules. By combining some physical descriptors, interpretable descriptors can be constructed to evaluate catalytic performance. Future development of descriptors and ML models faces the challenge of constructing descriptors for vacancies in multicatalysis systems to rationally design the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts. Utilization of generative artificial intelligence and multimodal ML to automatically extract descriptors would accelerate the exploration of dynamic reaction mechanisms. The transferable descriptors from metal-supported catalysts to artificial metalloenzymes provide innovative solutions for energy conversion and environmental protection.</description>

      <title>Theory-Guided Design of N-Confused Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c18645</link>

                Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enable the precise and controlled synthesis of single-atom catalysts with uniformly distributed active metal centers, offering opportunities to elucidate the impact of subtle coordination environment changes on the catalytic performance. Inspired by N-confused porphyrins, we designed 20 metalloporphyrin-based COFs with either M-N3C1 or M-N4 centers, where M refers to 3d transition metals from Sc to Zn, for the electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Density functional theory calculations predicted Co-based COFs to be the best ORR catalysts among the screened catalysts. Hence, Co-N3C1-COF and Co-N4-COF with a high crystallinity were synthesized. The Co-N3C1-COF exhibited improved ORR performance over the parent Co-N4-COF, as it had a reduced overpotential and increased four-electron selectivity, corroborating theoretical predictions. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the increase in electron density on Co as the coordination environment transits from Co-N4 to Co-N3C1. This not only facilitated the adsorption of O2 and critical intermediates but also changed the potential-determining step, which in turn made the ORR free energy profile of Co-N3C1-COF approach equilibrium for all elementary steps, thus leading to a reduced overpotential. This combined theoretical and experimental work exemplified carbon coordination in porphyrin-based COFs as an effective strategy to facilitate the catalytic capability for ORR. A descriptor was also provided to guide the design of coordination-varied Por-COFs catalysts.</description>

                Identifying exceptional electrocatalysts from the vast materials space remains a formidable challenge. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool to address this challenge, offering high efficiency while maintaining good accuracy in predictions. From this perspective, we provide a brief overview of recent advancements in ML for electrocatalyst discoveries. We emphasize the applications of physics-informed ML (PIML) models and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to electrocatalyst development, through which valuable physical and chemical insights can be distilled. Additionally, we delve into the challenges faced by PIML approaches, explore future directions, and discuss potential breakthroughs that could revolutionize the field of electrocatalyst development.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for discrimination of phase&#8208;change chalcogenide glasses</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/inf2.70006</link>
      <description>Qundao Xu, Meng Xu, Siqi Tang, Shaojie Yuan, Ming Xu, Wei Zhang, Xianbin Li, Zhongrui Wang, Xiangshui Miao, Chengliang Wang, Matthias Wuttig, InfoMat. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407985569

                Abstract Chalcogenides, despite their versatile functionality, share a notably similar local structure in their amorphous states. Particularly in electronic phase&#8208;change memory applications, distinguishing these glasses from neighboring compositions that do not possess memory capabilities is inherently difficult when employing traditional analytical methods. This has led to a dilemma in materials design since an atomistic view of the arrangement in the amorphous state is the key to understanding and optimizing the functionality of these glasses. To tackle this challenge, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to separate electronic phase&#8208;change materials (ePCMs) from other chalcogenides, based upon subtle differences in the short&#8208;range order inside the glassy phase. Leveraging the established structure&#8211;property relations in chalcogenide glasses, we select suitable features to train accurate machine learning models, even with a modestly sized dataset. The trained model accurately discerns the critical transition point between glass compositions suitable for use as ePCMs and those that are not, particularly for both GeTe&#8211;GeSe and Sb 2 Te 3 &#8211;Sb 2 Se 3 materials, in line with experiments. Furthermore, by extracting the physical knowledge that the ML model has offered, we pinpoint three pivotal structural features of amorphous chalcogenides, that is, the bond angle, packing efficiency, and the length of the fourth bond, which provide a map for materials design with the ability to &#8220;predict&#8221; and &#8220;explain&#8221;. All three of the above features point to the smaller Peierls&#8208;like distortion and more well&#8208;defined octahedral clusters in amorphous ePCMs than non&#8208;ePCMs. Our study delves into the mechanisms shaping these structural attributes in amorphous ePCMs, yielding valuable insights for the AI&#8208;powered discovery of novel materials. image</description>

      <title>Machine-learning prediction of facet-dependent CO coverage on Cu electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20517/jmi.2024.77</link>
      <description>Shanglin Wu, Shisheng Zheng, Wentao Zhang, Mingzheng Zhang, Shunning Li, Feng Pan, Journal of Materials Informatics. 5(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407986232

                Copper-based electrocatalysts, which hold great promise in selectively reducing CO2 into multicarbon products, have attracted significant recent interest, both experimentally and theoretically. While many studies have suggested a strong dependence of catalytic selectivity on the concentration of the *CO reaction intermediate on the Cu surface, it remains challenging for a direct experimental probe of the CO coverage. This necessitates a reliable computational method that can accurately establish the theoretical coverage-dependent phase diagram of CO adsorbates on the catalyst. Here we propose a scheme composed of density functional theory calculations, machine-learning force fields and graph neural networks as a solution. This method enables a fast screening of 7 million adsorption configurations based on a small set of density functional theory data, with a balance between accuracy and efficiency tuned by the combinatorial use of machine-learning force field and graph neural network models. We have investigated eight different Cu facets and discovered that the high-index facets such as (310), (210) and (322) exhibit a much higher CO coverage than the low-index counterparts such as (111), leading to an increased opportunity for C-C coupling for the former. Our results can provide a new perspective for the understanding of the fundamental role of CO coverage on the Cu surface for electrochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

                The extended tight binding (xTB) family of methods opened many new possibilities in the field of computational chemistry. Within just 5 years, the GFN2-xTB parametrization for all elements up to Z = 86 enabled more than a thousand applications, which were previously not feasible with other electronic structure methods. The xTB methods provide a robust and efficient way to apply quantum mechanics-based approaches for obtaining molecular geometries, computing free energy corrections or describing noncovalent interactions and found applicability for many more targets. A crucial contribution to the success of the xTB methods is the availability within many simulation packages and frameworks, supported by the open source development of its program library and packages. We present a comprehensive summary of the applications and capabilities of xTB methods in different fields of chemistry. Moreover, we consider the main software packages for xTB calculations, covering their current ecosystem, novel features, and usage by the scientific community.</description>

                This paper describes a simple design methodology to develop layered PtSe2 catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis operating under ultralow overpotentials. This approach relies on the transfer of mechanically exfoliated PtSe2 flakes to gold thin films on prestrained thermoplastic substrates. By relieving the prestrain, a tunable level of uniaxial internal compressive and tensile strain is developed in the flakes as a result of spontaneously formed surface wrinkles, giving rise to band structure modulations with overlapped values of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. This strain-engineered PtSe2 with an optimized level of internal tensile strain amplifies the HER performance of the PtSe2, with performance far greater than that of pure platinum due to significantly reduced charge transfer resistance. Density functional theory calculations provide fundamental insight into how strain-induced band structure engineering correlates with the promoted HER activity, especially at the atomic edge sites of the materials.</description>

                The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) provides a sustainable alternative to ammonia synthesis. However, the development of catalysts with high activity and selectivity under ambient conditions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a class of dual-atom catalysts (DACs), consisting of two metal atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped porous graphene (M2NPG) supported on a ferroelectric &#945;-In2Se3 monolayer. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explore the effect of ferroelectric polarization switching on the structural stability, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanisms of these DACs. By computationally screening 27 metal atoms as active sites, we identify four promising candidates (V, Co, Ru, and Ta) with V2NPG@In2Se3 standing out due to its exceptional properties. The precise control of NRR pathways, along with tunable limiting potentials and selective product formation, can be achieved through the polarization switching of the &#945;-In2Se3 monolayer. The combination of low limiting potential, abundant active sites, tunable catalytic behavior, and high selectivity against the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) highlights the potential of V2NPG@In2Se3 as a promising alternative to traditional single-atom catalysts. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy for integrating DACs with ferroelectric materials, offering valuable insights into designing next-generation catalysts for NRR and beyond.</description>

                Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a versatile material with numerous polymorphs that holds significant promise in catalysis and energy storage applications. Due to the different connection forms of Mn&#8211;O octahedra, the structural diversity of MnO2 exists in more than 20 crystal forms. Common crystal phases of MnO2 include traditional crystal phases such as &#945;-MnO2, &#946;-MnO2, &#947;-MnO2, R-MnO2. In this work, we employed the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method combined with first-principles calculations to predict 3 kinds of unreported metastable MnO2 crystals, P21/C&#8211;1-MnO2, Pbcn-MnO2, and P21/C&#8211;2-MnO2. We then systematically analyze these 3 structures have lower energy than &#945;-MnO2 which is widely used and stable in nature and they have better potential application in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, P21/C&#8211;2-MnO2 exhibited superior catalytic activity, featuring lower theoretical overpotentials than conventional MnO2 phases. These findings expand the known polymorphs of MnO2 and provide valuable insights into their potential in catalysis and energy storage, offering theoretical guidance for future experimental research.</description>

      <title>Recent Research on the Anti-Poisoning Catalysts in the Catalytic Oxidation of VOCs: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15030234</link>
      <description>Longfei Wang, Chun Huang, Ziting Gao, Bing Cui, Mingqin Zhao, Menglan Xiao, Xiaolin Yu, Catalysts. 15(3)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408036094

                Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and other industries have serious damage to human health and the environment. Catalytic oxidation is a promising method to eliminate air pollution due to its high efficiency, wide application range, and environmental friendliness. However, in the actual industrial environment, the composition of industrial exhaust gases is complex, including VOCs, water vapour, chloride, sulfide and so on. The impurities would have competitive adsorption with reactants or react with the active sites, leading to the decline of catalytic activity, even the deactivation of catalysts. Therefore, this review summarises the recent research on the anti-poisoning ability of catalysts in the catalytic oxidation of VOCs, primarily focusing on the effect of water vapour, chloride, and sulfide. The catalytic oxidation mechanism manifested that the adsorption and activation of reactants are significant in VOCs degradation. On this basis, the mechanism of catalyst poisoning was analysed, and the inhibitory effect of impurities on the oxidation reaction was elucidated. According to the research status, three anti-poisoning strategies are proposed, including building a bimetallic system, modifying supports, and establishing the protected coating. This work provides a theoretical foundation and reference point for the rational construction of anti-poisoning catalysts in VOCs elimination.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416932122</link>
      <description>Fabian L. Thiemann, Camille Scalliet, Erich A. M&#252;ller, Angelos Michaelides, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 122(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408045618

                Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material&#8217;s morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalizes puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

                Current nitrate production involves a two-step thermochemical process that is energy-intensive and generates substantial CO2 emissions. Sustainable NO3&#8211; production via the nitrogen electrooxidation reaction powered by renewable electricity is highly desirable, but the Faradaic efficiency (FE) at high production rates is unsatisfactory due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we propose reengineering the catalyst's microstructure-to-macroenvironment interface by particularly utilizing the previously considered unfavored oxygen from the OER. We demonstrate that the re-engineered interface facilitates a record-breaking FE of 35.52% under 8 atm air, with an impressive increase in FE (41.56%) observed during a continuous electrochemical process lasting for 60 h due to the in situ formation of the O2-rich macro-interface environment. The revelation is anticipated to furnish groundbreaking perspectives for the reaction systems design in electrochemical nitrate production and other electrocatalytic fields.</description>

                Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis offers an efficient route to large-scale green hydrogen production, in which the RuO2 catalyst exhibits superior activity but limited stability. Unveiling the atomic-scale structural evolution during operando reaction conditions is critical but remains a grand challenge for enhancing the durability of the RuO2 catalyst in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (a-OER). This study proposes an adaptive machine learning workflow to elucidate the potential-dependent state-to-state global evolution of the RuO2(110) surface within a complex composition and configuration space, revealing the correlation between structural patterns and stability. We identify the active state with distorted RuO5 units that self-evolve at low potential, which exhibits minor Ru dissolution and an activity self-promotion phenomenon. However, this state exhibits a low potential resistance capacity (PRC) and evolves into inert RuO4 units at elevated potential. To enhance PRC and mitigate the overevolution of the active state, we explore the metal doping engineering and uncover an inverse volcano-type doping rule: the doped metal-oxygen bond strength should significantly differ from the Ru-O bond. This rule provides a theoretical framework for designing stable RuO2-based catalysts and clarifies current discrepancies regarding the roles of different metals in stabilizing RuO2. Applying this rule, we predict and confirm experimentally that Na can effectively stabilize RuO2 in its active state. The synthesized Na-RuO2 operates in a-OER for over 1800 h without any degradation and enables long-term durability in PEM electrolysis. This work enhances our understanding of the operando structural evolution of RuO2 and aids in designing durable catalysts for a-OER.</description>

                Computational modeling is an integral part of catalysis research. With it, new methodologies are being developed and implemented to improve the accuracy of simulations while reducing the computational cost. In particular, specific machine-learning techniques have been applied to build interatomic potential from ab initio results. Here, we report an energy-free machine-learning calculator that combines three individually trained neural networks to predict the energy and atomic forces of metallic particles. The investigated structures were a monometallic Pd nanoparticle, a bimetallic AuPd nanoalloy, and supported Pd metal crystallites on silica. Atomic energies were predicted via a graph neural network, leading to a mean absolute error (MAE) within 0.004 eV from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The task of predicting atomic forces was split over two feed-forward networks, one predicting the force norm and another its direction. The force prediction resulted in a MAE within 0.080 eV/&#197; against DFT results. The interpretability of the graph neural network predictions was demonstrated by underlying the physics of the monometallic particle in the form of cohesion energy.</description>
