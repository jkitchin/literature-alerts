                Abstract NiFe&#8208;based nanomaterials are extensively studied as one of the promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their practical application is still largely impeded by the unsatisfied activity and poor durability caused by the severe leaching of active species. Herein, a rapid and facile combustion method is developed to synthesize the vertical graphene (VG) supported N&#8208;doped carbon modified (Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se composites (NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG). The interconnected heterostructure of obtained materials plays a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance, offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron and ion transport. The incorporation of Se into NiFe facilitates the formation of active species via in situ surface reconstruction. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the in situ formation of a Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 Se/Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 OOH layer significantly enhances the catalytic activity of NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG. Furthermore, the surface&#8208;adsorbed selenoxide species contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic active phase and increase the overall stability. The obtained NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 300 h. This work offers a novel perspective on the design and fabrication of OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.</description>

                Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a cutting-edge advancement in nanomaterials, merging the high catalytic efficiency of natural enzymes with the benefits of atomic economy. Traditionally, natural enzymes exhibit high specificity and efficiency, but their stability are limited by environmental conditions and production costs. Here we show that SAzymes, with their large specific surface area and high atomic utilization, achieve superior catalytic activity. However, their high dispersibility poses stability challenges. Our review focuses on recent structural and preparative advancements aimed at enhancing the catalytic specificity and stability of SAzymes. Compared to previous nanozymes, SAzymes demonstrate significantly improved performance in biomedical applications, particularly in tumor medicine. This progress positions SAzymes as a promising tool for future cancer treatment strategies, integrating the robustness of inorganic materials with the specificity of biological systems. The development and application of SAzymes could revolutionize the field of biocatalysis, offering a stable, cost-effective alternative to natural enzymes.</description>

      <title>NJmat: Data-Driven Machine Learning Interface to Accelerate Material Design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00493</link>
      <description>Yiru Huang, Lei Zhang, Hao Deng, Junfei Mao, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401508126

                Machine learning techniques have significantly transformed the way materials scientists conduct research. However, the widespread deployment of machine learning software in daily experimental and simulation research for materials and chemical design has been limited. This is partly due to the substantial time investment and learning curve associated with mastering the necessary codes and computational environments. In this paper, we introduce a user-friendly, data-driven machine learning interface featuring multiple "button-clicking" functionalities to streamline the design of materials and chemicals. This interface automates the processes of transforming materials and molecules, performing feature selection, constructing machine learning models, making virtual predictions, and visualizing results. Such automation accelerates materials prediction and analysis in the inverse design process, aligning with the time criteria outlined by the Materials Genome Initiative. With simple button clicks, researchers can build machine learning models and predict new materials once they have gathered experimental or simulation data. Beyond the ease of use, NJmat offers three additional features for data-driven materials design: (1) automatic feature generation for both inorganic materials (from chemical formulas) and organic molecules (from SMILES), (2) automatic generation of Shapley plots, and (3) automatic construction of "white-box" genetic models and decision trees to provide scientific insights. We present case studies on surface design for halide perovskite materials encompassing both inorganic and organic species. These case studies illustrate general machine learning models for virtual predictions as well as the automatic featurization and Shapley/genetic model construction capabilities. We anticipate that this software tool will expedite materials and molecular design within the scope of the Materials Genome Initiative, particularly benefiting experimentalists.</description>

                Abstract Molecular catalysts represent an exceptional class of materials in the realm of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), offering distinct advantages owing to their adaptable structure, which enables precise control of electronic configurations and outstanding performance in CO 2 RR. This study introduces an innovative approach to heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 RR in an aqueous environment, utilizing a newly synthesized N4&#8208;macrocyclic cobalt complex generated through a dimerization coupling reaction. By incorporating the quaterpyridine moiety, this cobalt complex exhibits the capability to catalyze CO 2 RR at low overpotentials and reaches near&#8208;unity CO production across a wide potential range, as verified by the online mass spectrometry and in situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Comprehensive computational models demonstrate the superiority of utilizing quarterpyridine moiety in mediating CO 2 conversion compared to the counterpart. This work not only propels the field of electrochemical CO 2 RR but also underscores the promising potential of cobalt complexes featuring quaterpyridine moieties in advancing sustainable CO 2 conversion technologies within aqueous environments.</description>

      <title>New global minimum conformers for the Pt19 and Pt20 clusters. Low symmetric species featuring different active sites</title>

                Abstract The study of Pt clusters and nanoparticles is a prominent area of research due to their ex- tensive range of potential technological applications, particularly in the field of catalysis. The electronic properties of Pt clusters that result in optimal catalytic performance at the nanoscale are significantly influenced by their size and structure. In this report, we sought to evaluate the lowest-energy candidates for Pt18&#8722;20 species via Density Functional Theory, identifying more favorable conformers than those previously documented in the literature. New low-symmetry conformers for the Pt19 and Pt20 systems were identified, which are 3.0 and 1.0 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than previously reported structures (Phys. Rev. B: Condens. Matter Mater. Phys., 2008, 77, 205418). Furthermore, we examined the impact of diverse DFT ap- proximations, including GGA (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS, M06-L), hybrid (PBE0 and PBEh), meta-GGA hybrid (TPSSh), and range-separated hybrid (&#969;B97x) functionals. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the employed basis sets in determining the relative energies and structures of the investigated clusters. Our findings indicate that a correct energy ordering for the different isomers examined can only be achieved by employing density functional approximations that incorporate moderate levels of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, in conjunction with the utilization of basis sets of at least quadruple-zeta quality. The resulting structures are asymmetric, with different active sites as evidenced by the analysis of the sigma holes on the electrostatic potential surface. This observation suggests a potential correlation between the electronic structure and the catalytic properties of these Pt clusters, which merits further investigation. We expect that this work will prove to be a valuable reference point for future electronic structure reports dealing with the precise ordering of structures in the determination of global minima of metallic clusters.</description>

      <title>Real-space imaging for discovering a rotated node structure in metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51384-9</link>

                Resolving the detailed structures of metal organic frameworks is of great significance for understanding their structure-property relation. Real-space imaging methods could exhibit superiority in revealing not only the local structure but also the bulk symmetry of these complex porous materials, compared to reciprocal-space diffraction methods, despite the technical challenges. Here we apply a low-dose imaging technique to clearly resolve the atomic structures of building units in a metal-organic framework, MIL-125. An unexpected node structure is discovered by directly imaging the rotation of Ti-O nodes, different from the unrotated structure predicted by previous X-ray diffraction. The imaged structure and symmetry can be confirmed by the structural simulations and energy calculations. Then, the distribution of node rotation from the edge to the center of a MIL-125 particle is revealed by the image analysis of Ti-O rotation. The related defects and surface terminations in MIL-125 are also investigated in the real-space images. These results not only unraveled the node symmetry in MIL-125 with atomic resolution but also inspired further studies on discovering more unpredicted structural changes in other porous materials by real-space imaging methods.</description>

                Platinum exhibits desirable catalytic properties, but it is scarce and expensive. Optimizing its use in key applications such as emission control catalysis is important to reduce our reliance on such a rare element. Supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) used in emission control systems deactivate over time because of particle growth in sintering processes. In this work, we shed light on the stability against sintering of Pt NPs supported on and encapsulated in Al</description>

                Abstract Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are an important enabler of the nascent hydrogen economy. However, due to the reliance on precious metal catalysts like platinum, reducing the cost and broad penetration of PEMFCs beyond vehicle application remains a challenge. In this respect, alternative non&#8208;precious metal catalysts and other carbon&#8208;based catalysts remain the holy grail toward advanced low&#8208;cost PEMFC. This review summarizes recent progress along the development of non&#8208;precious catalysts and their performance under PEMFC operation. Critical factors such as the activity, stability, and durability of non&#8208;precious metal catalysts and their associated mechanisms including the paths leading to degradation are discussed. Ultimately, the review concludes by highlighting the impressive activity and potential of NPM catalysts and the areas of focus to enable the translation of non&#8208;precious catalysts to commercially viable PEMFC systems.</description>

      <title>i-PI 3.0: A flexible and efficient framework for advanced atomistic simulations</title>

                Atomic-scale simulations have progressed tremendously over the past decade, largely thanks to the availability of machine-learning interatomic potentials. These potentials combine the accuracy of electronic structure calculations with the ability to reach extensive length and time scales. The i-PI package facilitates integrating the latest developments in this field with advanced modeling techniques thanks to a modular software architecture based on inter-process communication through a socket interface. The choice of Python for implementation facilitates rapid prototyping but can add computational overhead. In this new release, we carefully benchmarked and optimized i-PI for several common simulation scenarios, making such overhead negligible when i-PI is used to model systems up to tens of thousands of atoms using widely adopted machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Behler&#8211;Parinello, DeePMD, and MACE neural networks. We also present the implementation of several new features, including an efficient algorithm to model bosonic and fermionic exchange, a framework for uncertainty quantification to be used in conjunction with machine-learning potentials, a communication infrastructure that allows for deeper integration with electronic-driven simulations, and an approach to simulate coupled photon-nuclear dynamics in optical or plasmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in atomistic simulations of silicon using interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0214590</link>
      <description>I. R. Best, T. J. Sullivan, James R. Kermode, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401584960

                Atomistic simulations often rely on interatomic potentials to access greater time and length scales than those accessible to first-principles methods, such as density functional theory. However, since a parameterized potential typically cannot reproduce the true potential energy surface of a given system, we should expect a decrease in accuracy and increase in error in quantities of interest calculated from these simulations. Quantifying the uncertainty on the outputs of atomistic simulations is thus an important, necessary step so that there is confidence in the results and available metrics to explore improvements in said simulations. Here, we address this research question by forming ensembles of atomic cluster expansion potentials, and using conformal prediction with ab initio training data to provide meaningful, calibrated error bars on several quantities of interest for silicon: the bulk modulus, elastic constants, relaxed vacancy formation energy, and the vacancy migration barrier. We evaluate the effects on uncertainty bounds using a range of different potentials and training sets.</description>

      <title>Grand canonically optimized grain boundary phases in hexagonal close-packed titanium</title>

                Abstract Grain boundaries (GBs) profoundly influence the properties and performance of materials, emphasizing the importance of understanding the GB structure and phase behavior. As recent computational studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple GB phases associated with varying the atomic density at the interface, we introduce a validated, open-source GRand canonical Interface Predictor (GRIP) tool that automates high-throughput, grand canonical optimization of GB structures. While previous studies of GB phases have almost exclusively focused on cubic systems, we demonstrate the utility of GRIP in an application to hexagonal close-packed titanium. We perform a systematic high-throughput exploration of tilt GBs in titanium and discover previously unreported structures and phase transitions. In low-angle boundaries, we demonstrate a coupling between point defect absorption and the change in the GB dislocation network topology due to GB phase transformations, which has important implications for the accommodation of radiation-induced defects.</description>

                We present an efficient first-principles based method geared toward reliably predicting the structures of solid materials across the Periodic Table. To this end, we use a density functional theory baseline with a compact, near-minimal min+s basis set, yielding low computational costs and memory demands. Since the use of such a small basis set leads to systematic errors in chemical bond lengths, we develop a linear pairwise correction, available for elements Z = 1&#8211;86 (excluding the lanthanide series), parameterized for use with the Perdew&#8211;Burke&#8211;Ernzerhof exchange&#8211;correlation functional. We demonstrate the reliability of this corrected approach for equilibrium volumes across the Periodic Table and the transferability to differently coordinated environments and multi-elemental crystals. We examine relative energies, forces, and stresses in geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

                Rapid generation of a plausible reaction path connecting a given reactant and product in advance is crucial for the efficient computation of precise reaction paths or transition states. We propose a computationally efficient potential energy based on the molecular structure to generate such paths. This potential energy has a flat bottom consisting of structures without atomic collisions while preserving nonreactive chemical bonds, bond angles, and partial planar structures. By combining this potential energy with the direct MaxFlux method, a recently developed reaction-path/transition-state search method, we can find the shortest plausible path passing within the bottom. Numerical results show that this combination yields lower energy paths compared to the paths obtained by the well-known image-dependent pair potential. We also theoretically investigate the differences between these two potential energies. The proposed potential energy and path generation routine are implemented in our Python version of the direct MaxFlux method, available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Improving Machine Learned Force Fields for Complex Fluids through Enhanced Sampling: A Liquid Crystal Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c01546</link>

                Machine learned force fields offer the potential for faster execution times while retaining the accuracy of traditional DFT calculations, making them promising candidates for molecular simulations in cases where reliable classical force fields are not available. Some of the challenges associated with machine learned force fields include simulation stability over extended periods of time and ensuring that the statistical and dynamical properties of the underlying simulated systems are correctly captured. In this work, we propose a systematic training pipeline for such force fields that leads to improved model quality, compared to that achieved by traditional data generation and training approaches. That pipeline relies on the use of enhanced sampling techniques, and it is demonstrated here in the context of a liquid crystal, which exemplifies many of the challenges that are encountered in fluids and materials with complex free energy landscapes. Our results indicate that, whereas the majority of traditional machine learned force field training approaches lead to molecular dynamics simulations that are only stable over hundred-picosecond trajectories, our approach allows for stable simulations over tens of nanoseconds for organic molecular systems comprising thousands of atoms.</description>

                The large production volumes of commodity polyolefins (specifically, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride)), in conjunction with their low unit values and multitude of short-term uses, have resulted in a significant and pressing waste management challenge. Only a small fraction of these polyolefins is currently mechanically recycled, with the rest being incinerated, accumulating in landfills, or leaking into the natural environment. Since polyolefins are energy-rich materials, there is considerable interest in recouping some of their chemical value while simultaneously motivating more responsible end-of-life management. An emerging strategy is catalytic depolymerization, in which a portion of the C-C bonds in the polyolefin backbone is broken with the assistance of a catalyst and, in some cases, additional small molecule reagents. When the products are small molecules or materials with higher value in their own right, or as chemical feedstocks, the process is called upcycling. This review summarizes recent progress for four major catalytic upcycling strategies: hydrogenolysis, (hydro)cracking, tandem processes involving metathesis, and selective oxidation. Key considerations include macromolecular reaction mechanisms relative to small molecule mechanisms, catalyst design for macromolecular transformations, and the effect of process conditions on product selectivity. Metrics for describing polyolefin upcycling are critically evaluated, and an outlook for future advances is described.</description>

                ABSTRACT Ni, Fe&#8208;based nitrides have been widely studied for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, displaying electrocatalytic activities similar to Pt and other noble metal electrocatalysts. The incorporation of small amounts of Mo or W on these Ni, Fe&#8208;based nitrides is expected to have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance of these materials, especially for the HER activity. In this work, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) with the empirical formula Ni 1+ x Fe 3&#8722; x &#8722; y A y N (A = Mo, W), were obtained in two steps: synthesis of the transition metal oxide precursors by an easy, one&#8208;pot sol&#8211;gel polymerization method followed by nitridation under ammonia atmosphere to obtain the final TMNs. Their HER and OER catalytic performances in alkaline electrolyte (0.1 M KOH solution) were studied and it was observed that the incorporation of small quantities of Mo or W in these Ni, Fe&#8208;based nitrides (Ni 1+ x Fe 3&#8722; x &#8722; y A y N, where y = 0.1) results in improved HER and OER activities, especially in the TMN that contains W (i.e., Ni 1+ x Fe 2.9&#8722; x W 0.1 N), where the overpotentials were 348 mV for OER and 269 mV for HER. These values are lower than those obtained for Ni 1+ x Fe 3&#8722; x N, which are 395 mV for OER and 368 mV for HER.</description>

                Abstract Alkaline water electrolysis is the promising technical pathway of large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production. However, its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is hindered by the alkaline environment, leading to slow H 2 O splitting kinetics, especially for NiMoCu alloy catalysts which are considered potential alkaline HER catalysts. In this work, the Ru&#8208;substrate modified NiMoCu 20 porous electrode is designed by a continuous multistep electrodeposition method. It shows the good alkaline HER performance at the high current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is attributed to the synergistic charge&#8208;reconfiguration effects between Ru&#8208;substrate and NiMoCu alloy by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman spectra analysis. It indicates that the Ru&#8208;substrate is capable of encouraging H&#8208;OH* bond breakage and optimizing transition&#8208;state H* adsorption. Further, the overall water electrolysis results of the alkaline water electrolysis cell (30 wt% KOH) at 70 &#176;C show that it has good performance at the large current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 with 2.05 V and good stability at 600 mA cm &#8722;2 up to 500 h. It provides the possibility of designing the high&#8208;performance HER electrode from the view of industrial applications.</description>

      <title>New global minimum conformers for the Pt$$_{19}$$ and Pt$$_{20}$$ clusters: low symmetric species featuring different active sites</title>

                Abstract Context The study of platinum (Pt) clusters and nanoparticles is essential due to their extensive range of potential technological applications, particularly in catalysis. The electronic properties that yield optimal catalytic performance at the nanoscale are significantly influenced by the size and structure of Pt clusters. This research aimed to identify the lowest-energy conformers for Pt $$_{18}$$    18    , Pt $$_{19}$$    19    , and Pt $$_{20}$$    20    species using Density Functional Theory (DFT). We discovered new low-symmetry conformers for Pt $$_{19}$$    19    and Pt $$_{20}$$    20    , which are 3.0 and 1.0 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than previously reported structures. Our study highlights the importance of using density functional approximations that incorporate moderate levels of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, alongside basis sets of at least quadruple-zeta quality. The resulting structures are asymmetric with varying active sites, as evidenced by sigma hole analysis on the electrostatic potential surface. This suggests a potential correlation between electronic structure and catalytic properties, warranting further investigation. Methods An equivariant graph neural network interatomic potential (NequIP) within the Atomic Simulation Environment suite (ASE) was used to provide initial geometries of the aggregates under study. DFT calculations were performed with the ORCA 5 package, using functional approximations that included Generalized Gradient Approximation (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS, M06-L), hybrid (PBE0, PBEh), meta-GGA hybrid (TPSSh), and range-separated hybrid ( $$\omega $$  &#969;  B97x) functionals. Def2-TZVP and Def2-QZVP as well as members of the cc-pwCVXZ-PP family to check basis set convergence were used. QTAIM calculations were performed using the AIMAll suite. Structures were visualized with the AVOGADRO code.</description>

      <title>Binding energies of CD4 and fragment species to Pt(111): Implications for measurements of anion electron stimulated desorption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0223725</link>
      <description>Norhan Omar, Pierre Cloutier, Christophe Ramseyer, A. D. Bass, L&#233;on Sanche, M. Fromm, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401549124

                We consider the electron stimulated desorption, via dissociative electron attachment, of anionic species from thin condensed CD4 films deposited on a Pt substrate and compare experimentally observed desorption yields with density functional theory calculations of the binding energies of various anionic and neutral moieties to Pt(111). Certain species (which can be considered chemisorbed) exhibit very high binding energies and large charge transfer with the substrate. Other "physisorbed" species have much lower binding energies. Species that chemisorb have lower desorption yields than those that physisorb, especially at 1-2 monolayer coverage of the Pt substrate. The binding energy of D- to Pt is the weakest, and experimentally, the desorption yield is the highest regardless of the thickness of CD4. The calculations show that the formation and desorption of anionic species at a distance of 16 &#197; from the substrate, which is equivalent to the thickness of CD4 films of four monolayers, are not influenced by the short-range interactions between the substrate and the molecule and DEA products.</description>
