      <title>The NOMAD mini-apps: A suite of kernels from ab initio electronic structure codes enabling co-design in high-performance computing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.16920.3</link>
      <description>Isidre Mas Magre, Rogeli Grima Torres, Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a, Jos&#233; Julio Guti&#233;rrez Moreno, Open Research Europe. 4(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409333649

                This article introduces a suite of mini-applications (mini-apps) designed to optimise computational kernels in ab initio electronic structure codes. The suite is developed from flagship applications participating in the NOMAD Center of Excellence, such as the ELPA eigensolver library and the GW implementations of the exciting, Abinit, and FHI-aims codes. The mini-apps were identified by targeting functions that significantly contribute to the total execution time in the parent applications. This strategic selection allows for concentrated optimisation efforts. The suite is designed for easy deployment on various High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, supported by an integrated CMake build system for straightforward compilation and execution. The aim is to harness the capabilities of emerging (post)exascale systems, which necessitate concurrent hardware and software development &#8212; a concept known as co-design. The mini-app suite serves as a tool for profiling and benchmarking, providing insights that can guide both software optimisation and hardware design. Ultimately, these developments will enable more accurate and efficient simulations of novel materials, leveraging the full potential of exascale computing in material science research.</description>

      <title>Dual Metal Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C Sites with Improved Stability for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell</title>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost and durable hydrogen fuel cells are crucial for the success of the hydrogen economy. While Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts are amongst the most promising low&#8208;cost alternative to platinum (Pt) for the oxygen reduction reaction, their unsatisfactory durability is the grand challenge faced by the field due to iron demetallation, carbon corrosion and electrode collapse. Herein, a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst with superior stability (49% loss in peak power density) than Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts (66% loss) over 96 h of continuous operations in H 2 &#8211;O 2 fuel cells is reported. Advanced operando electrochemical and post&#8208;mortem physical measurements shed light on the underlying mechanism. The iron&#8211;manganese bond anchors the iron strongly in the Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C centre, which lowers the hydrogen peroxide yield as a result. Operando electrochemical measurements reveal a more stable triple&#8208;phase boundary environment for the Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst than for Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. Specifically, a combination of cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy with the distribution of relaxation times reveals that the iron demetallation and carbon corrosion are respectively 20% and 30% slower for the Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst than the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells. Altogether, this dual&#8208;metal site strategy paves the way for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells.</description>

      <title>Role of Water in Green Carbon Science</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c00347</link>
      <description>Bo Peng, Kun Zhang, Yuhan Sun, Buxing Han, Mingyuan He, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409348887

                Within the context of green chemistry, the concept of green carbon science emphasizes carbon balance and recycling to address the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality. The fundamental processes in this field are oxidation and reduction, which often involve simple molecules such as CO2, CO, CH4, CHx, and H2O. Water plays a critical role in nearly all oxidation-reduction processes, and thus, it is a central focus of research in green carbon science. Water can act as a direct source of dihydrogen in reduction reactions or participate in oxidation reactions, frequently involving O-O coupling to produce hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen. At the atomic level, this coupling involves the statistically unfavorable proximity of two atoms, requiring optimization through a catalytic process influenced by two types of factors, as described by the authors. Extrinsic factors are related to geometrical and electronic criteria associated with the catalytic metal, involving its d-orbitals (or bands in the case of zerovalent metals and electrodes). Intrinsic factors are related to the coupling of oxygen atoms via their p-orbitals. At the mesoscopic or microscopic scale, the reaction medium typically consists of mixtures of lipophilic and hydrophilic phases with water, which may exist under supercritical conditions or as suspensions of microdroplets. These reactions predominantly occur at phase interfaces. A comprehensive understanding of the phenomena across these scales could facilitate improvements and even lead to the development of novel conversion processes.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Selectivity in Oxygen Electrocatalysis Using Chiral Nanoparticles as Electron-Spin Filters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c03394</link>
      <description>Zixu Wang, Jinling Wan, Xuehao Sun, Lichao Sun, Shengli Chen, Qingfeng Zhang, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409350393

                Controlling the electron spin of oxygen-containing intermediates is crucial for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis toward clean energy technologies such as fuel cells and water electrolysis. Current strategies for controlling the electron spins rely mainly on tuning the chemical structure of the oxygen electrocatalyst, which is often hardly achieved for metal and oxide electrocatalysts. The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a significant discovery in chiral spintronics, represents an alternative approach for tuning the spin selectivity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Here we demonstrate the use of intrinsic chiral nanoparticles as electron-spin filters to tune the selectivity in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Chiral Au nanoparticles with a concave vortex cube structure were employed as the chiral substrate, exhibiting highly tunable optical chirality and intriguing CISS-like effect. As model systems, the catalytically active components such as Pt or Ni(OH)2 are overgrown onto chiral Au nanoparticles to construct the chiral hybrid electrocatalysts. Remarkably, both cases show chirality-dependent tunable activities over oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, respectively. The insights gained from this work not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms dictating the CISS-enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis by chiral nanoparticles but also provide an important knowledge framework that guides the rational design of chiral electrocatalysts toward oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Diffusion power spectra as a window into dynamic materials architecture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt6144</link>
      <description>S Fricke, Mia Salgado, Shira Haber, J&#233;r&#233;my Demarteau, Mutian Hua, Ah&#8208;Young Song, Brett A. Helms, Jeffrey A. Reimer, Science Advances. 11(15)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409357139

                Chemical recycling of commodity and specialty polymers presents a multifaceted challenge for industrial societies. On one hand, macromolecular architectures must be engineered to yield durable products that, on the other hand, rapidly deconstruct to recyclable monomers under pre-determined conditions. Polymer deconstruction is a chemical process that requires deep understanding of molecular reactivity in heterogeneous media, where porous material architectures evolve in both space and time. To build this understanding, we develop herein experimental and analytical methods describing sets of diffusive eigenmodes that exist within time-varying, non-Euclidean boundary conditions, a situation commonly encountered in the reactive deconstruction of polymers where chain fragments splay, alter their local dynamics, and evolve in their confinement of reacting media. Diffusion power spectra, discerned experimentally by NMR, yield polymer and solvent frequency-domain velocity autocorrelation functions that are analyzed in the context of physical models for chemical reactions parameterized with fractal mathematics. The results connect local motion in polymers to chemical reactivity during acidolysis of circular elastomers.</description>

      <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202503221</link>
      <description>Hao Zhao, Baoxin Ni, Yongyu Pan, Yuze Li, Jun Li, Guo&#8208;Liang Wang, Zhiqing Zou, Kun Jiang, Qing&#8208;Qing Cheng, Lianhai Zu, Hui Yang, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409361094

                Abstract Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate ( * H bridge ) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc &#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru( fcc )) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring * H bridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to * H bridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and high turnover frequency (56.4 H 2 s &#8722;1 at 50 mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ug Pt cm &#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61 V at 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 ) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h &#8722;1 over 1000 h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80 &#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58 V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm &#8722;2 . This finding highlights the key role of * H bridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.</description>

      <title>Pt 5d Density of States in Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst Governed by Ligand Effect</title>

                In alloy systems, the strain and ligand effects are prevalent, but it is challenging to study the impact of either on the material structure independently. We conducted high-energy-resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES)/resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy on a Pt3Mg alloy-based carbon material (Pt3Mg-N-C). By introducing a size-comparable atom, the strain effect is minimized, allowing the Pt d-density of states (d-DOS) to be primarily affected by the ligand effect. The experimental results reveal that Pt gains electrons in Pt3Mg-N-C, exhibiting a more symmetric d-band shape and a downshift of the d-band center compared to Pt metal, which is further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The correlation between the Pt d-DOS and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Wiggle150: Benchmarking Density Functionals and Neural Network Potentials on Highly Strained Conformers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00015</link>

                Accurate benchmarks are key to assessing the accuracy and robustness of computational methods, yet most available benchmark sets focus on equilibrium geometries, limiting their utility for applications involving nonequilibrium structures such as ab initio molecular dynamics and automated reaction-path exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Wiggle150, a benchmark comprising 150 highly strained conformations of adenosine, benzylpenicillin, and efavirenz. These geometries&#9472;generated via metadynamics and scored using DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS reference energies&#9472;exhibit substantially larger deviations in bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and relative energies than other conformer benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse array of computational methods, including density-functional theory, composite quantum chemical methods, semiempirical models, neural network potentials, and force fields, on predicting relative energies for this challenging benchmark set. The results highlight multiple methods along the speed-accuracy Pareto frontier and identify AIMNet2 as particularly robust among the NNPs surveyed. We anticipate that Wiggle150 will be used to validate computational protocols involving nonequilibrium systems and guide the development of new density functionals and neural network potentials.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Understanding of &lt;scp&gt;LaTaON&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/scp&gt; Decorated With Metal Cocatalysts for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.70047</link>
      <description>Xiang Zhang, Yue Liu, Xin Zhou, International Journal of Quantum Chemistry. 125(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409372862

                ABSTRACT LaTaON 2 is a promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst for water splitting because of its broad visible light absorption and suitable band edge positions. However, the high defect concentration hinders the charge transfer and results in the poor photocatalytic performance of LaTaON 2 . Loading proper cocatalysts is one of the most efficient strategies for promoting charge separation/transfer and achieving high reaction activity. In this work, we have used density functional theory calculations to study the depositions of Pt, Ru, and Ni single atom cocatalysts on LaTaON 2 (010) surface. The most stable adsorption configuration is the same site for all the elements, namely the top of the N atom on the La&#8208;terminated surface and the fourfold hollow site on the Ta&#8208;terminated surface. The adsorption of the metal single atom on Ta&#8208;termination is stronger than that on La&#8208;termination due to the formation of more bonds. Upon the deposition, no localized impurity states appear in the middle of the forbidden gap since the n d states of metal adatoms are located within the valence band and conduction band of LaTaON 2 . The efficiency of the photocatalysts is probed by investigating their ability to adsorb the H atom in a thermodynamically favorable manner. Our results reveal that the energetically favorable sites of HER are the N atom on the La&#8208;termination and the O and N atoms on the Ta&#8208;termination, respectively. Compared with the clean surface, the surfaces with Pt, Ru, and Ni single adatoms exhibit higher performance for HER because loading metal cocatalysts can further activate the surface nonmetal atoms and reduce the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption. The work gives an atom&#8208;level insight into the role of metal single atom cocatalysts in the LaTaON 2 photocatalyst for hydrogen production.</description>

                Developing ruthenium-based oxide catalysts capable of suppressing lattice oxygen participation in the catalytic reaction process is crucial for maintaining stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under acidic conditions. Herein, we delicately construct a RuO2 nanoparticle-anchored LiCoO2 nanosheet electrocatalyst (RuO2/LiCoO2), achieving dynamic optimization of RuO2 during the reaction process and improving catalytic stability. Benefiting from the unique electrochemical delithiation characteristics of the LiCoO2 support, the covalency of the Ru-O bond is effectively regulated during the OER process. The weakened Ru-O covalent bond inhibits the participation of lattice oxygen in the catalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the Ru active sites. Moreover, the extended Ru-O bond in the optimized RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst reduces the formation energy barrier of the *OOH intermediates, accelerating the progress of the OER. As a result, the RuO2/LiCoO2 catalyst requires only an overpotential of 150 &#177; 2 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and operates stably for 2000 h at 1 A cm-2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. This work opens new avenues for designing efficient ruthenium-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Assessment of CO2 Sequestration in a Stack Storage Complex in the San Juan Basin, NM</title>

                ABSTRACT Effective CO2 sequestration requires not only minimizing carbon emissions but also optimizing storage efficiency while ensuring the integrity of storage sites. This research focuses on the assessment of CO2 injection in a stack storage system, specifically targeting the Entrada (high-permeability) and Bluff (low-permeability) formations within the San Juan Basin. By leveraging a single well to inject CO2 across multiple formations, the goal is to enhance storage efficiency, reduce the spatial extent of CO2 plumes, and minimize the area requiring long-term monitoring. A high-resolution hydrodynamic reservoir model was developed and validated using historical injection rates and pressure data from nearby saltwater disposal wells. This model was used to simulate 30 years of CO2 injection, aiming to store 50MtCO2f through a stacked storage configuration. Three well-completion strategies were explored: (1) a base case with injection into Entrada only, (2) a case with commingled injection into both formations through a single well, and (3) 6 scenarios using smart well-completion techniques to simultaneously inject CO2 into the Entrada and Bluff formations at controlled rates. Different injection rates were tested to identify the best scenario that minimizes CO2 plume size while meeting the storage target. Simulation results from the base case of injecting into Entrada only revealed that at an injection rate of 80MMSCFD, 50MtCO2 can be injected over 30 years. The commingled injection case showed that over 90% of injected CO2 entered the Entrada formation, leading to larger plume size (64.69 square miles after 100 years of post-injection monitoring) and an expanded area requiring monitoring. In contrast, the optimized injection strategy, with CO2 allocated at varying rates (25%, 31%, and 34% of the total injection rate of 80MMSCD) to the Bluff formation, resulted in the best scenario case significantly reducing the Entrada plume spatial extent by 22% while increasing the plume size in the Bluff formation by approximately 94%, accompanied by a 77% increment in the storage capacity. Ultimately, the best scenario reduced the total area requiring monitoring, demonstrating the effectiveness of a stack storage approach in controlling CO2 migration and pressure fronts. This study highlights the importance of optimizing CO2 in stacked storage systems to maximize sequestration efficiency. By carefully managing injection rates, the spread of CO2 plumes can be controlled, reducing monitoring costs and ensuring safe, long-term storage. The findings provide valuable insights for improving the practical implementation of CO2 capture and storage projects using stack storage systems.</description>

                Under mild conditions, the effective conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (HCOOH) and carbon monoxide (CO) represents a promising avenue for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and addressing energy crises. In this work, we analyzed the electro-catalytic activities of six metals (Ti, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cr) anchored on monolayer molybdenum telluride (TM@MoTe2) for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from CO2 to HCOOH and CO. Compared to the reversible hydrogen electrode, the limiting potential for HCOOH production on Ni@MoTe2 is only about &#8722;0.38 V, and it is only about &#8722;0.20 V for the CO production on Cu@MoTe2. The limiting potential is concerned with the free energies of *OCHO and *COOH. Both the CO2RRs suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and exhibit good selectivity for the desired reaction products. These features enable the efficient conversion of CO2 into HCOOH on Ni@MoTe2 or CO on Cu@MoTe2. Our calculations could provide valuable insights for the design and synthesis of high-performance catalysts based on MoTe2.</description>

                Modeling complex materials using high-fidelity, ab initio methods at low cost is a fundamental goal for quantum chemical software packages. The GW approximation and random phase approximation (RPA) provide a unified description of both electronic structure and total energies using the same physics in a many-body perturbative approach that can be more accurate than generalized-gradient density functional theory (DFT) methods. However, GW/RPA implementations have historically been limited to either specific materials classes or application toward small chemical systems. The static subspace approximation allows for reduced cost full-frequency GW/RPA calculations and has previously been benchmarked thoroughly for GW calculations. Here, we describe our approach to including partial occupations of electronic orbitals in full-frequency GW and RPA calculations for the study of electrocatalysts. We benchmarked RPA total energy calculations using the subspace approximation across a diverse test suite of materials for a variety of computational parameters. The benchmarking quantifies the impact of different extrapolation procedures for representing the static polarizability at infinite screened cutoff, and shows that using screened cutoffs above 20-25 Ryd result in diminishing accuracy returns for predicting RPA total energies. Additionally, for moderately sized electrocatalytic models, 2-3 times fewer computational resources are used to compute RPA total energies by representing the static polarizability with 20-30% of the static subspace basis, with an error of approximately 0.01 eV or better in RPA adsorption energy calculations. Finally, we show that for these electrochemical models RPA can shift DFT adsorption energy shifts by up to 0.5 eV and that GW can frequently shift DFT eigenvalues of surface and adsorbate states by approximately 0.5-1 eV.</description>

                Potential-induced electrode charging is a prerequisite to initiate electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The 'interface space charge' could dramatically alter the reaction environment and the charge density of the active site, both of which potentially affect the electrochemical activity. However, our understanding of the electrocatalytic role of space charge has been limited. Here, we separately modulate the amount of space charge (characterized by the areal density, &#963;) with maintaining the electrochemical potential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the same level, by exploiting the unique structural feature of MeNC. We reveal that changes in &#963; control the ORR activity, which is computationally explained by the inductive polarization of the charge density at the active sites, affecting their turnover rates. To guide catalyst design including the space charge effect, we develop a new descriptor, explaining the activity trend in various metal centers and pH conditions using a single volcano. These findings offer fresh insights into the role of space charge in electrocatalysis, providing a new framework for optimizing catalyst design and performance.</description>

                Abstract Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) are versatile materials with tuneable properties. They show promising electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalytic activity in the activation and conversion of CO 2 . Their unique properties make LDHs pivotal materials in emerging sustainable strategies for mitigating the effect of CO 2 emissions. However, the intricate structure&#8208;property relationship inherent to LDHs challenges their rational design. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of both experimental and computational studies about LDHs for photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalytic conversion of CO 2 , mainly focusing on Cu&#8208;based systems due to their superior performance in producing C 2 products. We present a background framework, describing the essentials computational and experimental tools, designed to support both experimentalists and theoreticians in the development of tailored LDH materials for efficient and sustainable CO 2 valorisation. Finally, we discuss future potential advancements, emphasizing the importance of new synergistic experimental&#8208;computational studies.</description>

                Achieving both robust extrapolation and physical interpretability in machine learning interatomic potentials (ML-IPs) for atomistic simulation remains a significant challenge, particularly in data-scarce areas such as chemical reactions or complex, multicomponent materials at extreme conditions. Here, we present a pairwise-decomposed physics-informed neural network (P2Net) that parametrizes an analytical bond-order potential (BOP) layer to decouple the energy contributions of atomic pairs. By leveraging fundamental physical principles, P2Net demonstrates excellence at extrapolating beyond its training regime and accurately capturing molecular geometries far from equilibrium. The pairwise energy decomposition further empowers the bond analyses for deprotonation and SN2 reactions, which is not easy with most ML-IPs. The atomic pair energy offers how to elucidate the evolution of interatomic interactions as a reaction proceeds. Our methodology highlights enhanced data efficiency in building ML-IPs and facilitates more informative postsimulation analysis, thereby broadening the applicability of ML-IPs to complex and reactive systems.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Time-Resolved X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy Unveils Partial Re-Oxidation of Tellurium Cluster for Prolonged Lifespan in Hydrogen Evolution</title>

                Efficient and long-lasting electrocatalysts are one of the key factors in determining their large-scale commercial viability. Although the fundamentals of deactivation and regeneration of electrocatalysts are crucial for understanding and sustaining durable activity, little has been conducted on metalloids compared to metal-derived ones. Herein, by virtue of in situ seconds-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we discovered the chemical evolution during the deactivation-regeneration cycles of tellurium clusters supported by nitrogen-doped carbon (termed Te-ACs@NC) as a high-performance electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through in situ electrochemical reduction, Te-ACs@NC, which had been deactivated due to surface phase transitions in a previous HER process, was reactivated and regenerated for the next run, where partially oxidized Te was found, surprisingly, to perform better than its nonoxidized state. After 10 consecutive deactivation-regeneration cycles over 480 h, the Te-ACs@NC retained 85% of its initial catalytic activity. Theoretical studies suggest that local oxidation modulates the electronic distribution within individual Te clusters to optimize the adsorption energy of water molecules and reduce dissociation energy. This study provides fundamental insights into the rarely explored metalloid cluster catalysts during deactivation and regeneration and will assist in the future design and development of supported catalysts with high activity and long durability.</description>

                Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the key step for energy conversion in electrocatalysis. Atomic-scale simulation acts as an indispensable tool to provide a microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the quantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical constant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to explicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient grand canonical sampling, further assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical conditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET simulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a physical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring protons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET paths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to classical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of NQEs may reshape our fundamental understanding of other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios of energy conversion processes.</description>

                FeM (M = Se, Te) chalcogenides have been well studied as promising magnets and superconductors, yet their potential as electrocatalysts is often considered limited due to anion dissolution and oxidation during electrochemical reactions. Here, we show that by using two-dimensional (2D) FeTeSe nanosheets, these conventionally perceived limitations can be leveraged to enable the reaction-driven in-situ generation of anisotropic in-plane tensile and out-of-plane compressive strains during the alkaline low-concentration nitrate reduction reaction (NO3-RR). The reconstructed catalyst demonstrates enhanced performance, yielding ammonia with a near-unity Faradaic efficiency and a high yield rate of 42.14 &#177; 2.06 mg h-1 mgcat-1. A series of operando synchrotron-based X-ray measurements and ex-situ characterizations, alongside theoretical calculations, reveal that strain formation is ascribed to chalcogen vacancies created by partial Se/Te leaching, which facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of OH-/NO3- from the electrolyte, resulting in an O(H)-doped strained lattice. Combined electrochemical and computational investigations suggest that the superior catalytic performance arises from the synergistic contributions from the exposed strained Fe sites and surface hydroxyl groups. These findings highlight the potential of 2D transition metal chalcogenides for in-situ structural engineering during electrochemical reactions to enhance catalytic activity for NO3-RR and beyond.</description>

      <title>A charge calibration strategy for describing the charge transfer during the electrochemical elementary step</title>

                Constant potential modeling of electrocatalytic processes remains a significant challenge in the field of computational catalysis, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously considering the influence of constant potential conditions, explicit solvent environment, and the double-layer structure. In this work, we propose a charge calibration strategy for electrocatalytic processes. This strategy accounts for charge transfer in systems with explicit solvation and ions during constant-potential free energy modeling. In our strategy, interfacial counter-ions are employed to model the Helmholtz layer and determine the surface charge density, which defines the electrode potential. During the simulation of electrochemical reactions, extra charges are introduced/extracted to/from the system to compensate for electron transfer between the electrode and the reaction species and keep a constant surface charge density along the reaction profile. Our method showcases the impact of potential-dependent solvent reorganization on reaction kinetics and underscores the importance of constant potential kinetics. We anticipate that the strategy presented here will inspire further theoretical and experimental studies for electrochemistry interfaces.</description>

                The d orbital physics are closely related to the catalytic activity of transition-metal-based catalysts in Li-S batteries. However, challenges remain in understanding the optimal electronic configuration, causing a lack of guidance in the precise design of catalysts. Herein, by virtue of LaCoO3-based catalysts with different combinations of low-spin states and high-spin states of Co3+, a volcano relationship between dz2 filling number (from 0.95 to 1.29) and S/Li2S redox reaction kinetics is revealed. The best kinetics are provided at the dz2 filling number of 1.12. As a result, the assembled Li-S battery shows a low decay rate of 0.026% per cycle in a 1500-cycle test and a high energy density of 460.7 Wh kg-1 in a practical pouch cell. This work reveals the critical influences of dz2 electronic states on catalyzing the S/Li2S redox reaction and provides insights into finely regulating the electronic structures of high-performance catalysts for practical Li-S batteries.</description>

                Electronic absorption spectra serve as versatile and powerful tools in experiments. Accurate theoretical simulation of electronic absorption spectra is challenging because multiple factors such as environmental effects and nuclear quantum effects contribute to spectrum lineshapes. This work proposes a protocol to model electronic absorption spectra in the constrained nuclear&#8211;electronic orbital framework. Solvent effects, temperature effects, and particularly nuclear quantum effects can be taken into consideration in this unified framework. This protocol is applied to investigate the electronic absorption spectrum of the pyridine molecule in water. Nuclear quantum effects are found to induce a broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum of pyridine.</description>

                Abstract The rising demand for sustainable green hydrogen production necessitates efficient and cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts. Inspired by the catalytic activities of columbite&#8208;tantalite, this study combines a scalable cutting&#8208;edge synthesis approach with atomic&#8208;level structures and metal&#8208;center&#8208;mediated mechanisms to unravel its operational performance and stability. Using ad in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure combined with Density Functional Theory (DFT), the results reveal distinctive valence band peaks and moderate charge transfer from Mn and Fe sites, enabling stable adsorption and reduced activation barriers. In contrast, the high&#8208;valence Nb and Ta centers at the B&#8208;sites promote favorable d &#8208;band alignment, enhancing orbital overlap with oxygen p&#8208; orbitals. This facilites electronic delocalization, lowers charge accumulation, and reduces activation barriers of intermediates species. Fe and Mn at the A&#8208;sites exhibit strong redox reactivity and optimal adsorption for OH* and O*, supporting efficient electron fransfers. Solvation effects modeled via VASPsol further stabilize key intermediates, especially O*, reducing the energy barrier for water dissociation. Notably, FeMn(NbTa) 2 O 6 &#8208;columbite catalysts stand out with a cell voltage of 1.81 V at a current density of 700 mA cm &#8722;2 , compared to 40% Pt/C&#8208;RuO&#8322; (1.75 V) at the same current density in the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Also, the FeMn(NbTa) 2 O 6 &#8208;columbite exhibits long&#8208;term stability at 800 mA cm &#8722;2 , surpassing the benchmark 40% Pt Vulcan&#8208;RuO 2 after 200 h in AEMWE. This work significantly advances current research and establishes a design rule for selecting metal compositions in the development of advanced electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Mild-Condition Conversion of Methane to Acetic Acid over MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Confined Rh&#8211;Fe Sites</title>

                The oriented conversion of CH4 to CH3COOH at low temperature, even room temperature, is both scientifically significant and industrially applicable for CH4 utilization, yet it is extremely challenging due to the difficulties associated with efficient CH4 activation and controllable C-C coupling. In this study, we for the first time achieve the room-temperature conversion of CH4 to CH3COOH using molecular O2 and CO over MoS2-confined Rh-Fe sites, which delivers an unprecedented CH3COOH selectivity of 90.3% and a productivity of 26.2 &#956;mol gcat.-1 h-1 at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, the productivity of CH3COOH can be enhanced to 105.6 &#956;mol gcat.-1 h-1 at 80 &#176;C, while maintaining a high selectivity of 95.6%. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation reveal the critical role of Rh-Fe synergy in the selective formation of CH3COOH. The confined Fe sites in MoS2 enable the activation of O2 to generate highly reactive Fe&#9552;O center for CH4 dissociation to CH3 species at room temperature, which then readily couple with adsorbed CO on adjacent Rh sites to form the key CH3CO intermediate for CH3COOH production. The unique structure of Rh-Fe sites offers synergistic catalytic properties that effectively balance C-H activation and C-C coupling, successfully addressing the trade-off between activity and selectivity in the carbonylation of CH4 to CH3COOH under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation-Facilitated Spontaneous N-O Cleavage Mechanism for Effectively Boosting Nitrate Reduction Reaction on Fe2B2 MBene</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of toxic nitrate wastewater to green fuel ammonia under mild conditions has become a goal that researchers have relentlessly pursued. Existing designed electrocatalysts can effectively promote the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), but the study of the catalytic mechanism is not extensive enough, resulting in no breakthroughs in performance. In this study, a novel mechanism of hydrogenation-facilitated spontaneous N-O cleavage was explored based on density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the Ead&#8722;*OH (adsorption energy of the adsorbed *OH) was used as a key descriptor for predicting the occurrence of spontaneous N-O bond cleavage. We found that Ead&#8722;*OH &lt; &#8722;0.20 eV results into spontaneous N-O bond cleavage. However, excessively strong adsorption of OH* hinders the formation of water. To address this challenge, we designed the eligible Fe2B2 MBene, which shows excellent catalytic activity with an ultra-low limiting potential for NO3RR of &#8722;0.22 V under this novel reaction mechanism. Additionally, electron-deficient Fe active sites could inhibit competing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), which provides high selectivity. This work may offer valuable insights for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</description>
