                Mixed-anion compounds have recently attracted attention as solid-state materials that exhibit properties unattainable with those of their single-anion counterparts. However, the use of mixed-anion compounds to control the morphology and engineer the crystal facets of electrocatalysts has been limited because their synthesis method is still immature.

      <title>An Analysis of the Conceptual and Functional Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering8060116</link>

                Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. The proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits, such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of the layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half-reaction (known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) and cathodic half-reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current study aims to present these parameters and discuss their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalysts and minimize catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative noble metals that could be used as electrocatalysts in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.</description>

      <title>Potassium and Boron Co-Doping of g-C3N4 Tuned CO2 Reduction Mechanism for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance: A First-Principles Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29225339</link>
      <description>Gang Fu, Wenqing Zhen, Hongyi Wang, Xin Zhou, Li Yang, Jiaxu Zhang, Molecules. 29(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404331595

                Graphitic phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4, abbreviated as CN) can be used as a photocatalyst to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, there is still potential for improvement in the small band gap and carrier migration properties of intrinsic materials. K-B co-doped CN (KBCN) was investigated as a promising photocatalyst for carbon dioxide reduction via the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The electronic and optical properties of CN and KBCN indicate that doping K and B can improve the catalytic performance of CN by promoting charge migration and separation. In terms of the Gibbs free energy change, the CO2 reduction reaction catalysed by KBCN results in CH3OH, and its optimal pathway is CO2 &#8594; *CO2 &#8594; *COOH &#8594; CO &#8594; *OCH &#8594; HCHO &#8594; *OCH3 &#8594; CH3OH. Compared with CN, the doping elements K and B shift the rate-determining step from CO2 &#8594; *CO2 to *CO2 &#8594; *COOH. The K and B elements co-doping tuned the charge distribution between the catalyst and the adsorbate and reduced the Gibbs free energy of the rate-determining step from 1.571 to 0.861 eV, suggesting that the CO2 reduction activity of KBCN is superior to that of CN. Our work provides useful insights for the design of metallic&#8211;nonmetallic co-doped CN for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2PR) reactions.</description>

                The thermodynamic features and mechanism of the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction were studied using the revPBE0-D3(BJ)/Def2-TZVP method on the example of (6,6)-armchair carbon nanotube doped with a tricoordinated silicon atom and nitrogen atoms of pyridinic and graphitic nature. Irreversible oxidation of the silicon center as a result of the formation of stable oxygen-containing adsorbates was shown. It was found that Si-poisoned structures are capable of participating in the catalysis of the target reaction along two- and four-electron routes at high overpotentials. For a nanotube doped simultaneously with pyridinic and graphitic nitrogens the potential possibility of eliminating the silicon atom from the catalyst composition in the form of orthosilicic acid and the participation of a silicon-free nitrogen-doped framework in the oxygen electroreduction reaction, for which the stage of tautomerization of pyridin-2(1H)-one to pyridin-2-ol is the limiting step was shown.</description>

                Abstract We develop an automated high-throughput workflow for calculating lattice dynamical properties from first principles including those dictated by anharmonicity. The pipeline automatically computes interatomic force constants (IFCs) up to 4th order from perturbed training supercells, and uses the IFCs to calculate lattice thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and vibrational free energy and entropy. It performs phonon renormalization for dynamically unstable compounds to obtain real effective phonon spectra at finite temperatures and calculates the associated free energy corrections. The methods and parameters are chosen to balance computational efficiency and result accuracy, assessed through convergence testing and comparisons with experimental measurements. Deployment of this workflow at a large scale would facilitate materials discovery efforts toward functionalities including thermoelectrics, contact materials, ferroelectrics, aerospace components, as well as general phase diagram construction.</description>

                Abstract The combination of different elements in alloy catalysts can lead to improved activity as it provides opportunities to tune the electronic structures of surface atoms. However, the synthesis and performance screening of alloy catalysts through a vast chemical space are cost&#8208; and labor&#8208;intensive. Herein, a UV&#8208;induced, high&#8208;throughput method is reported for the synthesis and screening of alloy electrocatalysts in a fast and low&#8208;cost manner. A platform that integrates 37 mini&#8208;reaction&#8208;cells enables simultaneous UV&#8208;induced photodeposition of alloy nanoparticles with up to 37 compositions. These mini&#8208;reaction&#8208;cells further allow a transfer&#8208;free, high&#8208;throughput electrochemical performance screening. Binary (PtPd, PtIr, PdIr), ternary (PtPdIr, PtRuIr) and quaternary (PtPdRuIr) alloys have been synthesized with the activity of the binary alloys (57 compositions) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) being screened. The predicted high performance of identified alloy compositions are subsequently validated by standard measurements using a rotating disk electrode configuration. It is found that the as&#8208;synthesized alloy nanoparticles are rich in twin boundaries and thus possess lattice strain. Density functional theory calculation implies that the high ORR activity of the screened Pt 0.75 Pd 0.25 alloy originates from the interplay between the differentiated adsorption sites because of alloying and the strain&#8208;induced modulation of the d&#8208;band center.</description>

                Abstract Engineering metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8210;O) interactions for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tuning the coordination geometry of metal sites is crucial for improving catalytic performance, which remains unexplored, especially in structurally diverse phosphate&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, two NaCoPO 4 (NCP) polymorphs with distinct metal coordinations: orthorhombic&#8208; Pnma (CoO 6 ) and hexagonal&#8208;P 6 5 (CoO 4 ) denoted as O&#8208;NCP and H&#8208;NCP, respectively are synthesized through unique quenching&#8208;based synthesis, to investigate the impact of coordination geometry on M&#8210;O covalency and OER performance. The CoO 4 (H&#8208;NCP) polymorph delivered superior OER activity with low overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 (&#951; 10 = 303 mV) and long&#8208;term stability than CoO 6 &#8208;based O&#8208;NCP. Spectroscopic and computational studies linked the superior activity of CoO 4 to higher Co&#8210;O covalency, enhanced metal electronic states near the Fermi level, and improved electrochemical reconstruction. Further, M&#8210;O covalency regulated OER mechanism, where high&#8208;covalent CoO 4 follows conventional concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer pathway, while CoO 6 entails a non&#8208;concerted pathway, where the lattice oxygen participation remains unfavorable due to downshifted O 2p band center. Further, OER&#8208;active tetrahedral metal is demonstrated in a high&#8208;entropy catalyst requiring lower &#951; 10 of &#8776;284 mV.

      <title>Variants of Surface Charges and Capacitances in Electrocatalysis: Insights from Density-Potential Functional Theory Embedded with an Implicit Chemisorption Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/prxenergy.3.043008</link>
      <description>Jun Huang, Fabiola Dom&#237;nguez-Flores, Marko Melander, PRX Energy. 3(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404414084

                Prevalent electrolyte effects across a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions underscore the general importance of the local reaction conditions in the electrical double layer (EDL). Compared to traditional EDLs, the electrocatalytic siblings feature partially charged chemisorbates that could blur our long-held views of surface charge densities and differential capacitances&#8212;two interrelated quantities shaping the crucial local reaction conditions. Herein, five variants of surface charge density and three variants of differential capacitance in the presence of chemisorbates are defined and compared. A semiclassical model of electrocatalytic EDLs is developed for a quantitative analysis of the differences and interrelationships between these variants of surface charge densities and differential capacitances. It is revealed that the potential- and concentration-dependent net charge on these chemisorbates dramatically changes the surface charge densities and differential capacitances. Specifically, the free surface charge density could decrease as the electrode potential becomes more positive, implying that the . The relationship between the free and total surface charge densities is analyzed with aid of the concept of electrosorption valency. By linking the electrosorption valency with the differential capacitance in the absence of chemisorbates, we explain the potential and concentration dependence of the former. The conceptual analysis presented in this work has important implications for experimental characterization and first-principles-based atomistic simulations of electrocatalysis and EDL effects. Particularly, we disclose a hidden yet potentially crucial disadvantage of widely employed atomistic simulation models that fix the coverage of chemisorbates. Proposing the self-consistent implicit model as an expedient remedy for this disadvantage, this work contributes to more realistic modeling of electrocatalytic EDLs.

                Abstract Transition metal borides (TMBs) are a new class of promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation by water splitting. However, the synthesis of robust all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrodes is challenging for practical applications. Herein, a facile solid&#8208;state boronization strategy is reported to synthesize a series of self&#8208;supported TMBs thin films (TMB&#8208;TFs) with large area and high catalytic activity. Among them, MoB thin film (MoB&#8208;TF) exhibits the highest activity toward electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), displaying a low overpotential ( &#951; 10 = 191 and 219 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and a small Tafel slope (60.25 and 61.91 mV dec &#8722;1 ) in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, it outperforms the commercial Pt/C at the high current density region, demonstrating potential applications in industrially electrochemical water splitting. Theoretical study reveals that both surfaces terminated by TM and B atoms can serve as the active sites and the H* binding strength of TMBs is correlated with the p band center of B atoms. This work provides a new pathway for the potential application of TMBs in large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts for Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Evolution: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225712</link>
      <description>Jing Wen, Siyuan Tang, Xiang Ding, Yin Yin, Fuzhan Song, Xinchun Yang, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404417724

                With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.</description>

      <title>Cu-Supported ZnO under Conditions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Methanol: Why 0.2 ML Coverage?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c02908</link>
      <description>Robert H. Lavroff, Edison Cummings, Kaustubh J. Sawant, Zisheng Zhang, Philippe Sautet, Anastassia N. Alexandrova, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404420877

                By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogeneous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers on the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a subnano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T of 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 of 4.5 atm and CO2 of 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on the surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at a lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, because of the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.</description>

                Abstract We present a comprehensive and user-friendly framework built upon the integrated development environment (IDE), enabling researchers to perform the entire Machine Learning Potential (MLP) development cycle consisting of (i) creating systematic DFT databases, (ii) fitting the Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to empirical potentials or MLPs, and (iii) validating the potentials in a largely automatic approach. The power and performance of this framework are demonstrated for three conceptually very different classes of interatomic potentials: an empirical potential (embedded atom method - EAM), neural networks (high-dimensional neural network potentials - HDNNP) and expansions in basis sets (atomic cluster expansion - ACE). As an advanced example for validation and application, we show the computation of a binary composition-temperature phase diagram for Al-Li, a technologically important lightweight alloy system with applications in the aerospace industry.</description>

                We present BEAST DB, an open-source database comprised of ab initio electrochemical data computed using grand-canonical density functional theory in implicit solvent at consistent calculation parameters. The database contains over 20,000 surface calculations and covers a broad set of heterogeneous catalyst materials and electrochemical reactions. Calculations were performed at self-consistent fixed potential as well as constant charge to facilitate comparisons to the computational hydrogen electrode. This article presents common use cases of the database to rationalize trends in catalyst activity, screen catalyst material spaces, understand elementary mechanistic steps, analyze the electronic structure, and train machine learning models to predict higher fidelity properties. Users can interact graphically with the database by querying for individual calculations to gain a granular understanding of reaction steps or by querying for an entire reaction pathway on a given material using an interactive reaction pathway tool. BEAST DB will be periodically updated, with planned future updates to include advanced electronic structure data, surface speciation studies, and greater reaction coverage.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the Layered-to-Spinel Phase Transformation in Li&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                The phase transition of layered Li0.5NiO2 to spinel Li(NiO2)2 is a potential degradation pathway in LiNiO2-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. We investigated the mechanism of this phase transformation from first principles. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, our results indicate a high energy barrier for the transformation due to high defect formation energies, a complex charge-transfer mechanism, and electronic frustration. Our results suggest that partially inverse spinel phases are unlikely to form for Li0.5NiO2, a qualitative difference from the chemically similar Li0.5MnO2, in which the transformation occurs at room temperature. We show that Ni and Li atoms do not migrate gradually to their respective spinel sites for the layered-to-spinel transformation to occur due to high defect formation energies. We investigated the charge ordering in layered phases along the LiNiO2&#8211;NiO2 composition line, finding a pronounced impact of the symmetry and space group on the layered-to-spinel transition in Li0.5NiO2. Finally, we evaluated the relative stability of different spinel space groups, finding that previously reported experimental observations are consistent with a temperature-averaged structure rather than the 0 K ground-state structure of the Li(NiO2)2 spinel.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is key to realizing a sustainable future for our society. However, the complex interface between electrocatalysts and electrolytes presents an ongoing challenge in electrocatalysis, hindering the accurate identification of effective/authentic structure-activity relationships and determination of favourable reaction mechanisms. Surface coverage and reconstruction analyses of electrocatalysts are important to address each conjecture and/or conflicting viewpoint on surface-active phases and their corresponding electrocatalytic origin,</description>

                Abstract The synthesis of hydrogen via water electrolysis is an important step towards resolving the energy crisis and impeding global warming, as hydrogen can be used as a green energy carrier. The oxygen evolution as one half&#8208;cell reaction (OER) is currently limiting efficient water splitting due to kinetic inhibition as well as a complex mechanism, causing a large overpotential. Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxides (LDH) were found to be suitable OER catalysts, as they are cost effective, stable and highly active. This work focuses on the intercalation of different organic and inorganic borates into the LDH interlayers to study their influence on OER. Besides activity and stability measurements, three borate candidates were chosen for a kinetic study, including steady&#8208;state Tafel analysis and reaction order plots. It was found that the Bockris pathway with the second step as rate&#8208;determining step was predominant for all three catalysts. Of all candidates, the intercalation of borate resulted in the highest performance, which was associated with a high reducibility affecting the active metal sites.</description>

                Abstract Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (Ir SA &#8208;MnO x ) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e &#8722; pathway on high&#8208;valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O &#9472; O coupling. The Ir SA &#8208;MnO x therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635 V) between OER potential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and ORR half&#8208;wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Insight Into Intermediate Behaviors and Design Strategies of Platinum Group Metal&#8208;Based Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) can effectively convert the hydrogen energy through the hydrogen fuel cells, which plays an increasingly important role in the renewable hydrogen cycle. Nevertheless, when the electrolyte pH changes from acid to base, even with platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, the HOR kinetics declines with several orders of magnitude. More critically, the pivotal role of reaction intermediates and interfacial environment during intermediate behaviors on alkaline HOR remains controversial. Therefore, exploring the exceptional PGM&#8208;based alkaline HOR electrocatalysts and identifying the reaction mechanism are indispensable for promoting the commercial development of hydrogen fuel cells. Consequently, the fundamental understanding of the HOR mechanism is first introduced, with emphases on the adsorption/desorption process of distinct reactive intermediates and the interfacial structure during catalytic process. Subsequently, with the guidance of reaction mechanism, the latest advances in the rational design of advanced PGM&#8208;based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh&#8208;based) alkaline HOR catalysts are discussed, focusing on the correlation between the intermediate behaviors and the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, given that the challenges standing in the development of the alkaline HOR, the prospect for the rational catalysts design and thorough mechanism investigation towards alkaline HOR are emphatically proposed.</description>
