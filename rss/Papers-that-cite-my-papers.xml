      <title>Research on Quantum Circuit Learning Models for Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.5c03624</link>
      <description>Yasutaka Nishida, The Journal of Physical Chemistry A. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414543782

                In the past decade, many hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been applied to various industrial fields, reflecting the growing interest in NISQ devices. For example, in the field of chemistry, many studies were conducted to calculate the energies of eigenstates with high precision. However, there is still little research on molecular dynamics using quantum computers, because traditional approaches based on variational quantum algorithms are not suitable for the long-time steps of molecular dynamics. In this study, we propose a quantum circuit learning model that estimates the eigenvalues of a given molecular Hamiltonian for an arbitrary molecular configuration. Our model must first be costly to train; however, once trained, the resulting trained model can eliminate procedures that required variational optimization each time the molecular coordinates are updated in the previous variational approach. By using the proposed model, we demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to perform simple molecular dynamics simulations, such as Langevin dynamics and NVE simulation. We also show several applications of our model inspired by classical machine learning.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Droplet Microfluidic Design Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c06253</link>
      <description>Duc Minh Nguyen, Raymond Kai-YuTong, Ngoc&#8208;Duy Dinh, ACS Omega. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414554088

                Droplet-based microfluidic devices have substantial promise as cost-effective alternatives to current assessment tools in biological research. Moreover, machine learning models that leverage tabular data, including input design parameters and their corresponding efficiency outputs, are increasingly utilized to automate the design process of these devices and to predict their performance. However, these models fail to fully leverage the data presented in the tables, neglecting crucial contextual information, including column headings and their associated descriptions. This study presents &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs, a framework designed for processing and feature extraction, which effectively captures contextual information from tabular data formats. &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs overcomes processing challenges by transforming the content into a linguistic format and leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) for analysis. We evaluate our &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs framework on prediction tasks utilizing publicly available data sets on droplet microfluidics. We demonstrate that our &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs framework can empower deep neural network models to be highly effective and straightforward while minimizing the need for extensive data preprocessing. When combined with LLMs like LLAMA3.1 and DEEPSEEK-R1, deep neural networks achieve marked improvements, lowering the mean absolute error in generation rate by nearly 40%, reducing the root mean squared error in droplet diameter by around 26%, and enhancing regime classification accuracy by over 3% in comparison with prior results. This study lays the foundation for the huge potential applications of LLMs and machine learning in a wider spectrum of microfluidic applications.</description>

                Abstract In this work, we investigate manganese-doped ZnO catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, combining structural characterization, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD confirms that Mn doping preserves the wurtzite ZnO structure while inducing lattice distortions and vibrational shifts indicative of manganese incorporation. XPS analysis reveals that Mn3&#8314; is the dominant surface species, which is confirmed by x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopic measurements. Electrochemically, Mn-doped ZnO exhibits enhanced catalytic performance, with increased limiting current density and slight improvements in onset potential compared to pure ZnO. DFT calculations indicate that, while the overall thermodynamics of peroxide formation remain similar, the incorporation of Mn significantly stabilizes the *&#8211;OOH intermediate, thereby reducing the energy requirement for this key step. Together, these findings demonstrate that manganese doping improves ORR activity by modifying the electronic structure and enhancing reaction kinetics, offering valuable insights for the design of efficient ZnO-based electrocatalysts for selective H&#8322;O&#8322; production.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Dynamics and Electric Double Layer Properties at Pt(100) Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/admi.202500680</link>

                Abstract The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface governs many functional properties and processes, such as reaction rates, efficiency, and selectivity in electrochemical systems, with its structure and physicochemical phenomena being crucial for optimizing energy conversion and storage technologies. Platinum (Pt) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for numerous electrocatalytic reactions. While Pt(111) is extensively studied, atomic&#8208;level insights into interfacial properties of another basic surface, Pt(100), remain unresolved. Here, experimental techniques and first&#8208;principles calculations are utilized to investigate adsorption behavior and adsorbate coverage at varying potentials as well as interfacial entropy in acidic media. The results reveal four voltammetric peak features: below peak I, hydrogen is the predominant adsorbate; between peak II and peak III, a mixed adsorption region with 22% hydroxide and 44% hydrogen forms, while at higher potentials, hydroxide coverage increases. The double&#8208;layer structure is also explored, finding sensitivity of the double&#8208;layer capacitance to electrode surface structure. For the first time, by combining in situ laser&#8208;induced current transient and Raman spectroscopy, two potential values of maximum entropy are identified, indicating enhanced disorder and facilitated charge transfer, supported by disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond network due to increased dangling bonds. These insights guide the rational design of efficient electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in Pt&#8208;based nanostructured materials.</description>

      <title>Computational Design of Pt&#63743;m (M = Au, Ir, Pd, Rh, and Ru) Binary Alloys for Enhanced Ammonia Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202500288</link>

                The electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) shows considerable potential for its applications in waste removal and the production of clean energy. While Pt remains the most investigated catalyst for this reaction, its limitations have prompted research into Pt&#8208;based bimetallic alloys. This study investigates both uniform and mixed PtM (M = Au, Ir, Pd, Rh, and Ru) alloys as catalysts for the AOR using density functional theory (DFT). A systematic selection method is used to choose suitable surfaces for testing. The findings indicate that the Oswin&#8211;Salomon mechanism is preferred across all surfaces for N 2 (g) formation. Additionally, the results demonstrate that mixed alloys exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to uniform alloys for the AOR. It is found that the atoms in the topmost layer of the alloy are the most significant factor in influencing catalytic activity. Furthermore, the linear relationship between the &#8208;band center and adsorption energy of key intermediate *NH 2 is confirmed in this work, highlighting the effect of the secondary metal on the electronic structure of the catalyst. The findings provide theoretical insights for the design of high&#8208;performance Pt alloys for AOR and serve as a general guideline for modulating the reactivity of binary alloys for electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>STEMDiff: A Wavelet&#8208;Enhanced Diffusion Model for Physics&#8208;Informed STEM Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202508266</link>
      <description>Yihui Bao, Xinyi Lu, Yanyan Xia, Zhencheng Ye, Houyang Chen, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414570643

                Abstract Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, yet its widespread application remains constrained by the scarcity of annotated training data. While deep generative models offer a promising solution, they typically struggle to reproduce the complex high&#8208;frequency components that define experimental STEM images. Here, STEMDiff, a conditional diffusion model that transforms simple binary labels derived from crystal structures into realistic STEM images through a physical information embedding strategy, is proposed. By developing a novel Discrete Wavelet Transform&#8208;based skip&#8208;connection architecture, the high&#8208;frequency bias inherent in diffusion models are addressed, enabling the preservation of experimental noise characteristics. This approach generates images that are quantitatively nearly indistinguishable from experimental data (17 fold improvement over previous methods) while retaining ground truth structural information. Fully convolutional networks trained exclusively on these synthetic images achieve high&#8208;precision atomic column detection in experimental STEM images of WSe 2 and graphene, despite the presence of substantial background noise and contamination. This approach effectively eliminates the need for laborious manual annotation, providing a scalable solution to the data bottleneck in STEM image analysis. The principles underlying STEMDiff can extend to other scientific imaging modalities, accelerating advancements in materials design for water treatment.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, Alloying Process, and Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Activity of Highly Stable Ni&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo Nanoparticles with a Face&#8208;Centered Cubic Phase</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202505716</link>

                Abstract Real&#8208;time visualization of alloying evolution is crucial yet challenging for designing and synthesizing face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) nanoalloy catalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a trimetallic fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy is synthesized via topological reduction of NiFeMo layered double hydroxide (LDH) under an Ar/H 2 atmosphere. In situ heating transmission electron microscopy reveals the transforamtion of non&#8208;hexagonal NiFeMo LDH nanosheets into irregular inverse&#8208;spinel Ni 1&#8208;x Mo x Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, eventually forming spherical fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy particles. Furthermore, the NiFeMo nanoalloy demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency of 99.3% and superior intrinsic OER activity compared to NiFe and Ni nanoalloys at a consistent mass loading, due to synergistic metal interactions. The NiFeMo nanoalloy&#8208;modified nickel foam electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, with structural and elemental analyses confirming that the original fcc structure remains intact after long&#8208;term OER testing. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry coupled with isotope labelling experiment illustrates that the OER on NiFeMo nanoalloy proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway. Theoretical calculations suggest that Mo species reduce the potential barriers for *OH intermediate formation, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of Ni active sites in the NiFeMo nanoalloy. This work presents a novel approach for developing advanced trimetallic and high&#8208;entropy nanoalloy OER catalysts.</description>

                We present a response-augmented machine-learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Using &#946;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Monolayer on Ni Electrode with Engineered Oxygen Vacancies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c03585</link>
      <description>Farah Rahman, Abdul Ahad Mamun, Auronno Ovid Hussain, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. 129(38)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414596781

                Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H2) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by integrating a &#946;-MnO2 monolayer onto a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO2(110)/Ni(100)). This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites&#9472;Osub-top and bridge sites&#9472;on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of &#8722;0.015 eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C (&#8722;0.082 eV) and Ir (&#8722;0.08 eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density (J0,c) of OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100) reaches 10&#8211;0.774 Acm&#8211;2, outperforming Pt/C (10&#8211;0.92 Acm&#8211;2) and Ir (10&#8211;1.44 Acm&#8211;2). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential (&#951;a,c) of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm&#8211;2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh&#8211;1cm&#8211;2 at an applied voltage (Vapp) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO2-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Lattice expansion of hybrid perovskite inhibits halogen interstitial generation and enhances solar cell performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63693-8</link>
      <description>Tongtong Lu, Zhiya Dang, Yuqing Luo, Li Yang, Xiaobin Rao, Zhe Zhang, Yuecheng Hu, Zelong Chen, Zihao Li, Urko Petralanda, Jiangsheng Xie, Jiancan Yu, Pingqi Gao, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414601641

                One of the primary challenges for halide perovskite technology lies in its instability. Water is a ubiquitous environmental factor known to induce lattice expansion to perovskite. Lattice expansion has been proven beneficial to perovskite solar cell, but little is known about its role in lattice stability. In this work, we expose perovskites with pre-adsorbed water to vacuum and investigate the evolution of their structure. Our results show that vacuum induces water desorption and results in the removal of lattice expansion. This lattice recovery leads to an increasing lattice distortion, ultimately favoring the formation of halogen trimers in the case of hybrid perovskites. We thus find that the lack of lattice expansion facilitates the generation of defects detrimental to hybrid perovskite devices. Here, we report the crucial role of lattice expansion in preventing degradation of hybrid halide perovskites, which is of critical importance in the context of solar cell fabrication. Water adsorption is known to induce lattice expansion to perovskite. This work reveals that the elimination of lattice expansion causes formation of detrimental defects in hybrid perovskite, highlighting its critical role in lattice stability.</description>

                Abstract Iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) materials are promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet their long&#8208;term stability remains a critical challenge due to the dissolution of Fe&#8208;based active sites and corrosion of the carbon support. Here, a Fe&#8208;Zr dual&#8208;atom carbon&#8208;based catalyst (Fe,Zr&#8208;NC) via a one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state synthesis method is reported. The introduction of atomically dispersed Zr&#8211;N units adjacent to Fe&#8211;N 4 centers creates a dual&#8208;metal coordination structure that modulates the local electronic environment of Fe and weakens * OH adsorption, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step in the ORR process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;Zr synergy positions the catalyst near the apex of the ORR activity volcano. Extended experimental EXAFS confirms a Fe&#8211;Zr distance of &#8776;3.30 &#197;, closely matching the theoretical optimum (&#8776;3.39 &#197;). As a result, Fe, Zr&#8208;NC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential (0.891 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with negligible activity loss over 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, outperforming commercial Pt/C. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, the catalyst delivers a peak power density of 185.7 mW cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for over 453 h. This work highlights the importance of dual&#8208;atom synergy in tuning intermediate binding energies and provides design principles for next&#8208;generation ORR electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Ammonia (NH 3 ) is a globally important commodity for energy storage, carbon&#8208;free energy carrier, and fertilizer production, but its synthesis through the Haber&#8208;Bosch process is energy&#8208;intensive and emits significant amounts of CO 2 . Electrochemical reduction of N 2 under ambient conditions is a green and potentially promising approach for NH 3 synthesis, but is limited by a high energy barrier of the first *N 2 protonation step, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, and lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a newly designed electrocatalyst is reported by bridging B 2 N 2 with an Mn single atom in B/N co&#8208;doped carbon (denoted MnB 2 N 2 /C), which exhibits a highly efficient N 2 reduction reaction (N 2 RR) activity with NH 3 Faradaic efficiency (FE NH3 ) of &#8776;37.15% in the aqueous phase system and good electrocatalytic and material stability. The FE NH3 of the MnB 2 N 2 /C catalyst is &#8776;2.1 times higher than that of the as&#8208;synthesized MnN 4 /C counterpart under the same conditions. In the gas phase system, this MnB 2 N 2 /C catalyst shows a remarkably high NH 3 production rate (87.54 &#181;g mg cat. &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 ) and FE NH3 (45.66%). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the high N 2 RR to NH 3 performance arising from the Mn site and the neighboring B site suppresses the parasitic HER on the Mn sites.</description>

                To tackle the pressing issue of nitrate (NO3&#8211;) pollution in wastewater and simultaneously convert it into ammonia (NH3), Cu nanocluster-modified Rhodium (Rh) single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon were synthesized via pyrolysis of a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) precursor and applied to the electrochemical reduction of nitrate at a low concentration. Structural characterizations (X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) confirmed the coexistence of Rh single atoms and Cu nanoclusters as well as their strong electronic interactions. Mechanistic investigations revealed that Rh sites enhanced *H generation via water dissociation and promoted NO3&#8211; adsorption, thereby facilitating *H transfer and subsequent hydrogenation steps. As a result, the optimized Cu97.5Rh2.5/NC catalyst exhibited outstanding NO3&#8211;RR performance, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84.53%, an NH3 yield rate of 1252.22 &#956;g&#183;h&#8211;1 mgcat&#8211;1 at &#8722;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an NH3 selectivity of 89.13% at &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE, and a NO3&#8211; conversion rate of 93.34% at &#8722;1.1 V vs RHE. This work presents a rational design for atom-economical catalysts, enabling sustainable NH3 electrosynthesis from nitrate-laden wastewater and reducing effluent NO3&#8211;&#8211;N to meet World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water standards.</description>

      <title>Rational Pathways Tuning Facilitates Photoelectrochemical Upcycling of Nitrite to Ammonia Using CuPd Nanoalloy on GaN/Si Photocathode</title>

                Solar-driven photoelectrochemical conversion of nitrite to ammonia represents a sustainable yet unexplored approach for environmental remediation and resource recovery. Here, we demonstrate that Cu5Pd1 alloy nanoparticles, integrated with vertically grown GaN nanowires on an n+-p Si photocathode (Cu5Pd1/GaN/Si), enable highly efficient and selective nitrite reduction to ammonia. This photoelectrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 99.7% for NH3, with a yield rate of 162.2 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 and a nearly 100% selectivity. Additionally, the Cu5Pd1/GaN/Si photoelectrode maintains robust performance in the presence of various anions and can effectively remove &#8764;98% of nitrite even at low concentrations. Density functional theory calculations, supported by in situ spectroscopic techniques, reveal that Cu&#8211;Pd alloying fundamentally alters the nitrite reduction mechanisms. Unlike the *NOH-mediated pathway on Cu and Pd, which can lead to competing N2 formation, the CuPd alloy preferentially stabilizes the *NHO intermediate, making NH3 production thermodynamically preferred and highly selective. These findings highlight that a rational electrocatalyst design can effectively tune reaction pathways to enhance both the efficiency and selectivity of photoelectrocatalytic nitrite upcycling.</description>

      <title>Topological Luttinger-semimetal CoAs3 dye-sensitized photocatalyst for efficient solar hydrogen evolution</title>

                Solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting is a process for hydrogen production from a renewable source. The practical implementation of this technology is limited by the low conversion efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light and the insufficient long-term stability of photocatalysts. Here we demonstrate a dye (Eosin Y)-sensitized photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen production. The topological semimetal CoAs3 achieves a hydrogen production rate of 2688 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 15.2% at &#955; = 500 nm. Efficient photocatalytic activity is attributed to the electronic properties of CoAs3, which facilitate electron transfer at the Eosin Y/CoAs3 interface, determined by transient absorption spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations predict that CoAs3 is a Luttinger semimetal, exhibiting a quadratic band touching point near the Fermi level and an associated topological insulator gap. The carrier mobility of the material facilitates the transfer of injected electrons from the dye to active sites. Herein, we report a topological photocatalyst that exhibits enhanced stability and efficiency for solar hydrogen production. Developing photocatalysts from earth-abundant materials is crucial for sustainable solar hydrogen production, yet challenges in efficiency and stability persist. Here, the authors report that the topological semimetal cobalt triarsenide functions as an active and durable platform for this reaction.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>

                The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation can remain unused. Of the more than 150,000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>

      <title>Hammett-Inspired Product Baseline for Data-Efficient &#916;-ML in Chemical Space</title>

                Data-hungry machine learning methods have become a new standard to efficiently navigate chemical compound space for molecular and materials design and discovery. Due to the severe scarcity and cost of high-quality experimental or synthetic simulated training data, however, data-acquisition costs can be considerable. Relying on reasonably accurate approximate legacy baseline labels with low computational complexity represents one of the most effective strategies to curb data-needs, e.g. through &#916;-, transfer-, or multifidelity learning. A surprisingly effective and data-efficient baseline model is presented in the form of a generic coarse-graining Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz, generalizing the empirical Hammett equation toward arbitrary systems and properties. Numerical evidence for the applicability of HIP includes solvation free energies of molecules, formation energies of quaternary elpasolite crystals, carbon adsorption energies on heterogeneous catalytic surfaces, HOMO-LUMO gaps of metallorganic complexes, activation energies for SN2 reactions, and catalyst-substrate binding energies in cross-coupling reactions. After calibration on the same training sets, HIP yields an effective baseline for improved &#916;-machine learning models with superior data-efficiency when compared to previously introduced specialized domain-specific models.</description>

      <title>How Electrolyte pH Affects the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c14208</link>

                Electrolyte pH is known to affect catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). But a clear understanding of why ORR rates respond more strongly to pH over certain catalysts than others has not been developed. Here, we propose that pH effects on the ORR result from electric field induced changes in the binding energies of intermediates involved in kinetically relevant elementary steps. For strongly binding metals (Pt, Ir, Ru, and Pd), whose rates are limited by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step to form *OOH or remove adsorbed OH (*OH), ORR rates are weakly affected by electrolyte pH. This behavior is observed because the binding energies of the reaction intermediates in these steps are minimally affected by electric field strength. The weak pH dependence is most pronounced for Pt, which shows essentially identical rates in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For weakly binding metals (Au, Ag), whose rates are limited by non-PCET O2 adsorption, ORR rates increase significantly when moving from acidic to alkaline electrolytes. This strong pH dependence results from the stabilization of adsorbed O2 by the increasingly negative electric field present at the catalyst surface under alkaline conditions. We argue that modifying electrolyte pH does not change the rate-determining elementary step for the ORR, but does decrease the apparent activation barrier for O2 adsorption over weakly binding catalysts. These arguments are substantiated by a combination of experimental kinetic studies and atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Surface-Dependent Interfacial Concentration of Oxygen Confined within Pd Interlayers: Molecular Dynamics with a Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c15915</link>
      <description>Feicheng Huan, Feng Shi, Gaoyang Luo, Xiang Pan, Jingnan Zheng, Jianguo Wang, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414542564

                Obtaining a detailed understanding of the interfacial dynamics of oxygen on palladium surfaces is crucial for industrial applications. However, it remains challenging to develop reaction&#8211;transport coupling mechanisms to enhance the activity and stability of Pd-based catalysts in confined environments. Herein, by integrating the established global neural network (G-NN) potential and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the interfacial concentrations of confined O2 molecules within Pd interlayers were investigated systematically under various conditions. The developed reactive NN potential, rigorously validated against DFT benchmarks with an average error of 0.026 eV/atom, demonstrated precise structural discrimination capabilities among three Pd surfaces and subsequently produced reasonable catalytic structures. The Pd(100) surface exhibited the highest reactivity, followed by Pd(211), with the lowest on Pd(111). These differences show strong correlations with a reduced interlayer distance (approximately 1 nm) and the degree of surface reconstruction patterns through a comprehensive analysis of mean square displacement and reaction rate. Density distribution, in conjunction with radial distribution function analyses, further demonstrates how the interlayer confinement effect, as well as surface-specific atomic arrangements, remarkably regulate the interfacial concentration of oxygen. This work provides universal guidance for elucidating the macroscopic mechanism linking the bulk and interfacial concentrations in confined systems through large-scale simulations.</description>
