      <title>Microkinetic Molecular Volcano Plots for Enhanced Catalyst Selectivity and Activity Predictions</title>

                Molecular volcano plots, which facilitate the rapid prediction of the activity and selectivity of prospective catalysts, have emerged as powerful tools for computational catalysis. Here, we integrate microkinetic modeling into the volcano plot framework to develop "microkinetic molecular volcano plots". The resulting unified computational framework allows the influence of important reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, and concentration, to be quickly incorporated and more complex situations, such as off-cycle resting states and coupled catalytic cycles, to be tackled. Compared to previous generations of molecular volcanoes, these microkinetic counterparts offer a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic behavior, in which selectivity and product ratios can be explicitly determined by tracking the evolution of each product concentration over time. This is demonstrated by examining two case studies, rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation and metal-catalyzed hydrosilylation, in which the unique insights provided by microkinetic modeling, as well as the ability to simultaneously screen catalysts and reaction conditions, are highlighted. To facilitate the construction of these plots/maps, we introduce mikimo, a Python program that seamlessly integrates with our previously developed automated volcano builder, volcanic.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electrocatalytic Urea Formation from Gas Pollutants on Heteronuclear Dual-Metal Atom Anchored N-Doped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c01378</link>

                The electrochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions is considered a promising alternative to the harsh industrial Haber-Bosch process. However, the development of highly active and selective electrocatalysts remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a novel mechanism for urea synthesis on dual-atom catalysts (DACs) using two gas pollutants (NO and CO) is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that urea can be synthesized through consecutive C&#8211;N coupling and hydrogenation steps on heteronuclear DACs, in which the stable adsorption of NO and CO on DACs significantly contributes to the excellent performance for urea formation. Notably, only CoZn, CoCu, and FeZn@N6/C can continuously accept proton&#8211;electron and ultimately achieve urea formation, exhibiting low limiting potentials of &#8722;0.27, &#8722;0.30, and &#8722;0.60 V, respectively. Furthermore, it is also determined that an alternative mechanism is preferable on three DACs. Moreover, competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, as well as reductions of CO and NO reductions, can be effectively suppressed, thereby endowing high selectivity for urea generation. Importantly, this study not only advances a novel mechanism for urea production utilizing gas pollutants but also broadens the applicability of DACs in electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-block germanenes as a promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0211907</link>

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a pivotal process in hydrogen fuel cells crucial for enhancing fuel cell performance through suitable catalysts, remains a challenging aspect of development. This study explores the catalytic potential of germanene on Al (111), taking advantage of the successful preparation of stable reconstructed germanene layers on Al (111) and the excellent catalytic performance exhibited by germanium-based nanomaterials. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the O2 molecule can be effectively activated on both freestanding and supported germanene nanosheets, featuring kinetic barriers of 0.40 and 0.04 eV, respectively. The presence of the Al substrate not only significantly enhances the stability of the reconstructed germanene but also preserves its exceptional ORR catalytic performance. These theoretical findings offer crucial insights into the substrate-mediated modulation of germanene stability and catalytic efficiency, paving the way for the design of stable and efficient ORR catalysts for future applications.</description>

      <title>MXenes as Electrocatalysts for Energy Conversion Applications: Advances and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aesr.202400033</link>
      <description>Mohamed El Ouardi, Omar Ait Layachi, Badr&#8208;Eddine Channab, Ayoub El Idrissi, Amal BaQais, Madjid Arab, Mohamed Zbair, Mohamed Saadi, Hassan Ait Ahsaine, Advanced energy and sustainability research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399756246

                Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene&#8208;based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Amorphous Molybdenum Sulfide Thin Film Electrocatalysts: Trade-Off between Specific Activity and Microscopic Porosity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c06308</link>
      <description>Thom R. Harris-Lee, Tom Turvey, Gunani Jayamaha, Myunghee Kang, Frank Marken, Andrew L. Johnson, Jie Zhang, Cameron L. Bentley, ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399758517

                Amorphous molybdenum sulfide (a-MoSx) is a promising candidate to replace noble metals as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in electrochemical water splitting. So far, understanding of the activity of a-MoSx in relation to its physical (e.g., porosity) and chemical (e.g., Mo/S bonding environments) properties has mostly been derived from bulk electrochemical measurements, which provide limited information about electrode materials that possess microscopic structural heterogeneities. To overcome this limitation, herein, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) has been deployed to characterize the microscopic electrochemical activity of a-MoSx thin films (ca. 200 nm thickness), which possess a significant three-dimensional structure (i.e., intrinsic porosity) when produced by electrodeposition. A novel two-step SECCM protocol is designed to quantitatively determine spatially resolved electrochemical activity and electrochemical surface area (ECSA) within a single, high-throughput measurement. It is shown for the first time that although the highest surface area (e.g., most porous) regions of the a-MoSx film possess the highest total activity (measured by the electrochemical current), they do not possess the highest specific activity (measured by the ECSA-normalized current density). Instead, the areas of highest specific activity are localized at/around circular structures, coined "pockmarks", which are tens to hundreds of micrometers in size and ubiquitous to a-MoSx films produced by electrodeposition. By coupling this technique with structural and elemental composition analysis techniques (scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and correlating ECSA with activity and specific activity across SECCM scans, this work furthers the understanding of structure&#8211;activity relations in a-MoSx and highlights the importance of local measurements for the systematic and rational design of thin film catalyst materials.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Exploration of the Origin of Alkaline Dependence in the Oxidation of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural Catalyzed by NiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                Alkaline dependence is a common phenomenon in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass, and investigating the influence of alkalinity on the oxidation mechanisms is crucial for enhancing both the activity and the selectivity of biomass oxidation. Herein, we constructed five NiO2Hx catalysts under different alkaline environments (pH &#8776; 9&#8211;13) and employed density functional theory methods to investigate the reaction mechanisms of the selective oxidation of the biomass platform molecule 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The origin of alkaline dependence in HMF electrochemical oxidation was analyzed, and the results indicate that the catalyst alkalinity determines the oxidation pathway of HMF to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid: under weak alkalinity (pH &#8776; 9&#8211;11), the adsorption and activation of the alcohol group in HMF are more favorable, resulting in preferential oxidation of the alcohol group; under strong alkalinity (pH &#8776; 11&#8211;13), the aldehyde group of HMF is more prone to adsorb and activate on the catalyst surface, resulting in a predominant aldehyde oxidation. With the increase in the alkalinity of NiO2Hx, there is a decrease of H atom coverage and an increase in the valence state of Ni, resulting in a transformation in the preferential oxidation pathway of HMF from the alcohol group to the aldehyde group as well as a transition in the oxidation mechanism from direct oxidation to indirect oxidation. NiOOH under moderately alkaline environment effectively reduces the Gibbs free energy change for C&#8211;H/O&#8211;H bonds cleavage, lowering the reaction energy. It significantly enhances the oxidation ability of alcohol and aldehyde groups, exhibiting the highest catalytic performance in the conversion of HMF to FDCA. The study not only provide a comprehensive explanation for the alkaline dependence of HMF oxidation but also offer guidance on how to rationally design catalysts for improving oxidative performance through alkalinity adjustments.</description>

                Abstract Efficient, stable, and inexpensive electrocatalysts are essential to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during water electrolysis applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXene) show great potential in functional heterogeneous interface engineering for electrocatalytic OER. However, it is still a challenge to regulate the interlayer space and realize the heterogeneous layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer ordered embedding for MXene. Herein, a simple hydrothermal&#8208;assisted strategy is proposed to prepare highly conductive Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene supported by synergized Ni 2+ , Co 2+ , and Fe 3+ with bilayer H 2 O, which significantly enlarges the interlayer distances and improves the interlayer ion concentrations. Benefiting from modulated interface chemistry, embedded metal ions undergo multi&#8208;directional in situ growth on the MXene substrate, thereby forming a stable 0D/2D@2D nano&#8208;hybrid material (NiFe/MX&#8208;HT). Combining density functional theory calculations with experiments demonstrates that MXene offers a framework for electron transfer, enhances the exposure of active sites, modulates the electronic structure, and greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in the process of OER. Thus, NiFe/MX&#8208;HT requires only 230 mV to achieve 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains stability even after operating at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 150 h. This work offers new insights into exploring various functional MXene&#8208;based heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Electrochemical Transformations on a Metal-Oxide Surface during Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>

                Oxygen evolution catalysis fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This tutorial and minireview covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. Here, we highlight the ultrafast trigger and probes of the electron-doped SrTiO3/electrolyte as the primary example in which light probes across the electromagnetic spectrum have detected intermediate forms. We compare the results to other early transition-metal-oxide surfaces when they exist for select probes and longer timescales. The first part covers how the catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the semiconducting depletion and electrolyte Helmholtz layers. The second part covers the detection of the intermediates that occur upon electron and proton transfer from an adsorbed water species by transient spectroscopy. Their detection by a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and a coherent acoustic wave respectively targets electronic states, vibrational levels, and lattice strain respectively. One of the aims is a tutorial on how these measurements are made and to what extent they allow for the interpretation of experimental spectra by intermediate configurations predicted by theory. Another aim is to describe what these experiments directly recommend in terms of future efforts to visualize the OER intermediates and their dynamics.</description>

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technology is seen as the most compatible hydrogen production technology with renewable energy generation. However, the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the scarcity of acid-resistant, high-activity, and low-cost catalysts have seriously hindered the overall efficiency and manufacturing costs of PEMWE. Recently, ruthenium (Ru)-based materials have gradually attracted attention due to their suitable binding strength toward oxygen intermediates and lowest price in the noble metal family. Herein, the great achievements and progress of Ru-based acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively reviewed, which started with a general description of reaction mechanisms and in situ characterization techniques to understand the structure&#8211;activity relationships. Subsequently, some typical strategies to enhance the activity and stability of Ru-based electrocatalysts are highlighted. Insights from synthesis methods, advanced characterizations, intermediate evolution, and theoretical calculations are provided, together with our viewpoints on the daunting challenges and future endeavors of Ru-based OER electrocatalysts for their practical employment.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Surface Oxygen Coverage on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction over a CoFeNiCr High-Entropy Alloy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14121058</link>
      <description>Geng Yuan, Luis Ruiz Pestana, Nanomaterials. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399803259

                Developing cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for advancing sustainable energy applications. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) made from earth-abundant transition metals, thanks to their remarkable stability and electrocatalytic performance, provide a promising alternative to expensive electrocatalysts typically derived from noble metals. While pristine HEA surfaces have been theoretically investigated, and the effect of oxygen coverage on conventional metal electrocatalysts has been examined, the impact of surface oxygen coverage on the electrocatalytic performance of HEAs remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reconstruct the free energy diagram of OER intermediates on CoFeNiCr HEA surfaces with varying oxygen coverages, evaluating their impact on the rate-limiting step and theoretical overpotential. Our findings reveal that increased oxygen coverage weakens the adsorption of HO* and O*, but not HOO*. As a result, the theoretical overpotential for the OER decreases with higher oxygen coverage, and the rate-limiting step shifts from the third oxidation step (HOO* formation) at low coverage to the first oxidation step (HO* formation) at higher coverage.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Electronic Properties and Stability of Rh3 Clusters on Rutile TiO2 for Potential Photocatalytic Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14121051</link>
      <description>Moteb Alotaibi, Nanomaterials. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399806083

                Addressing the pressing needs for alternatives to fossil fuel-based energy sources, this research explores the intricate interplay between Rhodium (Rh3) clusters and titanium dioxide (TiO2) to improve photocatalytic water splitting for the generation of eco-friendly hydrogen. This research applies the density functional theory (DFT) coupled with the Hartree&#8211;Fock theory to meticulously examine the structural and electronic structures of Rh3 clusters on TiO2 (110) interfaces. Considering the photocatalytic capabilities of TiO2 and its inherent limitations in harnessing visible light, the potential for metals such as Rh3 clusters to act as co-catalysts is assessed. The results show that triangular Rh3 clusters demonstrate remarkable stability and efficacy in charge transfer when integrated into rutile TiO2 (110), undergoing oxidation in optimal adsorption conditions and altering the electronic structures of TiO2. The subsequent analysis of TiO2 surfaces exhibiting defects indicates that Rh3 clusters elevate the energy necessary for the formation of an oxygen vacancy, thereby enhancing the stability of the metal oxide. Additionally, the combination of Rh3-cluster adsorption and oxygen-vacancy formation generates polaronic and localized states, crucial for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of metal oxide in the visible light range. Through the DFT analysis, this study elucidates the importance of Rh3 clusters as co-catalysts in TiO2-based photocatalytic frameworks, paving the way for empirical testing and the fabrication of effective photocatalysts for hydrogen production. The elucidated impact on oxygen vacancy formation and electronic structures highlights the complex interplay between Rh3 clusters and TiO2 surfaces, providing insightful guidance for subsequent studies aimed at achieving clean and sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Double&#8208;Hollow Au@CdS Yolk@Shell Nanostructures as Superior Plasmonic Photocatalysts for Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202402392</link>

Chen, Yuhi Nakayasu, Yongcheng Lin, Jui&#8208;Cheng Kao, Kai&#8208;Chi Hsiao, Quang Tuyen Le, Keh&#8208;Minn Chang, Ming&#8208;Chung Wu, Jyh&#8208;Pin Chou, Chun&#8208;Wei Pao, Tso&#8208;Fu Mark Chang, Masato Sone, Chun&#8208;Yi Chen, Yu&#8208;Chieh Lo, Yan&#8208;Gu Lin, Akira Yamakata, Yung&#8208;Jung Hsu, Advanced functional materials.

                Abstract Structural engineering has proven effective in tailoring the photocatalytic properties of semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, a sophisticated double&#8208;hollow yolk@shell nanostructure composed of a plasmonic, mobile, hollow Au nanosphere (HGN) yolk and a permeable, hollow CdS shell is proposed to achieve remarkable solar hydrogen production. The shell thickness of HGN@CdS is finely adjusted from 7.7, 18.4 to 24.5 nm to investigate its influence on the photocatalytic performance. Compared with pure HGN, pure CdS, a physical mixture of HGN and CdS, and a counterpart single&#8208;hollow cit&#8208;Au@CdS yolk@shell nanostructure, HGN@CdS exhibits superior hydrogen production under visible light illumination (&#955; = 400&#8211;700 nm). The apparent quantum yield of hydrogen production reaches 8.2% at 320 nm, 6.2% at 420 nm, and 4.4% at 660 nm. The plasmon&#8208;enhanced activity at 660 nm is exceptional, surpassing the plasmon&#8208;induced photoactivities of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plasmonic photocatalysts ever reported. The superiority of HGN@CdS originates from the creation of charge separation state at HGN/CdS heterojunction, the considerably long&#8208;lived hot electrons of plasmonic HGN, the magnified electric field, and the advantageous features of double&#8208;hollow yolk@shell nanostructures. The findings can provide a guideline for the rational design of versatile double&#8208;hollow yolk@shell nanostructures for widespread photocatalytic applications.</description>

                The present study investigates the catalytic performance of a hg-C3N4 quantum dot aimed at enhancing electrochemical water splitting using first-principles density functional theory. The size of the considered quantum dot lies within the range reported experimentally (2&#8211;4 nm) [Zhou et al. ACS Nano 2015, 9, 12480]. The nitrogen vacancies are created in the considered hg-C3N4 structure to simulate the realistic scenario as the presence of nitrogen and carbon defects is reported in the synthesized hg-C3N4 quantum dots. First, the structural and vibrational properties are computed to ensure the stability of the nitrogen-deficient hg-C3N4 quantum dots, and subsequently, their electronic and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties are investigated. The calculated HER parameters, i.e., adsorption energies, Gibbs free energies, and overpotentials, demonstrate that the considered hg-C3N4 quantum dot with nitrogen vacancies can be used as a moderately effective electrocatalyst for HER performance. We also considered the quantum dot to be dissolved in water and ethanol and find that the overpotential gets drastically reduced to 16 mV for the alcohol-dissolved quantum dot, while some significant reduction is seen for the aqueous solution also. As a result, this study suggests that the nitrogen-deficient hg-C3N4 quantum dots dissolved in ethanol are excellent candidates for catalysis aimed at sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting.</description>

      <title>Engineering Durable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers through Suppressed Electrochemical Corrosion of a NiFe&#8211;Graphitic Carbon Shell Anode Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02696</link>

                Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows potential for hydrogen production using cost-effective nonplatinum group metal (non-PGM) catalysts, achieving high current density performance. However, challenges remain in developing materials, including stable membranes and ionomers under alkaline conditions and non-PGM catalysts that are both high-performing and durable for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This study presents an approach for synthesizing highly crystalline carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticle networks using a polyphenolic tannic acid precursor and non-PGM NiFe metal cores, creating a durable OER catalyst. The simplified synthetic process introduces graphitic carbon layers (GCLs) to encompass the NiFe catalytic nanoparticles. Rigorous testing over 1100 h of continuous current operation demonstrates the stability of the catalysts, which is attributed to the robust interaction between the catalyst and the carbon support. The enhanced durability is further confirmed through theoretical calculations, showing greater resistance to corrosion in graphitic carbon compared to defective carbon. This study highlights the importance of highly crystalline carbon structures for achieving both high performance and durability in OER catalysts, which are vital for cost-effective AEMWE technologies. The findings contribute significantly to understanding the role of regulating carbon crystalline properties in developing efficient and durable non-PGM OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Searching Materials Space for Hydride Superconductors at Ambient Pressure</title>

                Abstract A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted approach is employed to search for superconducting hydrides under ambient pressure within an extensive dataset comprising over 150 000 compounds. The investigation yields &#8776;50 systems with transition temperatures surpassing 20 K, and some even reaching above 70 K. These compounds have very different crystal structures, with different dimensionality, chemical composition, stoichiometry, and arrangement of the hydrogens. Interestingly, most of these systems display slight thermodynamic instability, implying that their synthesis will re quire conditions beyond ambient equilibrium. Moreover, a consistent chemical composition is found in the majority of these systems, which combines alkali or alkali&#8208;earth elements with noble metals. This observation suggests a promising avenue for future experimental investigations into high&#8208;temperature superconductivity within hydrides at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Microenvironment regulation breaks the Faradaic efficiency-current density trade-off for electrocatalytic deuteration using D2O</title>

                Abstract The high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the electrocatalytic deuteration of organics with D 2 O at a large current density is significant for deuterated electrosynthesis. However, the FE and current density are the two ends of a seesaw because of the severe D 2 evolution side reaction at nearly industrial current densities. Herein, we report a combined scenario of a nanotip-enhanced electric field and surfactant-modified interface microenvironment to enable the electrocatalytic deuteration of arylacetonitrile in D 2 O with an 80% FE at &#8722;100 mA cm &#8722;2 . The increased concentration with low activation energy of arylacetonitrile due to the large electric field along the tips and the accelerated arylacetonitrile transfer and suppressed D 2 evolution by the surfactant-created deuterophobic microenvironment contribute to breaking the trade-off between a high FE and large current density. Furthermore, the application of our strategy in other deuteration reactions with improved Faradaic efficiencies at &#8722;100 mA cm &#8722;2 rationalizes the design concept.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;Ab Initio&lt;/i&gt; Studies of Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction for Small Cu Cluster Supported on Polar Substrates</title>

                Small Cu clusters are excellent candidates for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR), and their catalytic performance is expected to be significantly influenced by the interaction between the substrate and cluster. In this study, we systematically investigate the CO2RR for a Cu3 cluster anchored on Janus MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates using density functional theory calculations. These substrates feature a broken vertical mirror symmetry, which generates spontaneous out-of-plane polarization and offers two distinct polar surfaces to support the Cu3 cluster. Our findings reveal that the CO2RR performance on the Cu3 cluster is strongly influenced by the polarization direction and strength of the MoSX (X = Se, Te) substrates. Notably, the Cu3 cluster supported on the S-terminated MoSTe surface (Cu3(S)@MoSTe) demonstrates the highest CO2RR activity, producing methane. These results underscore the pivotal role of substrate polarization in modulating the binding strength of reactants and reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the CO2RR efficiency.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction is the bottleneck to energy-efficient water-based electrolysis for the production of hydrogen and other solar fuels. In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), precious metals have generally been necessary for the stable catalysis of this reaction. In this work, we report that delamination of cobalt tungstate enables high activity and durability through the stabilization of oxide and water-hydroxide networks of the lattice defects in acid. The resulting catalysts achieve lower overpotentials, a current density of 1.8 amperes per square centimeter at 2 volts, and stable operation up to 1 ampere per square centimeter in a PEMWE system at industrial conditions (80&#176;C) at 1.77 volts; a threefold improvement in activity; and stable operation at 1 ampere per square centimeter over the course of 600 hours.</description>

      <title>Alkali-assisted polymeric carbon nitride effectively improves the visible-light-driven intrinsic reactivity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution: A first-principles analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0214552</link>

                Two-dimensional (2D) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) materials have drawn broad attention as promising candidates for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, it remains a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the visible light absorption, separation of photogenerated carriers, and activity. Herein, alkali metals doping PCN (e.g., C6N6 and C2N) are systematically investigated based on density functional theory. Different from the conventional notion of doping atoms as active sites, the actual active site is the intrinsic pyridine nitrogen surrounding the alkali metal. Compared to the change of Gibbs free energy value of &#8722;0.45 eV (&#8722;0.60 eV) for pristine C6N6 (C2N), Li or Cs doped PCN decreases to &#8722;0.03 eV (&#8722;0.10 eV) or 0.06 eV (&#8722;0.11 eV), respectively, benefitting from the adjustment of the 3p electronic state occupation for N atoms by charges transfer from alkali metal. Meanwhile, Li or Cs doping not only broadens the absorption of visible light by narrowing the band edge position but also promotes the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by regulating their spatial separation, which is further confirmed by significant photocurrents for Li or Cs doped PCN based on nonequilibrium Green's function simulation. Our work could provide interesting insights into the mechanistic understanding and the highly efficient design of PCN materials in photocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Non-precious electrocatalysts as the alternative to Pt have become a hot research area in the last decade due to the suitable catalytic activity in Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in electrochemical systems. In this work, the density functional theory calculations were investigated to explore the activity of Fe, Cu, and Fe-Cu atoms supported by N-doped graphene as the ORR electrocatalyst for Oxygen-depolarized cathodes (ODCs). To this end, the ORR mechanism was surveyed in detail in the gas and solvent phases. The results show that the solvent phase leads to a higher overpotential and thermodynamic limiting potential. According to the density of states curves, there are strong interactions between metal atom and substrate that can effectively tune the electronics of catalysts. Bader's analysis confirms that, in addition to the single metal atoms, nitrogen atoms have also played a critical role in charge transfer between substrates and oxygen molecules in ORR. It is also predicted that Fe-Cu@NC SAC exhibits the highest catalytic activity which is consistent with thermodynamic limiting potential and theoretical overpotential of &#8722; 0.26 and 0.66 (V vs. SHE), respectively, indicating that this type of catalyst may be a suitable candidate instead of precious metals in oxygen-depolarized cathodes in electrochemical devices.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen (H2) is considered the most promising clean energy source to replace conventional fossil fuels. Despite the exceptional catalytic activity of Pt-group metals, the high cost and relatively low durability of these noble metal-based catalysts remain key bottlenecks for sustainable hydrogen production at the industrial scale. In this report, we synthesized a new type of MXene, tungsten titanium carbide (W2TiC2). By loading cobalt (Co) onto the surface of W2TiC2, we developed a highly effective and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized catalyst exhibited a small overpotential of 62.58 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel slope of 44.34 mV/dec. At high current density of 100 mA/cm2 and 1000 mA/cm2, the low overpotentials of 191.18 mV and 407.72 mV were achieved, significantly outperforming the commercial Pt/C electrode. Under both current ranges, our catalyst exhibited excellent stability of 500 h at 10 mA/cm2 and for 100 h at 1000 mA/cm2 without any obvious degradation. In flow cell tests, by pairing with Ni foam, our catalyst also required much lower cell voltage than commercial Ni foam||Pt/C and maintained ~ 100% H2 faradaic efficiency over the 15h continuous tests from 100 to 400 mA/cm2. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) demonstrated a temperature induced redistribution of Co on MXenes from single sites and large nanoparticles (NPs) to uniform small NPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), revealed that the HER activity was sensitive to the coordination environment of Co on W2TiC2, and the Co-W interface is the likely HER active site . This work sheds light on structure design and utilization of metal-support interaction (MSI) in MXene-supported metal catalysts for the efficient electrochemical water splitting at industrial scale.</description>

      <title>Structural regulation strategies and advances of antiperovskites in electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0130835</link>
      <description>Jiahui Guo, Huan Liu, Chunping Li, Jie Bai, Chemical physics reviews. 5(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399888725

                Forced by the problems of severe energy crisis, it is urgent to explore high efficiency sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies, particularly for electrolytic water devices and rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The efficiency of these two devices is mainly dominated by the half-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The design of efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is the key for the development of water splitting and rechargeable ZABs. The antiperovskites as a promising family of electrocatalyst with structure flexibility, high electrical conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic properties. Defining the enhancement mechanism toward HER, OER, and ORR is an urgent problem for the application of antiperovskite in the electrocatalysis field. This review brief introduces the fundamentals of HER/OER/ORR and summarizes the recent progress of antiperovskite materials in electrocatalysis field, including the research on structural regulation strategies of catalytic properties and catalytic mechanism. Based on ex situ/in situ characterized of electrocatalytic mechanism, the future challenges of antiperovskite in electrocatalytic mechanism and intrinsic modulation were prospected. The basic frontier issues are aimed in the field of HER/OER/ORR to provide theoretical guidance for the development of efficient and economical multifunctional electrocatalysts for ZAB and water splitting.</description>

                Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) supported single transition metal (TM) atom (TM1/POM) as an efficient soluble redox mediator for Li&#8211;O2 batteries is comprehensively investigated by first-principles calculations. Among the pristine POM and four kinds of TM1/POM (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Pt), Co1/POM not only maintains good structural and thermodynamic stability in oxidized and reduced states but also exhibits promising electro(chemical) catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li&#8211;O2 batteries with the lowest Gibbs free energy barriers. Further investigations demonstrate that the moderate binding strength of Li2-xO2 (x = 0, 1, and 2) intermediates on Co1/POM guarantees favorable Li2O2 formation and decomposition. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the introduced Co single atom as an electron transfer bridge can not only efficiently improve the electronic conductivity of POM but also regulate the bonding/antibonding states around the Fermi level of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox. The solvent effect on the OER catalytic performance and the electronic properties of [Co1/POM-Li2O2]ox with and without dimethyl sulfoxide solvent are also investigated.</description>

                Electrochemical H2 generation and CO2 reduction address the energy and environmental crisis plaguing the world. An efficient electrocatalyst would require the lowest overpotential for these reactions. Given its position on the volcano plot near platinum, palladium presents itself as a viable alternative for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the activity is limited by a high overpotential. It is also a good electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to the favorable position of the d-band center. Nevertheless, the CO poisoning of the active site results in low electrocatalytic stability. Herein, we report a Ni-incorporated palladium catalyst, NiPd, which reduces water to H2 at a very low overpotential of 25 mV (&#951;10). Furthermore, it reduces CO2 to formate with a very high faradaic efficiency of 97% at a potential of &#8722;0.25 V (vs RHE). DFT studies show that Ni inclusion leads to the facile activation of CO2 due to a bent adsorption configuration at the catalyst surface. The NiPd catalyst exhibits a strong and stable performance for HER (400 h) as well as for CO2RR (9 h) with high structural integrity as proven by postreaction characterization studies.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e &#8722; &#8208;ORR) features energy&#8208;saving and eco&#8208;friendly characteristics, making it a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. However, the common existence of numerous 2e &#8722; &#8208;ORR&#8208;inactive sites/species on electrocatalysts tends to catalyze side reactions, especially under low potentials, which compromises energy efficiency and limits H 2 O 2 yield. Addressing this, a high surface density of mono&#8208;species pyrrolic nitrogen configurations is formed over a polypyrrole@carbon nanotube composite. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculation and experimental investigation collaboratively confirm that these densely distributed and highly selective active sites effectively promote high&#8208;rate 2e &#8722; &#8208;ORR electrocatalysis and inhibit side reactions over a wide potential range. Consequently, an ultra&#8208;high and stable H 2 O 2 yield of up to 67.9/51.2 mol g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 has been achieved on this material at a current density of 200/120 mA cm &#8722;1 , corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 72.8/91.5%. A maximum H 2 O 2 concentration of 13.47 g L &#8722;1 can be accumulated at a current density of 80 mA cm &#8722;1 with satisfactory stability. The strategy of surface active site densification thus provides a promising and universal avenue toward designing highly active and efficient electrocatalysts for 2e &#8722; &#8208;ORR as well as a series of other similar electrochemical processes.</description>

                We explore the phonon transport properties of defect-laden bilayer PtSTe using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural-network force field. Defects prove very efficient at depressing the thermal conductivity of the structure, and flower defects have a particularly powerful effect, comparable to that of double vacancies. Furthermore, the conductivity of the structure with flower defects exhibits an unusual temperature dependence due to structural instability at high temperatures. We look into the distortion to normal modes around the defect by means of the projected phonon density of states and find diverse phenomena including localized modes and blue shifts.</description>

                Abstract Renewable energy&#8208;driven proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) attracts widespread attention as a zero&#8208;emission and sustainable technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with sluggish OER kinetics and rapid deactivation are major obstacles to the widespread commercialization of PEMWE. To date, although various advanced electrocatalysts have been reported to enhance acidic OER performance, Ru/Ir&#8208;based nanomaterials remain the most promising catalysts for PEMWE applications. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective Ru/Ir catalysts. Since the structure&#8208;performance relationship is one of the most important tools for studying the reaction mechanism and constructing the optimal catalytic system. In this review, the recent research progress from the construction of unsaturated sites to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and deactivation mechanism of catalysts is summarized. First, a general understanding of OER reaction mechanism, catalyst dissolution mechanism, and active site structure is provided. Then, advances in the design and synthesis of advanced acidic OER catalysts are reviewed in terms of the classification of unsaturated active site design, i.e., alloy, core&#8208;shell, single&#8208;atom, and framework structures. Finally, challenges and perspectives are presented for the future development of OER catalysts and renewable energy technologies for hydrogen production.</description>

                The development of transition metal-based catalytic platforms that promote bioorthogonal reactions inside living cells remains a major challenge in chemical biology. This is particularly true for palladium-based catalysts, which are very powerful in organic synthesis but perform poorly in the cellular environment, mainly due to their rapid deactivation. We now demonstrate that grafting Pd(II) complexes into engineered &#946;-sheets of a model WW domain results in cell-compatible palladominiproteins that effectively catalyze depropargylation reactions inside HeLa cells. The concave shape of the WW domain &#946;-sheet proved particularly suitable for accommodating the metal center and protecting it from rapid deactivation in the cellular environment. A thorough NMR and computational study confirmed the formation of the metal-stapled peptides and allowed us to propose a three-dimensional structure for this novel metalloprotein motif.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Regions of Reliability based on Sampling Distance Evaluation with Feature Decorrelation for Tabular Time Datasets</title>

                Abstract Despite successful use in a wide variety of disciplines for data analysis and prediction, machine learning (ML) methods suffer from a lack of understanding of the reliability of predictions due to the lack of transparency and black-box nature of ML models. In materials science and other fields, typical ML model results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method for uncertainty quantification (UQ) of ML predictions has not been available. Focusing on the intuitive and computationally efficient similarity-based UQ, we show that a simple metric based on Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density together with the decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization allows effective separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to light GBM machine learning using a set of time series tabular data sets. We also show that this metric is a more effective UQ tool than the standard approach of using the average distance of k nearest neighbors (k = 1&#8211;10) in features space for similarity evaluation. The computational simplicity of this dataset combined with its applicability to time series datasets allows it to be readily used in numerous real world problems.</description>
