      <title>Low&#8208;Cost Self&#8208;Reconstructed High Entropy Oxide as an Ultra&#8208;Durable OER Electrocatalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>

                Abstract Future energy loss can be minimized to a greater extent via developing highly active electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolyzers. Incorporating an innovative design like high entropy oxides, dealloying, structural reconstruction, in situ activation can potentially reduce the energy barriers between practical and theoretical potentials. Here, a Fd&#8208;3m spinel group high entropy oxide is developed via a simple solvothermal and calcination approach. The developed (FeCoMnZnMg) 3 O 4 electrocatalyst shows a near equimolar distribution of all the metal elements resulting in higher entropy (&#916;S &#8776;1.61R) and higher surface area. The self&#8208;reconstructed spinel high entropy oxide (S&#8208;HEO) catalyst exhibited a lower overpotential of 240 mV to reach 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and enhanced reaction kinetics (59 mV dec &#8722;1 ). Noticeably, the S&#8208;HEO displayed an outstanding durability of 1000 h without any potential loss, significantly outperforming most of the reported OER electrocatalysts. Further, S&#8208;HEO is evaluated as the anode catalyst for an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) in 1 m , 0.1 m KOH, and DI water at 20 and 60 &#176;C. These results demonstrate that S&#8208;HEO is a highly attractive, non&#8208;noble class of materials for high active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts allowing fine&#8208;tuning beyond the limits of bi&#8208; or trimetallic oxides.</description>

      <description>Jianpeng Guo, Yousof Haghshenas, Yiran Jiao, Priyank V. Kumar, Boris I. Yakobson, Ajit K. Roy, Yan Jiao, Klaus Regenauer&#8208;Lieb, David Nguyen, Zhenhai Xia, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401191227

                Abstract Catalysis is crucial for clean energy, green chemistry, and environmental remediation, but traditional methods rely on expensive and scarce precious metals. This review addresses this challenge by highlighting the promise of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and the recent advancements in their rational design. Innovative strategies such as physics&#8208;inspired descriptors, high&#8208;throughput computational techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted design with machine learning (ML) are explored, moving beyond time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. Additionally, biomimicry, inspired by efficient enzymes in nature, offers valuable insights. This review systematically analyses these design strategies, providing a roadmap for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts from abundant elements. Clean energy applications (water splitting, fuel cells, batteries) and green chemistry (ammonia synthesis, CO 2 reduction) are targeted while delving into the fundamental principles, biomimetic approaches, and current challenges in this field. The way to a more sustainable future is paved by overcoming catalyst scarcity through rational design.</description>

                Abstract This study unveils a novel concept of symmetric protonic ceramic fuel cells (symm&#8208;PCFCs) with the introduction of a self&#8208;recoverable electrode design, employing the innovative material BaCo 0.4 Fe 0.4 Zr 0.1 Y 0.1 O 3&#8208;&#948; (BCFZY). This research marks a significant milestone as it demonstrates the bi&#8208;functional electrocatalytic activity of BCFZY for the first time. Utilizing density functional theory simulations, the molecular orbital interactions and defect chemistry of BCFZY are explored, uncovering its unique capability for the reversible exsolution and dissolution of Co&#8208;Fe nanoparticles under redox conditions. This feature is pivotal in promoting both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. Leveraging this insight, a cell is fabricated exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity and fuel flexibility as evidenced by the peak power densities of &#8776;350, 287, and 221 mW cm &#8722;2 (at 600 &#176;C) with hydrogen, methanol, and methane as fuels, respectively. Experiments also show that the reversible exsolution/dissolution mitigates performance degradation, enabling prolonged operational life through self&#8208;recovery. This approach paves the way for novel, advanced, durable, and commercially viable symm&#8208;PCFCs.</description>

      <title>Systematic assessment of various universal machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/mgea.58</link>
      <description>Haochen Yu, Matteo Giantomassi, Giuliana Materzanini, Junjie Wang, Gian&#8208;Marco Rignanese, Materials Genome Engineering Advances. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401233871

                Abstract Machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to perform simulations of ab initio quality over very large time and length scales. More recently, various universal machine&#8208;learning models have been proposed as an out&#8208;of&#8208;box approach avoiding the need to train and validate specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we review and evaluate four different universal machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory implementations and from the Materials Project. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems, offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine&#8208;learning methodologies in materials science.</description>

                Abstract Aiming to efficiently expedite alkaline overall water splitting (OWS) by addressing challenges such as sluggish kinetics and limited stability, a hollow Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH) 2 &#8208;NiS@Ni(OH) 2 nanorod array with surface nanosheets is devised, featuring a high&#8208;index Fe&#8208;doped Ni(OH) 2 (101)&#8208;NiS(211) heterostructural interface and an upshifted d &#8208;band center. This nanoarchitecture intensifies the adsorption and interaction of H 2 O and OH &#8722; reactants on the electrocatalyst surface, suitably bonds the * H intermediate in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and accelerates electron movement of * H, minimizes the energy requirement of the rate&#8208;limiting phase ( * OH &#8594; * O) in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by facilitating O&#9472;H cleavage of * OH and optimally adsorbs * O, amplifies the exposure of surface&#8208;active centers, and ultimately reduces the apparent activation energy. Consequently, the overpotentials are as low as 66.4 mV (HER) and 254.9 mV (OER) at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , alongside high turnover frequencies of 142 s &#8722;1 (H 2 ) and 279 s &#8722;1 (O 2 ) at 100 and 300 mV, respectively, markedly outperforming direct&#8208;electrodeposited analogues. When functioning as a bifunctional electrode in OWS, this material merely requires 1.57 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and sustains an operation for 168 h, approaching Pt/C||RuO 2 benchmark.</description>

                The sluggish kinetics of Volmer step in the alkaline hydrogen evolution results in large energy consumption. The challenge that has yet well resolved is to control the water adsorption and dissociation. Here, we develop biaxially strained MoSe2 three dimensional nanoshells that exhibit enhanced catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 58.2 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in base, and long-term stable activity in membrane-electrode-assembly based electrolyser at 1 A cm&#8722;2. Compared to the flat and uniaxial-strained MoSe2, we establish that the stably adsorbed OH engineer on biaxially strained MoSe2 changes the water adsorption configuration from O-down on Mo to O-horizontal on OH* via stronger hydrogen bonds. The favorable water dissociation on 3-coordinated Mo sites and hydrogen adsorption on 4-coordinated Mo sites constitute a tandem electrolysis, resulting in thermodynamically favorable hydrogen evolution. This work deepens our understanding to the impact of strain dimensions on water dissociation and inspires the design of nanostructured catalysts for accelerating the rate-determining step in multi-electron reactions. Hydroxide is the most abundant anion in alkaline solutions, but its impact on alkaline water electrolysis remains unclear. Herein, the authors report a biaxial strain induced OH engineer on MoSe2 to accelerate alkaline hydrogen evolution by modifying the water dissociation.</description>

                A heteronuclear dual transition metal atom catalyst is a promising strategy to solve and relieve the increasing energy and environment crisis. However, the role of each atom still does not efficiently differentiate due to the high activity but low detectability of each transition metal in the synergistic catalytic process when considering the influence of heteronuclear induced atomic difference for each transition metal atom, thus seriously hindering intrinsic mechanism finding. Herein, we proposed coordinate environment vary induced heterogenization of homonuclear dual&#8208;transition metal, which inherits the advantage of heteronuclear transition metal atom catalyst but also controls the variable of the two atoms to explore the underlying mechanism. Based on this proposal, employing density functional theory study and machine learning, 23 kinds of homonuclear transition metals are doping in four asymmetric C 3 N for heterogenization to evaluate the underlying catalytic mechanism. Our results demonstrate that five catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28 to &#8722;0.48 V. In the meantime, a new mechanism, &#8220;capture&#8211;charge distribution&#8211;recapture&#8211;charge redistribution&#8221;, is developed for both side&#8208;on and end&#8208;on configuration. More importantly, the pronate site of the first hydrogenation is identified based on this mechanism. Our work not only initially makes a deep understanding of the transition dual metal&#8208;based heteronuclear catalyst indirectly but also broadens the development of complicated homonuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts in the future.</description>

                Abstract Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) combine the predictive power of Density Functional Theory (DFT) with the speed and scaling of interatomic potentials, enabling theoretical spectroscopy to be applied to larger and more complex systems than is possible with DFT. In this work, we train an MLIP for quaternary Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) alloy systems of the form Mo 1&#8722; x W x S 2&#8722;2 y Se 2 y , using the equivariant Neural Network (NN) MACE. We demonstrate the ability of this potential to calculate vibrational properties of alloy TMDs including phonon spectra for pure monolayers, and Vibrational Density of States (VDOS) and first-order Raman spectra for alloys across the range of x and y . We show that we retain DFT level accuracy while greatly extending feasible system size and extent of sampling over alloy configurations. We are able to characterize the first-order Raman active modes across the whole range of concentration, particularly for the &#8220;disorder-induced&#8221; modes.</description>

      <title>Ba promoter effect on cobalt-catalyzed ammonia decomposition kinetics: A theoretical analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2024.07.050</link>
      <description>Zahra Almisbaa, Philippe Sautet, Journal of Energy Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401306038

                Ammonia decomposition is a key reaction in the context of hydrogen storage, transport, and release. This study combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with microkinetic modeling to address the promotion mechanism of Ba species for ammonia decomposition on Co catalysts. The modified adsorption properties of Co upon the addition of metallic Ba or BaO suggest that the promoters play a role in alleviating the competitive adsorption of H. Calculating the full reaction pathway of ammonia decomposition shows that limiting the investigation to the N&#8211;N association step, as done previously, overlooks the effect of the promoter on the energy barriers of the NHx dehydrogenation steps. Challenges of modeling the ammonia decomposition reaction are addressed by understanding that the NH2 intermediate is stabilized on the step sites rather than the terrace sites. When the effect of H-coverage on the adsorption of NH3 is not considered in the microkinetic simulations, the results conflict with the experiments. However, accounting for the effect of H-coverage, as performed here, shows that BaO-doped Co has higher rates than pristine Co and Ba-doped Co at the reaction temperature of 723.15 K. When H is adsorbed on the Ba-doped Co, the adsorption of ammonia becomes significantly endergonic, which makes the rates relatively slow. The superiority of the BaO-promoted catalyst is attributed to a lower energy for the transition state of the rate-determining step, coupled with a reduced impact of the hydrogen coverage on weakening the ammonia adsorption. The kinetic analysis of the influence of Ba and BaO on the Co surface shows that BaO-doped Co aligns more closely with experimental observations than Ba-doped Co. This implies that Ba on the Co surface is likely to be in an oxide form under reaction conditions. Understanding the kinetics of the ammonia decomposition reaction provides a foundation for developing highly effective catalysts to accelerate the industrial utilization of ammonia as a sustainable hydrogen carrier.</description>

                Abstract We report high throughput computational screening for magnetic ground state order in 2D materials. The workflow is based on spin spiral calculations and yields the magnetic order in terms of a two-dimensional ordering vector Q . We then include spin-orbit coupling to extract the easy and hard axes for collinear structures and the orientation of spiral planes in non-collinear structures. Finally, for all predicted ferromagnets we compute the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and determine whether or not these are strong enough to overcome the magnetic anisotropy and stabilise a chiral spin spiral ground state. We find 58 ferromagnets, 21 collinear anti-ferromagnets, and 85 non-collinear ground states of which 15 are chiral spin spirals driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The results show that non-collinear order is in fact as common as collinear order in these materials and emphasise the need for detailed investigation of the magnetic ground state when reporting magnetic properties of new materials.</description>

                Abstract Nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts have the potential to combine the respective advantages of both nano&#8208;catalysts and single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts and thus exhibit enhanced performance. Generally, the separation of active sites in space limits the interaction between single atoms and nanoparticles. Heterointerface engineering has the potential to break this limitation. Regretfully, studies on the interface effect between single atoms and nanoparticles are rarely reported. Herein, an unprecedented nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom heterointerface composed of Fe single&#8208;atoms and carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated FeP nanoparticles (Fe SAC/FeP@C) is demonstrated as an efficient electrocatalyst for the nitrate reduction process from alkaline to acidic. Compared with typical nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts (Fe SAC/FePO 4 ) and single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts (Fe SAC), the constructed Fe SAC/FeP@C heterostructure exhibits dramatically enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia performance. Especially in acidic media, the maxmium Faradaic efficiency of ammonia (NH 3 ) can reach 95.6 &#177; 0.5%, with a maximum NH 3 yield of 36.2 &#177; 3.1 mg h &#8722;1 mg cat &#8722;1 (pH = 1.2), which is considerably higher than previously reported. Density functional theory calculations and in situ spectroscopic investigations indicate that the unique charge redistribution at the interface, together with the optimized electronic structure of Fe single&#8208;atoms, strengthens intermediate adsorption and catalytic activity. This work provides a feasible strategy for designing nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts with unique heterointerfaces, as well as valuable insights into nitrate conversion under environmentally relevant wastewater conditions.</description>

      <title>Platinum&#8208;Ruthenium Bimetallic Nanoparticle Catalysts Synthesized Via Direct Joule Heating for Methanol Fuel Cells</title>

                Abstract Platinum&#8208;Ruthenium (PtRu) bimetallic nanoparticles are promising catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) required by direct methanol fuel cells. However, existing catalyst synthesis methods have difficulty controlling their composition and structures. Here, a direct Joule heating method to yield highly active and stable PtRu catalysts for MOR is shown. The optimized Joule heating condition at 1000 &#176;C over 50 microseconds produces uniform PtRu nanoparticles (6.32 wt.% Pt and 2.97 wt% Ru) with an average size of 2.0 &#177; 0.5 nanometers supported on carbon black substrates. They have a large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 239 m 2 g &#8722;1 and a high ECSA normalized specific activity of 0.295 mA cm &#8722;2 . They demonstrate a peak mass activity of 705.9 mA mg Pt &#8722;1 for MOR, 2.8 times that of commercial 20 wt.% platinum/carbon catalysts, and much superior to PtRu catalysts obtained by standard hydrothermal synthesis. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the superior catalytic activity can be attributed to modified Pt sites in PtRu nanoparticles, enabling strong methanol adsorption and weak carbon monoxide binding. Further, the PtRu catalyst demonstrates excellent stability in two&#8208;electrode methanol fuel cell tests with 85.3% current density retention and minimum Pt surface oxidation after 24 h.</description>

                Abstract Ammonia, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density carrier for hydrogen storage, is in great demand worldwide. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) provides a green NH 3 production process. However, the complex reaction pathways for NO 3 RR to NH 3 and the difficulty in controlling intermediate products limit the reduction process. Herein, by incorporating atomic&#8208;level bismuth (Bi) into CuCo 2 O 4 hollow carbon nanofibers, the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst for NO 3 RR is enhanced. The maximum Faradaic efficiency of Bi 1 &#8208;CuCo 2 O 4 is 95.53%, with an NH 3 yield of 448.74 &#181;mol h &#8722;1 cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8 V versus RHE. Density Functional Theory calculations show that the presence of Bi lowers the reaction barrier for the hydrogenation step from *NO 2 to *NO 2 H, while promoting mass transfer on the release of *NH 3 and the reactivation of surface&#8208;active sites. Differential charge density calculations also show that after Bi doping, the charge supplied by the catalyst to NO 3 &#8722; increases from 0.62 to 0.72 e &#8208; , thus reasoned for enhanced NO 3 RR activity. The established nitrate&#8208;Zn battery shows an energy density of 2.81 mW cm &#8722;2 , thus implying the potential application.</description>
