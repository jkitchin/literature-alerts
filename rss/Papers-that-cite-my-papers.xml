      <title>Machine learning potential model for accelerating quantum chemistry&#8208;driven property prediction and molecular design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.18741</link>
      <description>Guoxin Wu, Yujing Zhao, Lei Zhang, Jian Du, Qingwei Meng, Qilei Liu, AIChE Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406884476

                Abstract Quantum chemistry (QC) calculations have significantly advanced the development of materials, drugs, and other molecular products. Molecular geometry optimization is an indispensable step for QC calculations. However, its computational cost increases dramatically with increasing molecular system complexity, hindering the large&#8208;scale molecule screening. This work proposes a deep learning&#8208;based molecular potential energy surface prediction tool (DeePEST) to significantly accelerate geometry optimizations. The key of DeePEST involves the development of a novel machine learning potential model for accurate and fast predictions of molecular energy and atomic forces. These predictions enable efficient molecular geometry optimizations for subsequent predictions of QC properties (single&#8208;point energy, dipole moment, HOMO/LUMO, and 13 C chemical shifts) and COSMO&#8208;SAC&#8208;based thermodynamic properties (activity coefficient). Moreover, DeePEST facilitates efficient computer&#8208;aided molecular designs that involve QC&#8208;based geometry optimizations. The utilization of DeePEST in geometry optimizations achieves high prediction accuracy approaching to rigorous QC methods while maintaining the computational efficiency of molecular mechanics methods.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalysis: From Planar Surfaces to Nanostructured Interfaces</title>

                The reactions critical for the energy transition center on the chemistry of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and the heterogeneous catalyst surfaces that make up electrochemical energy conversion systems. Together, the surface-adsorbate interactions constitute the electrochemical interphase and define reaction kinetics of many clean energy technologies. Practical devices introduce high levels of complexity where surface roughness, structure, composition, and morphology combine with electrolyte, pH, diffusion, and system level limitations to challenge our ability to deconvolute underlying phenomena. To make significant strides in materials design, a structured approach based on well-defined surfaces is necessary to selectively control distinct parameters, while complexity is added sequentially through careful application of nanostructured surfaces. In this review, we cover advances made through this approach for key elements in the field, beginning with the simplest hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions and concluding with more complex organic molecules. In each case, we offer a unique perspective on the contribution of well-defined systems to our understanding of electrochemical energy conversion technologies and how wider deployment can aid intelligent materials design.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and vibrational energy relaxation of the electronically excited PtPOP complex in solution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0241573</link>
      <description>Benedikt O. Birgisson, Asmus Ougaard Dohn, Hannes J&#243;nsson, Gianluca Levi, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406916558

                Understanding the ultrafast vibrational relaxation following photoexcitation of molecules in a condensed phase is essential to predict the outcome and improve the efficiency of photoinduced molecular processes. Here, the vibrational decoherence and energy relaxation of a binuclear complex, [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4&#8722; (PtPOP), upon electronic excitation in liquid water and acetonitrile are investigated through direct adiabatic dynamics simulations. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is used where the excited state of the complex is modeled with orbital-optimized density functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using potential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt&#8211;Pt vibration dominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be &#8764;1.6 ps in both solvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in water, where intersystem crossing is slow (&amp;gt;10 ps). Pathways for the flow of excess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on vibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the velocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces. Excess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through short-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and surrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute&#8211;solvent interactions involving the Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the excess energy into Pt&#8211;Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is inefficient. This study reveals the mechanism behind the exceptionally long vibrational coherence of the photoexcited PtPOP complex in solution and underscores the importance of short-range interactions for accurate simulations of vibrational energy relaxation of solvated molecules.</description>

      <title>Inert Copper Incorporation Enables the High Activity and Durability of NiW Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202405127</link>

                Abstract The slow reaction kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on existing catalysts in alkaline hinders the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). In this work, a Cu&#8208;incorporated NiW alloy (Cu i &#8208;NiW) without any platinum group metal (PGM) is designed and evaluated in both liquid cells and AEMFCs. This catalyst enabled the achievement of an electrochemical surface area&#8208;normalized exchange current density of 70 &#181;A cm &#8722;2 and robust stability, outperforming most PGM&#8208;free catalysts. Furthermore, the incorporation of Cu into other systems such as NiMo and NiV using the same method also showcased excellent HOR activity and durability. The fuel cells assembled with Cu i &#8208;NiW as the anode and Pt/C or Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C as the cathode delivered peak power densities of 480 and 340 mW cm &#8722;2 , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the incorporated Cu is chemically inert but enhances the overall oxidation resistance of the catalysts. Moreover, it weakens hydrogen adsorption and promotes the adsorption of hydroxide ions, thereby enhancing the HOR activity significantly. These results may open a door for rational design of high&#8208;performance and durable PGM&#8208;free HOR catalysts.</description>

                Colloidal nanocrystals inherently undergo structural changes during chemical reactions. The robust structure-property relationships, originating from their nanoscale dimensions, underscore the significance of comprehending the dynamic structural behavior of nanocrystals in reactive chemical media. Moreover, the complexity and heterogeneity inherent in their atomic structures require tracking of structural transitions in individual nanocrystals at three-dimensional (3D) atomic resolution. In this study, we introduce the method of time-resolved Brownian tomography to investigate the temporal evolution of the 3D atomic structures of individual nanocrystals in solution. The methodology is applied to examine the atomic-level structural transformations of Pt nanocrystals during oxidative etching. The time-resolved 3D atomic maps reveal the structural evolution of dissolving Pt nanocrystals, transitioning from a crystalline to a disordered structure. Our study demonstrates the emergence of a phase at the nanometer length scale that has received less attention in bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Conformational Space of a Sulfonyl-Based Ionic Liquid on Platinum-Based Mono and Bimetallic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c03883</link>

                Understanding the arrangement of ionic liquids at the interface and their interactions with the surface is crucial for enhancing selectivity in heterogeneous reactions for practical applications. In this study, we investigate the nature of the adsorption and structural orientations of a sulfonyl-based ionic liquid on platinum-based mono- and bimetallic (111) surfaces employing replica exchange molecular dynamics and first-principles density functional theory calculations. More than 30 confirmations of the ionic liquid are identified on both monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. In addition to adsorption energies, factors such as dynamics of ionic liquids, molecule-surface distances, and charge transfer analyses are found to be important indicators for understanding adsorption phenomena. The sulfonyl anion exhibits contrasting behavior on the two surfaces, showing a preference for chemisorption on the monometallic surface, while the pyrrolidinium cation is physisorbed on both metal surfaces. Both metal surfaces are negatively charged primarily because of charge transfer from the sulfonyl anion. The analysis of the orientational preference reveals a nearly flat orientation of the cation on the monometallic surface, while a tilted orientation is observed on the bimetallic surface.</description>

                Detailed atomic-scale understanding is a crucial prerequisite for rational design of next-generation single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, the sub-&#229;ngstr&#246;m precision needed for systematic studies is challenging to achieve on common SACs. Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic system featuring Fe-N4 single-atom sites, where the metal-organic structure is modulated by 0.4 &#197; corrugation of an inert graphene/Ir(111) support. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we show that the support corrugation significantly affects the reactivity of the system, as the sites above the support "valleys" bind TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane) significantly stronger than the sites above the "hills". The experimental temperature stability of TCNQ varies by more than 60 &#176;C, while computations indicate more than 0.3 eV variation of TCNQ adsorption energy across the Fe-N4 sites placed atop different regions of the corrugated graphene unit cell. The origin of this effect is steric hindrance, which plays a role whenever large molecules interact with neighboring single-atom catalyst sites or when multiple reactants coadsorb on such sites. Our work demonstrates that such effects can be quantitatively studied using model SAC systems supported on chemically inert and physically corrugated supports.</description>

                Magneto-ionics, which refers to the modification of the magnetic properties of materials through electric-field-induced ion migration, is emerging as one of the most promising methods to develop nonvolatile energy-efficient memory and spintronic and magnetoelectric devices. Herein, the controlled generation of ferromagnetism from paramagnetic Co&#8211;Ni oxide patterned microdisks (prepared upon thermal oxidation of metallic microdisks with dissimilar Co&#8211;Ni ratios, i.e., Ni25Co75 and Ni50Co50) is demonstrated under the action of voltage. The effect is related to the partial reduction of the oxide phases to their metallic forms. Samples richer in Co show stronger magneto-ionic activity, which manifests in lower-onset threshold voltages, faster switching rates, and larger values of the attained saturation magnetization. By means of scanning electron microscopy, a cobalt segregation phenomenon has been experimentally observed upon thermal oxidation, which has been theoretically discussed from the diffusivities' viewpoint. X-ray diffraction characterization has revealed transitions between purely mixed Ni and Co oxides, in the OFF state, to a mixture of oxide and metallic phases, in the ON state, because of the oxygen ion motion outward/inward the Co&#8211;Ni oxide microdisks, depending on the voltage polarity. Ab initio calculations reveal that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy migration is lower in CoO than in NiO, in agreement with the obtained magneto-ionic responses. The observation of magneto-ionic effects in patterned disks (and not only in archetypical continuous films) is a step further for the practical utilization of this phenomenon in real miniaturized devices.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have the potential to act as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts for the oxygen&#8208;redox reactions in metal&#8208;air batteries. However, achieving both high performance and stability in these SACs has been challenging. Here, a novel and facile synthesis method is used to create cobalt&#8208;doped&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon structures (Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) containing cobalt&#8208;SACs by carbonizing a modified ZIF&#8208;11. HAADF&#8208;STEM images and EXAFS spectra confirmed that the structure with the lowest cobalt concentration contains single cobalt atoms coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (Co&#8208;N&#8324;). Electrochemical tests showed that this electrocatalyst performed exceptionally well in both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (E1/2 &#8776; 0.859 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (Ej = 10: 1.544 V), with excellent stability. When used as a bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in the air cathode of a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB), a peak power density of 178.6.1 mW cm &#8722;2 , a specific capacity of 799 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 and a cycle&#8208;life of 1580 is achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the concentration and the position of the pyridinic nitrogen with Co play a critical role in determining the overpotential of this electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;redox reactions. The unprecedented performance of this electrocatalyst can bring paradigm changes in the practical realization and application of metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

                Abstract In this study, we identified features with the largest contributions and property trends in predicting the adsorption energies of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen adsorbates on transition metal (TM) surfaces by performing Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;based calculations and Machine Learning (ML) regression models. From 26 monometallic and 400 bimetallic fcc(111) TM surfaces obtained from Catalysis&#8208;hub.org, three datasets consisting of fourteen elemental, electronic, and structural properties were generated using DFT calculations, site calculations, and online databases. The number of features was reduced using feature selection and then finely&#8208;tuned random forest regression (RFR), gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were implemented for adsorption energy prediction. Finally, model&#8208;agnostic interpretation methods such as permutation feature importance (PFI) and shapely additive explanations (SHAP) provided rankings of feature contributions and directional trends. For all datasets, RFR and GPR demonstrated the highest prediction accuracies. In addition, interpretation methods demonstrated that the largest contributing features and directional trends in the regression models were consistent with structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships of TMs like the d&#8208;band model, the Friedel model, and higher&#8208;fold adsorption sites. Overall, this interpretable ML&#8211;DFT approach can be applied to TMs and their derivatives for atomic adsorption energy prediction and model explainability.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen plays a key role in maximizing the benefits of renewable energy, and the widespread adoption of water electrolyzers and fuel cells, which convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and electrical energy into each other, is strongly desired. Electrocatalysts used in these devices, typically in the form of nanoparticles, are crucial components because they significantly affect cell performance, but their raw materials rely on limited resources. In catalyst research, electrochemical experimental studies using model catalysts, such as single&#8208;crystal electrodes, have provided valuable information on reaction and degradation mechanisms, as well as catalyst development strategies aimed at overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and durability, across spatial scales ranging from the atomic to the nanoscale. Traditionally, these experiments are conducted using well&#8208;defined, simple model surfaces like bare single&#8208;crystal electrodes in pure systems. However, in recent years, experimental methods using more complex interfaces&#8212;while still precisely controlling elemental distribution, microstructure, and modification patterns&#8212;have been established. This paper reviews the history of those studies focusing on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions, which account for the majority of efficiency losses in fuel cells and water electrolyzers, respectively. Furthermore, potential future research themes in experimental studies using model electrodes are identified.</description>

      <title>Electronic descriptors for designing high-entropy alloy electrocatalysts by leveraging local chemical environments</title>

      <description>Guolin Cao, Sha Yang, Ji&#8208;Chang Ren, Wei Liu, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407065902

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a vast compositional space for fine-tuning electrocatalytic activities, leveraging millions of distinct active sites on the surface. However, the intricate local chemical environment poses challenges to the rational and efficient design of HEA electrocatalysts with high reactivity. Here, focusing on noble-metal HEAs for oxygen reduction reactions, we propose a straightforward yet effective descriptor for quantitively determining the local reactivities of HEAs. This descriptor is based on a linear combination of the intrinsic d-band filling of the active center and the neighborhood electronegativity. Our model offers an accurate and robust description of the binding strengths of intermediates with different adsorption configurations on HEAs, supported by external density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the local environmental electronegativity of the HEA surface is strongly related to the d-band profile of the center atom(s) embedded within. Finally, we establish a library of activity maps for HEAs encompassing nine noble-metal elements, suggesting that Pd-rich and Ir-rich alloys, such as Pd&#8211;Ag, Ir&#8211;Pt, Ir&#8211;Au compositions, hold promise as potential candidates for optimal electrocatalysts. High entropy alloys hold promises for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction. Here, the authors develop a straightforward yet effective descriptor for rational designing high entropy alloy electrocatalysts with the aid of surface local chemical environments.</description>

      <title>O&#8208;Bridged Co&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst Synergistically Triggers Interfacial Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer: A New Approach to Sustainable Decontamination</title>

                Abstract Heteroatom&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), featuring more flexible active sites and intermetallic interaction, provide an opportunity for sustainable environmental remediation. Herein, an innovative oxygen&#8208;bridged Co&#8208;Cu DAC supported on nano&#8208;alumina (CoOCu&#8208;DAC) is fabricated using a straightforward two&#8208;step process. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst significantly enhances both decontamination kinetics and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) utilization efficiency by 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude toward monoethanolamine (MEA, p K a = 9.5) compared to Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;SAC) and bulk metal catalysts, and largely outperforms previously reported systems. In&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;FTIR and theoretical investigations reveal that the secondary introduction of Cu plays multiple important roles: it activates lattice oxygen to trigger key proton transfer (PT) of MEAH + via nucleophilic attack at the interface and subsequently favors deprotonated MEA as an efficient electron donor to accelerate electron transfer (ET) by enhancing orbital overlaps for the co&#8208;activation of O 2 and PMS. Such a stepwise proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET)&#8208;enhanced catalytic pathway mediated by CoOCu&#8208;DAC is fundamentally different from common route identified in Co&#8208;SAC&#8208;involved Fenton&#8208;like system. The established binary QSAR further substantiates the universality of PCET&#8208;enhanced strategy toward versatile nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds. This study offers a new perspective for sustainable water decontamination and other related areas of catalysis based on rationalized design of multifunctional catalysts at atomic level.</description>

      <title>Continuous Electrochemical Carbon Capture via Redox-Mediated pH Swing&#9472;Experimental Performance and Process Modeling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c03111</link>

                We investigate a continuous electrochemical pH-swing method to capture CO2 from a gas phase. The electrochemical cell consists of a single cation-exchange membrane (CEM) and a recirculation of a mixture of salt and phenazine-based redox-active molecules. In the absorption compartment, this solution is saturated by CO2 from a mixed gas phase at high pH. In the electrochemical cell, pH is reduced, and CO2 is selectively released in a desorption step. We investigate the influence of redox molecule concentration on the charge storage capacity of the solution, as well as the impact of current density and solution recirculation rate on process performance. A theoretical framework, based on a minimal set of assumptions, is established. This framework describes the data very accurately and can be used for system design and optimization. We evaluate the trade-off between energy consumption and CO2 capture rate and compare with published reports. We report a low energy consumption of 32 kJ/mol of CO2 at a capture rate of 39 mmol/m2/min.</description>

      <title>A Vanadium Redox Flow Process for Carbon Capture and Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsestengg.4c00631</link>

                Climate change mitigation by decreasing worldwide CO2 emissions is an urgent and demanding challenge that requires innovative technical solutions. This work, inspired by vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB), introduces an integrated electrochemical process for carbon capture and energy storage. It utilizes established vanadium and ferricyanide redox couples for pH modulation for CO2 desorption and absorbent regeneration. The developed process consumes electricity during the daytime&#9472;when renewable electricity is available&#9472;to desorb CO2 and charge the cell, and it can regenerate the absorbent for further CO2 absorption while releasing electricity to the grid during nighttime when solar power is unavailable. This research explores the process fundamentals and scalability potential, through an extensive study of the system's thermodynamics, transport phenomena, kinetics, and bench-scale operations. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to study the thermodynamics of the process, mapping the redox profiles to identify ideal potential windows for operation. The CV results indicated that an overpotential of approximately 0.3 V was required for driving redox reactions. Additionally, polarization studies were conducted to select the practical operating potential, identifying 0.5 V as optimal for the CO2 desorption cycle to provide sufficient polarity to overcome activation barriers in addition to the Nernstian potential. Mass transfer analysis balanced conductivity and desorption efficiency, with a 1:1 ratio identified as optimal for redox-active species and background electrolyte concentration. To further enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions, plasma treatment of electrode surfaces was implemented, resulting in a 43% decrease in charge transfer resistance, as measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Finally, a bench-scale operation of the system demonstrated an energy consumption of 54 kJ/mol CO2, which is competitive with other electrochemical carbon capture technologies. Besides its energy competitiveness, the process offers multiple additional advantages, including the elimination of precious metal electrodes, oxygen insensitivity in flue gas, scalability inspired by VRFB technology, and the unique ability to function as a battery during the absorbent regeneration process, enabling efficient day-night operation.</description>

      <title>Surface Structure Effects on H and O Adsorption on Gold, Nickel and Platinum Nanoparticles</title>

                Using quantum chemical modelling, in this work, we considered the structure effects determining the adsorption of H and O atoms on (111), (100), (110) and (211) surfaces of gold, nickel and platinum nanoparticles. Surface deformation enhanced the adatom bonding to active sites with a large coordination number on flat (111) and (100) surfaces, while no distinct tendency was observed on kinked (110) and (211) surfaces. The effect of the neighboring atoms depends on the coupling matrix element Vad2. For metals with a considerable matrix element, the adsorption energy decreases with the rise in coordination number, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Structure Prediction of Ionic Epitaxial Interfaces with Ogre Demonstrated for Colloidal Heterostructures of Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c12713</link>

                Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers exciting opportunities to create a wide variety of functional heterostructures. However, assessing structural compatibility&#9472;the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth&#9472;is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters and crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end, we implemented developments tailored for the high-efficiency prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include the use of pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and the use of a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically calculated based on the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for perovskite-based CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in excellent agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Finally, combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface, and to assign a structure to several other reported metal halide- and oxide-based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</description>
