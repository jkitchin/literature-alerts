      <title>Cobalt oxide-based catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reactions</title>

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a cornerstone technology for green hydrogen production, yet the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains a major bottleneck. Noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2 are effective but suffer from high cost and scarcity. As a non-precious alternative, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has attracted attention due to its promising performance results from its mixed-valence structure, tunable electronic properties and catalytic potential. However, its practical application is challenged by poor conductivity, moderate activity and instability under acidic conditions due to proton attack and lattice degradation. This review summarises recent advances in Co3O4-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER. We first introduce three key OER pathways: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and oxide path mechanism (OPM) and their relevance to Co3O4 performance. Then, we introduce the structural and electronic characteristics of Co3O4 that influence its catalytic behaviour. Next, we review a range of engineering strategies, including element doping, heterostructure construction, surface modification and defect engineering, all aimed at enhancing the activity and durability of Co3O4. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and offer perspectives for advancing Co3O4 as a viable acidic OER catalyst.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Engineering Induced Charge Accumulation for Enhanced Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202519825</link>

                Abstract Efficient separation and extraction of charge carriers at the surface of semiconductor photoanodes play a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. Herein, a general strategy is presented to promote charge carrier migration by introducing a hole extraction layer, which enables dual&#8208;interface engineering between the photoanode and the catalytic sites. This design enhances the transfer and accumulation of photogenerated holes from the semiconductor to the oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC). Specifically, FeNi&#8208;LDH is inserted between &#945;&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 and a Ru&#8208;based OEC, forming a cascaded &#945;&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 /FeNi&#8208;LDH/Ru structure. This dual&#8208;interface configuration facilitates directional charge transport, accelerates hole accumulation at Ru active sites, and suppresses carrier recombination. The optimized photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.51 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus RHE, which is 3.8 times higher than that of pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 . This work highlights the crucial role of rational interface engineering in regulating carrier dynamics and provides a broadly applicable strategy for constructing high&#8208;efficiency PEC water&#8208;splitting systems.</description>

      <title>Electron Spin Polarization Facilitates the Urea Oxidation Reaction</title>

                Abstract This work reports on the role of electron spin in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), which is important for wastewater treatment and for hydrogen production in energy applications, as it possesses a lower thermodynamic equilibrium potential to produce hydrogen than does direct water splitting. We demonstrate that spin&#8208;polarized catalysts facilitate the UOR, leading to a decrease in reaction overpotential and an improved product distribution compared to analogous unpolarized catalysts. Computational studies attribute the improved performance to a stabilization of the desired reaction pathway upon spin polarization. This work underscores the importance of electron spin considerations for multistep, multielectron and multiproton, electrochemical reactions.</description>

                Through atomic-scale characterization of a single cobalt atom anchored in a pyridinic N3 vacancy of graphene (Co-N3-gra), this study computationally explores three interconnected functionalities mediated by cobalt&#8217;s electronic configuration. Quantum-confined molecular prototypes extend prior bulk models, achieving a competitive catalytic activity for CO oxidation via Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathways with a 0.85 eV barrier. These molecular prototypes&#8217; discrete energy states facilitate single-electron transistor operation, enabling sensitive detection of NO, NO2, SO2, and CO2 through adsorption-induced conductance modulation. When applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries using periodic Co-N3-gra, cobalt sites enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect, with the Li2S2&#8594;Li2S step identified as the rate-limiting process. Density functional simulations provide atomic-scale physicochemical characterization of Co-N3-gra, revealing how defect engineering in 2D materials modulates electronic structures for multifunctional applications.</description>

                Developing efficient, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) remains a significant challenge, requiring the stabilization and enhancement of catalyst activity under harsh conditions. Here, we present cobalt-doped ruthenium dioxide (Co0.3Ru0.7O2) on TiO2 as an electrocatalyst toward an acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The Co0.3Ru0.7O2&#8211;TiO2 achieves an impressive overpotential of 322 mV at 1 A cm&#8211;2 and demonstrates stable operation for over 1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2 in a PEMWE device. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical calculation results demonstrate that the doping of Co atoms into the rutile RuO2 lattice optimizes the geometric configuration. Moreover, the lattice-matched interface between Co0.3Ru0.7O2 and TiO2 promotes interfacial electron redistribution and stabilizes active centers under oxidative conditions. This facilitates a dual-site fully parallel oxidation (DFO) pathway in which intermediates are synchronously adsorbed and desorbed at Ru and Co sites, enabling direct O&#8211;O coupling. This work highlights the synergistic effect of the Ru&#8211;Co dual sites and TiO2 support in establishing a stable, self-regulating electronic environment that drives efficient intermediate transformation via the DFO mechanism.</description>

                The low-cost generation of green hydrogen (H2) via water electrolysis depends on advances in catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Although palladium and nickel nanoparticles have demonstrated potential catalytic performance, the exact interplay between particle size and composition in their binary forms remains an unresolved issue. Here, we explore NimPdn&#8211;m nanoclusters consisting of 13 and 27 atoms to improve our atomistic understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of HER at a nanoscale regime. We used the putative global minimum structure of the bare clusters and employed data mining techniques to generate and select preferential hydrogen adsorption structures. The electronic and geometrical properties are predicted using a cost-effective calculation protocol, based on density functional theory calculations with the PBE functional including van der Waals corrections. The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model was employed to calculate Gibbs free energies. We found that atomic H adsorbs on bridge and hollow sites in the 13-atom clusters and only on hollow sites in the 27-atom clusters. The effects of size and composition on the adsorption energies are also calculated, and their relation to the bulk values is presented. Our results on the Gibbs free energy for the HER reaction suggest that, at the subnanometer scale, the most promising catalysts are obtained when earth-abundant nickel clusters are doped with a small percentage of palladium, which has potential application for cost reduction. For instance, Ni10Pd3 shows a &#916;G of &#8722;0.35 eV, while Ni13 and Pd13 unary counterparts present &#8722;0.51 and &#8722;0.47 eV, respectively. An analysis of electron density reveals that within these NimPdn&#8211;m nanoclusters, a substantial charge transfer from the cluster to the hydrogen atom is correlated with lower values of &#916;G. This observation implies that charge transfer is a significant factor in the HER.</description>

      <title>Chromium Cation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Reconstruction of a Stable and High Performance Boride&#8208;derived Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Abstract The rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), holds the key to advancing the overall electrolytic water splitting performance. Here, a scalable one&#8208;pot synthesis of a stable chromium&#9472;iron nickel boride (Cr&#9472;FeNiB) electrocatalyst is reported for OER in which nickel&#8208;boron sites are micro&#8208;environmentally modified through interactions with iron and chromium. Comprehensive, correlative electrochemical, structural, and chemical analyses reveal the formation of amorphous&#8208;crystalline core&#8208;shell structures that transform into nanosheets upon activation with enhanced water oxidation catalytic activity. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the chromium&#8208;induced chemical self&#8208;reconstruction of the catalyst, which facilitates favorable OER kinetics, increased turnover frequency, and a synergistic effect between metal and boron constituents. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation showed that chromium incorporation effectively shifts the d &#8208;band centers ( &#603; d ) closer to the Fermi level and narrows the metal&#8208;d/boron&#8208;p band center gap (&#916; &#603; d&#8208;p ) (Ni 2 B 1.10 eV &#8594; FeNiB 0.71 eV &#8594; Cr&#9472;FeNiB 0.55 eV) ultimately enhancing OER activity. Accordingly, the &#916; &#603; d&#8208;p is established as a key electronic descriptor for predicting and optimizing OER performance. These findings pave the way for a better understanding of metal boride&#8208;derived electrocatalysts and also contribute to the development of efficient, stable, earth&#8208;abundant, non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract All solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries offer a transformative opportunity for more sustainable energy storage, with the potential to significantly improve both energy density and safety compared to conventional sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges such as dendrite formation and limited ion conductivity. In this study, a novel strategy is proposed in which Sc 3+ and Mg 2+ dopants are directly introduced into the Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 solid&#8208;state electrolyte (NZSP SSE) to optimize composition and regulate interfacial chemistry. The resulting co&#8208;doped electrolyte, Na 3.7 Zr 1.45 Sc 0.4 Mg 0.15 Si 2 PO 12 (NSZSP&#8208;0.15Mg), exhibits a significantly enhanced ionic conductivity of 1.3 mS cm &#8722;1 at room temperature and improved interfacial compatibility. Moreover, symmetric Na//NSZSP&#8208;0.15Mg//Na cells demonstrate stable Na stripping/plating for over 400 h (0.5 mA cm &#8722;2 , 0.5 mAh cm &#8722;2 ), attributed to the formation of a dynamically stable ScPO 4 /Mg 3 (PO 4 ) 2 &#8208;rich interphase layer at the Na metal/SSE interface. Furthermore, Na//NSZSP&#8208;0.15Mg//Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 full cell batteries exhibit excellent rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 75 mAh g &#8722;1 over 3000 cycles at 2 C at room temperature. This work presents a robust approach for enabling practical solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries with high conductivity, enhanced interfacial stability, high energy density, and long&#8208;term cyclability, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation SSEs for high&#8208;performance sodium metal batteries.</description>

                Abstract Dynamic liquid metal alloys have been promising for catalytic green hydrogen (H 2 ) production through methane pyrolysis. Owing to their atomic mobility, liquid metal catalysts have a fluidic atomic structure in which obtaining reaction energies and kinetic barriers hinges on reliable geometrical descriptions of atomic arrangements. Here, the catalytic reaction mechanism for methane pyrolysis on the surface of molten Ga&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ni as the catalyst is investigated, using an approach based on fully dynamic sampling of ab initio molecular dynamic trajectories. The results reveal that the adsorption energy for the first C&#9472;H bond breaking in methane is notably enhanced from 2.2 eV on liquid Ga to 1.2 eV on molten Ga&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ni. The mobility of dissolved Fe and Ni atoms plays a critical role for activation of Ga atoms on the alloy surface, facilitating charge transferring from solvent atoms (electron donor) to solute atoms (electron acceptor), thereby modulating electronic structure. The dissociated hydrogen atoms, with a low kinetic barrier of approximately 0.6 eV computed via the blue moon ensemble method, can easily bond together, desorbing as H 2 molecules from the surface. Our findings highlight that mobile dissolved species in liquid metal matrix can bestow unique catalytic activity to solvent atoms by modifying electronic structure.</description>

                Engineering grain boundary (GB) strain provides a promising pathway to tune the catalytic properties of nanocrystals. However, structural heterogeneity from random grain orientation and geometry has limited clear structure&#8211;property correlations. Here, we utilize a multigrain Co3O4/Mn3O4 core/shell nanocrystal platform as a model system to systematically investigate how geometric misfit strain at GBs serves as catalytically active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. Through precise subnanometer-level control over grain morphology and by integrating multiscale electronic structure characterization, we identify the electronic structural signature of GB defects and establish a direct correlation between localized strain fields and modified electronic states. Strain modulation at GBs alters the eg orbital energy levels, with elongation along the z-axis combined with shear strain stabilizing the eg states, in contrast to the destabilization observed under pure shear strain. This stabilization mechanism enhances the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of strained GBs compared with strain-relaxed grain surfaces. Furthermore, we reveal that GBs exhibit a radial strain gradient, producing a spatial energy shift that further modulates local electronic structures, as resolved through the classification of electron energy loss spectroscopy data. Together, these findings demonstrate that geometric misfit strain enables precise tuning of grain geometry and the resulting electronic structures, offering a robust strategy for engineering next-generation nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Are Hemilabile Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Overlooked as Promising Water-Stable Adsorbents? Elucidating Their Physical and Hydrolytic Properties Using Machine-Learned Potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c07377</link>
      <description>Yifei Yue, Athulya S. Palakkal, N. Duane Loh, Jianwen Jiang, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414495489

                Poor water stability of many metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a persistent bottleneck toward their practical applications. Hemilabile STAMs (St. Andrews Materials) demonstrate greater water stability, as well as improved adsorption performance under humid conditions, compared to compositionally similar HKUST-1. Yet, the fundamental properties of STAMs remain largely unexplored. Herein, we leverage machine-learned potentials (MLPs) to simulate physical and hydrolytic properties, water stability and adsorption in STAMs functionalized with various hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups. Encouragingly, STAMs are predicted to exhibit high mechanical strength and low heat capacity, which are desirable attributes in adsorption processes. Moreover, defective STAMs are shown to possess greater mechanical robustness than defective HKUST-1. From MLP-based molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that Cu-paddlewheels of STAMs are relatively stable even at high water loadings. The hydrolysis mechanism of Cu-paddlewheels is examined meticulously, and for the first time, we quantitatively reveal a higher energy barrier is required to hydrolyze Cu&#8211;O bonds in STAMs than in HKUST-1, unambiguously elucidating the crucial role of Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;OH2 interactions in water stability of hemilabile STAMs. From MLP-based Monte Carlo simulations, water adsorption isotherms predicted in STAMs match well with experimental data. Importantly, it is concretely demonstrated that water adsorption in the hexagonal pore can be tailored by modifying the hydrophobicity of functional groups, while adsorption in the triangular pore is affected marginally. Beyond showing that STAMs are promising adsorbents, we provide new microscopic insights into physical and hydrolytic properties in Cu paddlewheel-based MOFs. More generally, our findings suggest that incorporating hemilability is a promising but underexplored strategy for the development of new water-stable MOFs.</description>

                Training machine learning interatomic potentials that are both computationally and data-efficient is a key challenge for enabling their routine use in atomistic simulations. To this effect, we introduce franken, a scalable and lightweight transfer learning framework that extracts atomic descriptors from pre-trained graph neural networks and transfers them to new systems using random Fourier features - an efficient and scalable approximation of kernel methods. It also provides a closed-form fine-tuning strategy for general-purpose potentials such as MACE-MP0, enabling fast and accurate adaptation to new systems or levels of quantum mechanical theory with minimal hyperparameter tuning. On a benchmark dataset of 27 transition metals, franken outperforms optimized kernel-based methods in both training time and accuracy, reducing model training from tens of hours to minutes on a single GPU. We further demonstrate the framework's strong data-efficiency by training stable and accurate potentials for bulk water and the Pt(111)/water interface using just tens of training structures. Our open-source implementation (https://franken.readthedocs.io) offers a fast and practical solution for training potentials and deploying them for molecular dynamics simulations across diverse systems.</description>

                While nickel-based layered oxide cathodes offer promising energy and power densities in lithium-ion batteries, they suffer from instability when fully delithiated upon charge. Ex situ studies often report a structural degradation of the charged cathode materials, but the precise mechanism is still poorly understood on the atomic scale. In this work, we combine high-level ab initio calculations with molecular dynamics using machine-learning interatomic potentials to study structural degradation of fully delithiated LiNiO2 surfaces at the top of charge. We find a previously unreported, stable reconstruction of the (012) facet with more facile oxygen loss compared to the pristine surfaces. The oxygen vacancy formation energy closely corresponds to the experimental decomposition temperatures of charged cathodes. Furthermore, we use molecular dynamics simulations to sample Ni ion migration into alkali-layer sites that is a kinetically plausible initiation step for surface degradation toward thermodynamically stable products.</description>

      <title>Entropy Governs the Structure and Reactivity of Water Dissociation Under Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12397</link>
      <description>Yair Litman, Angelos Michaelides, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414524000

                The response of water to electric fields is critical to the performance and stability of electrochemical devices, and the selectivity of enzymatic, atmospheric, and organic reactions. A key process in this context is the water (auto)dissociation reaction (WD), which governs acid&#8211;base aqueous chemistry and shapes reaction rates and mechanisms. Despite its significance, the thermodynamics of the WD reaction in electrified environments remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the WD reaction under external electric fields using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations within the framework of the modern theory of polarization. Our results reveal that strong electric fields dramatically enhance the WD reaction, increasing the equilibrium constant by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, we show that the applied field transforms the WD reaction from an entropically hindered process to an entropy-driven one. Analysis shows that this is because the electric field alters the tendency of ions to be structure makers or structure breakers. By highlighting how strong electric fields reshape solvent organization and reactivity, this work opens new avenues for designing aqueous electro-catalysts that leverage solvent entropy to enhance their performance.</description>

      <title>Electrosynthesis of NH3 from low-concentration NO on cascade dual-site catalysts in neutral media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63365-7</link>
      <description>Xiaoxi Guo, Tongwei Wu, Hengfeng Li, Yanning Zhang, Chao Ma, Hongmei Li, Liyuan Chai, Haitao Zhao, Min Liu, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414533656

                Electrosynthesis of NH3 from low-concentration NO (NORR) in neutral media offers a sustainable nitrogen fixation strategy but is hindered by weak NO adsorption, slow water dissociation, and sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Herein, we propose an intriguing strategy that successfully overcomes these limitations through using an electron-donating motif to modulate NO-affinitive catalysts, thereby creating dual active site with synergistic functionality. Specifically, we integrate electron-donating nanoparticles into a Fe single-atom catalyst (FeSAC), where Fe sites ensure strong NO adsorption, while electron-donating motifs promote water dissociation and NO hydrogenation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and theoretical calculations reveal that electron-donating motifs increase Fe site electron density, strengthening NO adsorption. Additionally, these motifs also promote water dissociation, supplying protons to lower the NO hydrogenation barrier. This synergistic interplay enables a cascade reaction mechanism, delivering a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 90.3% and a NH3 yield rate of 709.7 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 under 1.0 vol% NO in neutral media, outperforming pure FeSAC (NH3 yield rate: 444.2 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1, FE: 56.6%) and prior to systems operating under high NO concentrations. Notably, the high NH3 yield of 3207.7 &#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 is achieved in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer under a 1.0 vol% NO. This work establishes an inspirational paradigm in NORR by simultaneously enhancing NO adsorption, water dissociation, and hydrogenation kinetics, providing a scalable route for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from dilute NO sources. Weak NO adsorption, slow water dissociation, and sluggish hydrogenation hinder neutral-media NH3 electrosynthesis from low-concentration NO. Here, the authors report an electron-donating motif modulating a NO-affinitive catalyst to create dual active sites, thus facilitating NO-to-NH3 conversion.</description>

      <title>Nanoindentation simulations for copper and tungsten with adaptive-precision potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/2lkd-l6gt</link>
      <description>David Immel, Matous Mrovec, Ralf Drautz, Godehard Sutmann, Physical Review Materials. 9(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414534797

                We perform nanoindentation simulations for both the prototypical face-centered cubic metal copper and the body-centered cubic metal tungsten with an adaptive-precision description of interaction potentials including different accuracy and computational costs. We combine both a computationally efficient embedded atom method (EAM) potential and a precise but computationally less efficient machine learning potential based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) into an adaptive precision (AP) potential tailored for the nanoindentation. The numerically more expensive ACE potential is employed selectively only in regions of the computational cell where high precision is required. The comparison with pure EAM and pure ACE simulations shows that for Cu, all potentials yield similar dislocation morphologies under the indenter with only small quantitative differences. In contrast, markedly different plasticity mechanisms are observed for W in simulations performed with the central-force EAM potential compared to results obtained using the ACE potential. ACE is able to describe accurately the angular character of bonding, which is in W due to its half-filled d band. All ACE-specific mechanisms are reproduced in the AP nanoindentation simulations, however, with a significant speedup of 20&#8211;30 times compared to the pure ACE simulations. Hence, the AP potential overcomes the performance gap between the precise ACE and the fast EAM potential by combining the advantages of both potentials.</description>

                Carbenes are key intermediates in many chemical applications. The properties of carbenes very much depend on substitution and on the chemical environment such as solvent or surface interactions. In this work, we computationally study cyclopentadienylidene (CP), as an archetypical electrophilic reactive carbene, on three metal surfaces: Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). In addition, we investigate the stable nucleophilic N-heterocyclic carbene imidazolidene (IMI) as a structurally analogous counterpart of CP for comparing the behavior of these two drastically different types of carbene species in the presence of metal surfaces. Our study reveals different adsorption geometries: CP adsorbs tilted; IMI adsorbs perpendicularly on the three surfaces. CP has a much higher adsorption energy on metal surfaces compared to IMI. The adsorption energy of CP follows the tendency Ag &lt; Au &lt; Cu. All metal surfaces induced switching of the ground electronic state of CP from triplet to singlet. The nucleophilic IMI acts as electron donor when adsorbed, with net charge transferred from IMI to the metal surface. The electrophilic CP acts as an electron acceptor, withdrawing net charge from the metal surface. Our study can contribute to engineering new classes of on-surface catalytic systems, based on tailored reactivities of surface-bound carbenes.</description>

      <title>Research on Quantum Circuit Learning Models for Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.5c03624</link>
      <description>Yasutaka Nishida, The Journal of Physical Chemistry A. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414543782

                In the past decade, many hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have been applied to various industrial fields, reflecting the growing interest in NISQ devices. For example, in the field of chemistry, many studies were conducted to calculate the energies of eigenstates with high precision. However, there is still little research on molecular dynamics using quantum computers, because traditional approaches based on variational quantum algorithms are not suitable for the long-time steps of molecular dynamics. In this study, we propose a quantum circuit learning model that estimates the eigenvalues of a given molecular Hamiltonian for an arbitrary molecular configuration. Our model must first be costly to train; however, once trained, the resulting trained model can eliminate procedures that required variational optimization each time the molecular coordinates are updated in the previous variational approach. By using the proposed model, we demonstrate that the proposed model can be used to perform simple molecular dynamics simulations, such as Langevin dynamics and NVE simulation. We also show several applications of our model inspired by classical machine learning.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Droplet Microfluidic Design Framework with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.5c06253</link>
      <description>Duc Minh Nguyen, Raymond Kai-YuTong, Ngoc&#8208;Duy Dinh, ACS Omega. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414554088

                Droplet-based microfluidic devices have substantial promise as cost-effective alternatives to current assessment tools in biological research. Moreover, machine learning models that leverage tabular data, including input design parameters and their corresponding efficiency outputs, are increasingly utilized to automate the design process of these devices and to predict their performance. However, these models fail to fully leverage the data presented in the tables, neglecting crucial contextual information, including column headings and their associated descriptions. This study presents &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs, a framework designed for processing and feature extraction, which effectively captures contextual information from tabular data formats. &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs overcomes processing challenges by transforming the content into a linguistic format and leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) for analysis. We evaluate our &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs framework on prediction tasks utilizing publicly available data sets on droplet microfluidics. We demonstrate that our &#956;-Fluidic-LLMs framework can empower deep neural network models to be highly effective and straightforward while minimizing the need for extensive data preprocessing. When combined with LLMs like LLAMA3.1 and DEEPSEEK-R1, deep neural networks achieve marked improvements, lowering the mean absolute error in generation rate by nearly 40%, reducing the root mean squared error in droplet diameter by around 26%, and enhancing regime classification accuracy by over 3% in comparison with prior results. This study lays the foundation for the huge potential applications of LLMs and machine learning in a wider spectrum of microfluidic applications.</description>

                Abstract In this work, we investigate manganese-doped ZnO catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, combining structural characterization, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD confirms that Mn doping preserves the wurtzite ZnO structure while inducing lattice distortions and vibrational shifts indicative of manganese incorporation. XPS analysis reveals that Mn3&#8314; is the dominant surface species, which is confirmed by x-ray absorption and emission spectroscopic measurements. Electrochemically, Mn-doped ZnO exhibits enhanced catalytic performance, with increased limiting current density and slight improvements in onset potential compared to pure ZnO. DFT calculations indicate that, while the overall thermodynamics of peroxide formation remain similar, the incorporation of Mn significantly stabilizes the *&#8211;OOH intermediate, thereby reducing the energy requirement for this key step. Together, these findings demonstrate that manganese doping improves ORR activity by modifying the electronic structure and enhancing reaction kinetics, offering valuable insights for the design of efficient ZnO-based electrocatalysts for selective H&#8322;O&#8322; production.</description>

                Abstract The electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface governs many functional properties and processes, such as reaction rates, efficiency, and selectivity in electrochemical systems, with its structure and physicochemical phenomena being crucial for optimizing energy conversion and storage technologies. Platinum (Pt) is a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for numerous electrocatalytic reactions. While Pt(111) is extensively studied, atomic&#8208;level insights into interfacial properties of another basic surface, Pt(100), remain unresolved. Here, experimental techniques and first&#8208;principles calculations are utilized to investigate adsorption behavior and adsorbate coverage at varying potentials as well as interfacial entropy in acidic media. The results reveal four voltammetric peak features: below peak I, hydrogen is the predominant adsorbate; between peak II and peak III, a mixed adsorption region with 22% hydroxide and 44% hydrogen forms, while at higher potentials, hydroxide coverage increases. The double&#8208;layer structure is also explored, finding sensitivity of the double&#8208;layer capacitance to electrode surface structure. For the first time, by combining in situ laser&#8208;induced current transient and Raman spectroscopy, two potential values of maximum entropy are identified, indicating enhanced disorder and facilitated charge transfer, supported by disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond network due to increased dangling bonds. These insights guide the rational design of efficient electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces in Pt&#8208;based nanostructured materials.</description>

                The electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) shows considerable potential for its applications in waste removal and the production of clean energy. While Pt remains the most investigated catalyst for this reaction, its limitations have prompted research into Pt&#8208;based bimetallic alloys. This study investigates both uniform and mixed PtM (M = Au, Ir, Pd, Rh, and Ru) alloys as catalysts for the AOR using density functional theory (DFT). A systematic selection method is used to choose suitable surfaces for testing. The findings indicate that the Oswin&#8211;Salomon mechanism is preferred across all surfaces for N 2 (g) formation. Additionally, the results demonstrate that mixed alloys exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to uniform alloys for the AOR. It is found that the atoms in the topmost layer of the alloy are the most significant factor in influencing catalytic activity. Furthermore, the linear relationship between the &#8208;band center and adsorption energy of key intermediate *NH 2 is confirmed in this work, highlighting the effect of the secondary metal on the electronic structure of the catalyst. The findings provide theoretical insights for the design of high&#8208;performance Pt alloys for AOR and serve as a general guideline for modulating the reactivity of binary alloys for electrocatalysis.</description>

      <description>Yihui Bao, Xinyi Lu, Yanyan Xia, Zhencheng Ye, Houyang Chen, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414570643

                Abstract Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images, yet its widespread application remains constrained by the scarcity of annotated training data. While deep generative models offer a promising solution, they typically struggle to reproduce the complex high&#8208;frequency components that define experimental STEM images. Here, STEMDiff, a conditional diffusion model that transforms simple binary labels derived from crystal structures into realistic STEM images through a physical information embedding strategy, is proposed. By developing a novel Discrete Wavelet Transform&#8208;based skip&#8208;connection architecture, the high&#8208;frequency bias inherent in diffusion models are addressed, enabling the preservation of experimental noise characteristics. This approach generates images that are quantitatively nearly indistinguishable from experimental data (17 fold improvement over previous methods) while retaining ground truth structural information. Fully convolutional networks trained exclusively on these synthetic images achieve high&#8208;precision atomic column detection in experimental STEM images of WSe 2 and graphene, despite the presence of substantial background noise and contamination. This approach effectively eliminates the need for laborious manual annotation, providing a scalable solution to the data bottleneck in STEM image analysis. The principles underlying STEMDiff can extend to other scientific imaging modalities, accelerating advancements in materials design for water treatment.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, Alloying Process, and Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Activity of Highly Stable Ni&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo Nanoparticles with a Face&#8208;Centered Cubic Phase</title>

                Abstract Real&#8208;time visualization of alloying evolution is crucial yet challenging for designing and synthesizing face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) nanoalloy catalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a trimetallic fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy is synthesized via topological reduction of NiFeMo layered double hydroxide (LDH) under an Ar/H 2 atmosphere. In situ heating transmission electron microscopy reveals the transforamtion of non&#8208;hexagonal NiFeMo LDH nanosheets into irregular inverse&#8208;spinel Ni 1&#8208;x Mo x Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, eventually forming spherical fcc NiFeMo nanoalloy particles. Furthermore, the NiFeMo nanoalloy demonstrates a Faradaic efficiency of 99.3% and superior intrinsic OER activity compared to NiFe and Ni nanoalloys at a consistent mass loading, due to synergistic metal interactions. The NiFeMo nanoalloy&#8208;modified nickel foam electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability, with structural and elemental analyses confirming that the original fcc structure remains intact after long&#8208;term OER testing. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry coupled with isotope labelling experiment illustrates that the OER on NiFeMo nanoalloy proceeds via an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway. Theoretical calculations suggest that Mo species reduce the potential barriers for *OH intermediate formation, thereby enhancing the inherent activity of Ni active sites in the NiFeMo nanoalloy. This work presents a novel approach for developing advanced trimetallic and high&#8208;entropy nanoalloy OER catalysts.</description>

                We present a response-augmented machine-learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Using &#946;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Monolayer on Ni Electrode with Engineered Oxygen Vacancies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c03585</link>
      <description>Farah Rahman, Abdul Ahad Mamun, Auronno Ovid Hussain, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. 129(38)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414596781

                Developing cost-effective and high-performance electrodes is critical for advancing hydrogen (H2) production through electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we present a novel electrode design by integrating a &#946;-MnO2 monolayer onto a conventional Ni(100) substrate (MnO2(110)/Ni(100)). This work uniquely explores the influence of oxygen vacancies (OVs) at distinct sites&#9472;Osub-top and bridge sites&#9472;on both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our findings reveal that the Osub-top vacancy (OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100)) significantly enhances HER activity, achieving a hydrogen Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of &#8722;0.015 eV, which surpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt/C (&#8722;0.082 eV) and Ir (&#8722;0.08 eV). Additionally, the cathodic exchange current density (J0,c) of OOV-MnO2(110)/Ni(100) reaches 10&#8211;0.774 Acm&#8211;2, outperforming Pt/C (10&#8211;0.92 Acm&#8211;2) and Ir (10&#8211;1.44 Acm&#8211;2). Electrochemical analysis confirms a cathodic activation overpotential (&#951;a,c) of 0.141 V at 10 mAcm&#8211;2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, achieving a hydrogen production rate (HPR) of 0.91 mmolh&#8211;1cm&#8211;2 at an applied voltage (Vapp) of 1.60 V. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of site-specific oxygen vacancy effects on bifunctional MnO2-based electrodes, demonstrating superior HER activity while maintaining dual functionality for both cathodic and anodic processes. Our results highlight the potential of engineered oxygen vacancies to develop low-cost, high-efficiency electrodes for sustainable hydrogen production, offering a competitive alternative to precious metal-based catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) materials are promising non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet their long&#8208;term stability remains a critical challenge due to the dissolution of Fe&#8208;based active sites and corrosion of the carbon support. Here, a Fe&#8208;Zr dual&#8208;atom carbon&#8208;based catalyst (Fe,Zr&#8208;NC) via a one&#8208;step solid&#8208;state synthesis method is reported. The introduction of atomically dispersed Zr&#8211;N units adjacent to Fe&#8211;N 4 centers creates a dual&#8208;metal coordination structure that modulates the local electronic environment of Fe and weakens * OH adsorption, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step in the ORR process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;Zr synergy positions the catalyst near the apex of the ORR activity volcano. Extended experimental EXAFS confirms a Fe&#8211;Zr distance of &#8776;3.30 &#197;, closely matching the theoretical optimum (&#8776;3.39 &#197;). As a result, Fe, Zr&#8208;NC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential (0.891 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with negligible activity loss over 5000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, outperforming commercial Pt/C. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, the catalyst delivers a peak power density of 185.7 mW cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for over 453 h. This work highlights the importance of dual&#8208;atom synergy in tuning intermediate binding energies and provides design principles for next&#8208;generation ORR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Surface-Dependent Interfacial Concentration of Oxygen Confined within Pd Interlayers: Molecular Dynamics with a Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c15915</link>
      <description>Feicheng Huan, Feng Shi, Gaoyang Luo, Xiang Pan, Jingnan Zheng, Jianguo Wang, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414542564

                Obtaining a detailed understanding of the interfacial dynamics of oxygen on palladium surfaces is crucial for industrial applications. However, it remains challenging to develop reaction&#8211;transport coupling mechanisms to enhance the activity and stability of Pd-based catalysts in confined environments. Herein, by integrating the established global neural network (G-NN) potential and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the interfacial concentrations of confined O2 molecules within Pd interlayers were investigated systematically under various conditions. The developed reactive NN potential, rigorously validated against DFT benchmarks with an average error of 0.026 eV/atom, demonstrated precise structural discrimination capabilities among three Pd surfaces and subsequently produced reasonable catalytic structures. The Pd(100) surface exhibited the highest reactivity, followed by Pd(211), with the lowest on Pd(111). These differences show strong correlations with a reduced interlayer distance (approximately 1 nm) and the degree of surface reconstruction patterns through a comprehensive analysis of mean square displacement and reaction rate. Density distribution, in conjunction with radial distribution function analyses, further demonstrates how the interlayer confinement effect, as well as surface-specific atomic arrangements, remarkably regulate the interfacial concentration of oxygen. This work provides universal guidance for elucidating the macroscopic mechanism linking the bulk and interfacial concentrations in confined systems through large-scale simulations.</description>
