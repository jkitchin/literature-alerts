      <title>Statistical Correlations Between Various Drivers of Energy Demand in Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Retrofitted Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering9010003</link>
      <description>Dalal Alalaiwat, Ezzat Khan, ChemEngineering. 9(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405992158

                Power plants are one of the main sources emitting the CO2 that is responsible for climate change consequences. Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC), particularly using an aqueous solution, is highly recommended to be used as a mitigation solution to reduce the emissions of CO2 from power plants. Although PCC is a promising solution, the process still needs further development to reduce the energy demand for solvent regeneration. This paper reviews the challenges related to the post-combustion processes and finds the correlations between selected variables addressed by several researchers. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the reduction in energy demand and efficiency penalties. The research findings highlight the importance of considering two key drivers during the design of the PCC process. These are the absorber temperature and the type and amount of the selected solvent. Indeed, statistical analyses show that there is a correlation between the identified drivers&#8217; values and the energy demand of solvent regeneration.</description>

      <title>Hierarchically Meso-Macroporous N-Doped Carbon Embedded with CoFe-Based Composite for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acselectrochem.4c00056</link>
      <description>Yu-Lin Li, Yanna Guo, Norihito Ebato, Yusuke Yamauchi, Yoshiyuki Sugahara, ACS electrochemistry.. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405984071

                Remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts have been prepared by assembling bimetallic CoFe nanoparticles on hierarchically meso-macroporous N-doped carbon nanospheres. Metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts are emerging as promising alternatives to Pt/C for ORR; however, their performance is limited by the low density and accessibility of active metal sites. The present hierarchically structured meso-macroporous N-doped carbon provides abundant exposed sites for active metal species. The bimetallic CoFe nanoparticles, in turn, significantly increase the total density of active catalytic sites for ORR. Consequently, the optimized CoFe nanoparticles embedded in meso-macroporous N-doped carbon (CoFe@MesoMacroNC) deliver superior ORR activities in both alkali and acidic media, achieving half-wave potentials of 0.943 V vs RHE and 0.811 V vs RHE, respectively. In addition, when CoFe@MesoMacroNC is used in a Zn&#8211;air battery, it shows a higher power density of 155 mW cm&#8211;2 as compared with that of commercial Pt/C (137 mW cm&#8211;2) as well as better stability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced non-classical electrostriction in strained tetragonal ceria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55393-6</link>
      <description>Simone Santucci, Milica Vasiljevic, Haiwu Zhang, Victor Buratto Tinti, Achilles Bergne, Armando Antonio Morin-Martinez, Sandeep Kumar Chaluvadi, P. Orgiani, Simone Sanna, Anton Lyksborg-Andersen, Thomas W. Hansen, Ivano E. Castelli, Nini Pryds, Vincenzo Esposito, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405986556

                Electrostriction is the upsurge of strain under an electric field in any dielectric material. Oxygen-defective metal oxides, such as acceptor-doped ceria, exhibit high electrostriction 10-17 m2V-2 values, which can be further enhanced via interface engineering at the nanoscale. This effect in ceria is "non-classical" as it arises from an intricate relation between defect-induced polarisation and local elastic distortion in the lattice. Here, we investigate the impact of mismatch strain when epitaxial Gd-doped CeO2 thin films are grown on various single-crystal substrates. We demonstrate that varying the compressive and tensile strain can fine-tune the electromechanical response. The electrostriction coefficients achieve a large M11 &#8776; 3.6&#183;10-15 m2V-2 in lattices of in-plane compressed films, i.e., a positive tetragonality (c/a-1 &gt; 0), with stress above 3 GPa at the film/substrate interface. Chemical and structural analysis suggests that the high electrostriction stems from anisotropic distortions in the local lattice strain, which lead to constructively oriented elastic dipoles and Ce3+ electronic defects. Non-classical electrostriction in fluorites arises from defect-induced polarization and lattice distortions. This study shows that mismatch strain in Gd-doped CeO2 thin films fine-tunes electromechanical responses, achieving high electrostriction above 10&#8722;15 m2V&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Efficient direct formic acid electrocatalysis enabled by rare earth-doped platinum-tellurium heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55612-0</link>
      <description>Xin Lin, Shize Geng, Xianglong Du, Feiteng Wang, Xu Zhang, Fang Xiao, Zhengyi Xiao, Yucheng Wang, Jun Cheng, Zhifeng Zheng, Xiaoqing Huang, Lingzheng Bu, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406000991

                The lack of high-efficiency platinum (Pt)-based nanomaterials remains a formidable and exigent challenge in achieving high formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) catalysis for direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) technology. Herein, we report 16 Pt-based heterophase nanotrepang with rare earth (RE)-doped face-centered cubic Pt (fcc-Pt) and trigonal Pt-tellurium (t-PtTe2) configurations ((RE-Pt)-PtTe2 HPNT). Yttrium (Y) is identified as the optimal dopant, existing as single sites and clusters on the surface. The (Y-Pt)-PtTe2 HPNT/C demonstrates the superior mass and specific activities of 6.4 A mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.4 mA cm-2, outperforming commercial Pt/C by factors of 49.2 and 25.7, respectively. Additionally, it achieves a normalized MEA power density of 485.9 W gPt&#8722;1, tripling that of Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that Y doping enhances HCOO* intermediate adsorption and suppresses CO intermediate formation, thereby promoting FAOR kinetics. This work highlights the role of RE metals in heterostructure regulation of Pt-based anodic nanomaterials for achieving the efficient direct formic acid electrocatalysis. Developing advanced Pt-based anodic catalysts is vital for direct formic acid fuel cell technology. Here, the authors present a synergistic amalgamation strategy to design diverse heterostructures, introducing a class of Pt-based catalysts with promising potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Reversal in the Catalytic Capability of Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: An Explicit First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c18684</link>
      <description>Jing Xu, Wanlin Guo, Yufeng Guo, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406018970

                Pristine transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers are generally regarded as exhibiting low chemical reactivity due to their inert surfaces. Our extensive first-principles calculations, which incorporate an explicit solvation model, reveal that the catalytic performance of pristine TMD MX2 (where M = Mo or W, and X = S, Se or Te) monolayers for hydrogen evolution reaction can be significantly altered and enhanced through mechanically bending deformation. For a WTe2 monolayer, its hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy decreases to 0.004 eV under a bending curvature of 0.15 &#197;&#8211;1. The notable reversal in the catalytic capability of curved TMD monolayers can be primarily ascribed to the interplay between elastic energy stimuli and hydrogen adsorption energy barrier, alongside charge transfer to metal atoms facilitated by the weakening of M-X bonds and the exposure of metal atoms. A theoretical model has been established to elucidate the relationship among hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy, bending elastic energy, and adsorption energy barrier.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Flexibility of H-ZSM-5 Zeolite Upon Adsorption of Coke Precursors: A Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c07349</link>
      <description>Agnieszka Seremak, Izar Capel Berdiell, Bj&#248;rnar Arstad, Torstein Fjermestad, Stian Svelle, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406020765

                The flexibility of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite upon adsorption of selected coke precursors was investigated using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Four structural models with varying active site locations were analyzed through density functional theory (DFT) simulations to determine their responses to different types and quantities of aromatic molecules. Complementary experimental analysis was performed, allowing for a direct comparison with the theoretical findings, using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nitrogen adsorption (N2 adsorption), solid-state NMR, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). By employing proposed flexibility descriptors, significant structural changes in the MFI-type zeolite framework were identified, particularly in the unit cell parameters and the morphology of the straight channels. These changes were driven by electrostatic repulsion between adsorbates and by electrostatic attraction between adsorbates and the zeolite framework. The observed structural changes depended on both the active site location and the size and number of coke precursors. Consistent trends in structural flexibility were observed in both experimental and theoretical studies, primarily driven by variations in organic species loading. Our findings show the critical importance of active site location in influencing the magnitude of framework flexibility, which, in turn, affects the stabilization and accommodation of different coke precursors within the zeolite structure.</description>

      <title>Highly Active and Stable Al-Doped NiFe Self-Supported Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrode for Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04393</link>

                Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), a predominant technology for large-scale industrial hydrogen production, faces limitations in commercialization owing to the inadequate catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. This study introduces a NiFeAl self-supported electrode characterized by high activity and stability for the OER and outlines a rational design strategy for NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based self-supported electrodes. The introduction of Al, a ternary dopant with relatively low electronegativity and a small ionic radius, into the NiFe electrode effectively controls the adsorption energy of O-intermediates and facilitates the deprotonation of adsorbed OH*, thereby accelerating the OER. Remarkably, the NiFeAl self-supported electrode demonstrates approximately 50% enhanced operational activity (0.71 A cm&#8211;2 at 1.8 V) compared to NiFe alongside exceptional stability (&gt;72 h at 0.6 A cm&#8211;2) in OER within an AWE single cell. These findings highlight the significant potential of the NiFeAl electrode for application in AWE for efficient, large-scale hydrogen production.</description>

                Fullerenes, with well-defined molecular structures and high scalability, hold promise as fundamental building blocks for creating a variety of carbon materials. The fabrication and transfer of large-area films with precisely controlled thicknesses and morphologies on desired surfaces are crucial for designing and developing fullerene-based materials and devices. In this work, we present strategies for solid-state transferring C60 molecular nanometer-thin films, with dimensions of centimeters in lateral size and thicknesses controlled in the range of 1&#8211;20 nm, onto various substrates. Furthermore, we have successfully fabricated centimeter-wide graphene/C60/graphene heterostructures through layer-by-layer stacking of C60 and graphene films. This transfer methodology is versatile, allowing for the complete transfer of chemically modified C60 films, including oxygenated C60 films and C60Pdn organometallic polymer films. Additionally, direct solid-state transfer of C60 and C60Pdn films onto electrode surfaces has enabled their electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction to be probed directly. This thin-film transfer strategy allows precise manipulation of large-area, ultrathin C60 films on various substrates, providing a platform for fullerene chemistry and the experimental synthesis of artificial carbon structures.</description>

                Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) are a promising class of functional materials for fundamental physics explorations and applications in next-generation electronics, catalysis, quantum technologies, and energy-related fields. Theory and simulations have played a pivotal role in recent advancements, from understanding physical properties and discovering new materials to elucidating synthesis processes and designing novel devices. The key has been developments in ab initio theory, deep learning, molecular dynamics, high-throughput computations, and multiscale methods. This review focuses on how theory and simulations have contributed to recent progress in 2D TMDs research, particularly in understanding properties of twisted moir&#233;-based TMDs, predicting exotic quantum phases in TMD monolayers and heterostructures, understanding nucleation and growth processes in TMD synthesis, and comprehending electron transport and characteristics of different contacts in potential devices based on TMD heterostructures. The notable achievements provided by theory and simulations are highlighted, along with the challenges that need to be addressed. Although 2D TMDs have demonstrated potential and prototype devices have been created, we conclude by highlighting research areas that demand the most attention and how theory and simulation might address them and aid in attaining the true potential of 2D TMDs toward commercial device realizations.</description>

                High deuteration yields are difficult to attain with conventional chemical synthesis methods. In this work, we demonstrate that deuterated chemicals can be produced using electrochemical CO2 reduction in the presence of D2O. The absence of H2O enables deuteration yields over 99% for products such as ethanol-d6 and formate-d. With a D2O solvent, the competing D2 evolution reaction is completely suppressed at low current densities while being kept &lt;10% at a higher 300 mA/cm2.</description>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key process in sustainable energy conversion, utilizing a perovskite catalyst to achieve higher currents at lower overpotentials along with the production of value-added product hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), serves the dual functionality of both energy production and a green route for H2O2 generation. Here, we report the synthesis of a highly efficient double perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO), achieved through the incorporation of two transition metals, Ni and Mn, in the perovskite structure, and explore its activity for ORR. During ORR at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm in 1.0 M NaOH, LNMO exhibits an onset potential of 0.75 V (corresponding to a current density of 0.1 mA cm&#8211;2) and a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec&#8211;1, achieving over 88% H2O2 selectivity and 73% faradaic efficiency across a wide potential range of 0.2&#8211;0.6 V vs RHE. Characterization techniques including OCP, EIS, ICP-OES, XRD, XPS, FE-SEM, and FTIR confirmed the successful preparation of LNMO and its catalytic activity. The kinetic investigation unveiled by the transfer coefficient (&#945;) demonstrated that ORR on the LNMO surface followed a stepwise mechanism, involving an overall two irreversible electron transfer steps, where the first electron transfer was the rate-determining step. The analyses further revealed a diffusion-limited process for ORR accompanied by first-order kinetics with a standard rate constant (k0) of 3.97 &#215; 10&#8211;3 cm s&#8211;1 and a formal potential (E0) value of 0.96 V vs RHE. Finally, a stability test via chronoamperometry showed that LNMO outperformed the Pt/C catalyst.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Machine Learning/Molecular Mechanics End-State Corrections with Mechanical Embedding to Calculate Relative Protein&#8211;Ligand Binding Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01427</link>
      <description>Johannes Karwounopoulos, M. Bieniek, Zhiyi Wu, Adam L. Baskerville, Gerhard K&#246;nig, Benjamin P. Cossins, Geoffrey P. F. Wood, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406033300

                The development of machine-learning (ML) potentials offers significant accuracy improvements compared to molecular mechanics (MM) because of the inclusion of quantum-mechanical effects in molecular interactions. However, ML simulations are several times more computationally demanding than MM simulations, so there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. One possible compromise are hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) approaches with mechanical embedding that treat the intramolecular interactions of the ligand at the ML level and the protein&#8211;ligand interactions at the MM level. Recent studies have reported improved protein&#8211;ligand binding free energy results based on ML/MM using ANI-2x with mechanical embedding, arguing that intramolecular interactions like torsion potentials of the ligand are often the limiting factor for accuracy. This claim is evaluated based on 108 relative binding free energy calculations for four different benchmark systems. As an alternative strategy, we also tested a tool that fits the MM dihedral potentials to the ML level of theory. Fitting was performed with the ML potentials ANI-2x and AIMNet2, and, for the benchmark system TYK2, also with quantum-mechanical calculations using &#969;B97M-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVPPD. Overall, the relative binding free energy results from MM with Open Force Field 2.2.0, MM with ML-fitted torsion potentials, and the corresponding ML/MM end-state corrected simulations show no statistically significant differences in the mean absolute errors (between 0.8 and 0.9 kcal mol&#8211;1). This can probably be explained by the usage of the same MM parameters to calculate the protein&#8211;ligand interactions. Therefore, a well-parametrized force field is on a par with simple mechanical embedding ML/MM simulations for protein&#8211;ligand binding. In terms of computational costs, the reparametrization of poor torsional potentials is preferable over employing computationally intensive ML/MM simulations of protein&#8211;ligand complexes with mechanical embedding. Also, the refitting strategy leads to lower variances of the protein&#8211;ligand binding free energy results than the ML/MM end-state corrections. For free energy corrections with ML/MM, the results indicate that better convergence and more advanced ML/MM schemes will be required for applications in computer-guided drug discovery.</description>

                Abstract Atomically dispersed materials have been a thriving research field due to their maximum atomic utilization and remarkable performance in energy conversion and storage systems. Owing to the large atomic radius, strong oxophilicity, and unique electronic properties, rare&#8208;earth (RE) elements have been widely investigated as oxide carriers and promoters in atomically dispersed materials to manipulate and regulate the electronic structure of active species. Single&#8208;atom state with an adjustable coordination environment on the N&#8208;doped carbon endows RE metals with special electronic states and outstanding catalytic performances. A thorough comprehension of the electronic modulation mechanism of RE elements paves the way for the construction of advanced RE&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity. This review provides a widespread insight into the roles of RE elements in modulating the electronic properties of atomically dispersed materials combined with the structure&#8211;performance relationship in electrocatalysis processes. The characteristic physical and chemical properties of RE elements are highlighted, and the synthetic strategy of RE&#8208;based atomically dispersed materials is discussed. Finally, a summary and perspectives for rational design and development of highly efficient RE&#8208;based catalysts are proposed. This review aims to provide a guideline for promoting the rational and effective utilization of RE elements in advanced functional materials.</description>

                Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a widely used technique in surface-science laboratories. Yet, it is rarely used to its full potential. The quantitative information about the surface structure, contained in the modulation of the intensities of the diffracted beams as a function of incident electron energy, LEED I(V), is underutilized. To acquire these data, only minor adjustments would be required in most experimental setups, but existing analysis software is cumbersome to use and often computationally inefficient. The ViPErLEED (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED) project lowers these barriers, introducing a combined solution for user-friendly data acquisition, extraction, and computational analysis. These parts are discussed in three separate publications. Here, the focus is on the computational part of ViPErLEED, which performs highly automated LEED-I(V) calculations and structural optimizations. Minimal user input is required, and the functionality is significantly enhanced compared to existing solutions. Computation is performed by embedding the existing Erlangen tensor-LEED package (). ViPErLEED manages additional parallelization, monitors convergence, and processes all input and output. This makes LEED I(V) more accessible to new users while minimizing the potential for errors and the manual labor. Added functionalities include intelligent structure-dependent defaults for most calculation parameters, automatic detection of bulk and surface symmetries and their relationship, automated search procedures that preserve the symmetry and speed up convergence, adjustments to the code to handle larger systems than before, as well as parallelization and optimization. Modern file formats are used as input and output, and there is a direct interface to the atomic simulation environment (ASE) package. The software is implemented primarily in (version &#8805;3.7) and provided as an open-source package (GNU GPLv3 or any later version). A structure determination of the &#945;-Fe2O3(11&#175;02)&#8722;(1&#215;1) surface is presented as an example for the application of the software.

                A simulation can stand its ground against an experiment only if its prediction uncertainty is known. The unknown accuracy of interatomic potentials (IPs) is a major source of prediction uncertainty, severely limiting the use of large-scale classical atomistic simulations in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Here we explore covariance between predictions of metal plasticity, from 178 large-scale (~108 atoms) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and a variety of indicator properties computed at small-scales (&#8804;102 atoms). All simulations use the same 178 IPs. In a manner similar to statistical studies in public health, we analyze correlations of strength with indicators, identify the best predictor properties, and build a cross-scale "strength-on-predictors" regression model. This model is then used to estimate regression error over the statistical pool of IPs. Small-scale predictors found to be highly covariant with strength are computed using expensive quantum-accurate calculations and used to predict flow strength, within the statistical error bounds established in our study.</description>

      <title>CatFlow: An Automated Workflow for Training Machine Learning Potentials to Compute Free Energies in Dynamic Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c05568</link>
      <description>Yun&#8208;Pei Liu, Qiyuan Fan, Fu&#8208;Qiang Gong, Jun Cheng, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405920772

                Dynamic effects of catalysts play a crucial role in catalytic reactions, necessitating the incorporation of statistical sampling and understanding of the impact of dynamic structures in free energy calculations. However, the complexity of catalytic systems poses challenges in effectively exploring the vast configurational space effectively. In this work, we propose CatFlow, an automated workflow for training machine learning potentials (MLPs) to compute free energies of catalytic reactions. CatFlow combines constrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with concurrent training of MLPs and sequential calculation of free energies with well trained MLPs. By rapidly generating reliable MLPs, CatFlow facilitates rigorous free energy calculations, enabling the determination of the reaction profiles in an end-to-end manner. We showcased the capabilities of CatFlow by investigating the activation of O2 catalyzed by Pt clusters and demonstrated the effects of phase transition on the activities of the catalytic reaction. CatFlow offers an efficient and automated solution for studying the catalytic elementary reaction processes. It reduces the need for human intervention and provides researchers with a powerful tool to investigate free energies of dynamic catalysis.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into the Efficient Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia on Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c18690</link>
      <description>Fangting Xie, Xu Cai, Yi Li, Yongfan Zhang, Wei Lin, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405938599

                The nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has emerged as a promising approach for wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Poly(triazine imide)/LiCl (PTI/LiCl), a highly crystalline carbon nitride with a well-defined structure, has shown significant potential in this field. In this study, the electronic properties and catalytic performance of PTI/LiCl for NO3RR were investigated through theoretical calculations. Band structure and projected density of states (PDOS) analyses show that the intercalation of Li+ and Cl&#8211; ions within the PTI pores enhances electronic conductivity and improves its electronic properties. The reduction of nitrate to NH3 through a series of intermediates on the PTI/LiCl (001) surface shows exothermic free energy changes for each elementary step. The catalyst demonstrates outstanding selectivity and stability, effectively suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and byproduct formation. Charge density difference and PDOS analyses confirm the orbital interactions between absorbed NO3 and Li ions. The study highlights the potential of PTI/LiCl as a low-cost, efficient electrocatalyst for NO3RR and provides theoretical and practical insights for the design of environmentally friendly catalysts.</description>

      <title>Functional Nanocarbon Hybrids in Metal Oxide Nanocomposites for Photocatalysis</title>

                The textile industry is a major contributor to environmental pollution, primarily through the discharge of wastewater loaded with dyes and contaminants that disrupt natural ecosystems. This study aims to develop a hybrid material by functionalizing carbon nanodots (CNDs) with the donor-&#960;-acceptor organic dye L1 via amide coupling. By chemically modifying the surface of CNDs, we can enhance their multifunctionality and tailor their molecular composition. This innovative approach seeks to replace expensive dyes with cost-effective CNDs synthesized from citric acid and ethylenediamine using a domestic microwave oven, potentially improving the stability of the resulting hybrid. Additionally, TiO2 anatase particles were synthesized as a metal oxide platform and sensitized with both pristine materials and the CND-L1 hybrid. A range of physicochemical methods was employed to analyze the elemental, structural, and optical properties of these materials. In photocatalytic degradation tests of methyl orange, the sensitized catalysts demonstrated significantly improved efficiency compared to TiO2 alone. While CNDs exhibited good stability and enhanced L1&#8217;s stability, scavenger experiments revealed that holes and hydroxyl radicals play crucial roles in the degradation mechanism. This research underscores the promise of CND hybrids in advancing pollutant degradation technologies while reducing reliance on costly photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Toward a Generalizable Machine-Learned Potential for Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c12369</link>
      <description>Yifei Yue, Saad Aldin Mohamed, N. Duane Loh, Jianwen Jiang, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405947406

                Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have transformed the field of molecular simulations by scaling "quantum-accurate" potentials to linear time complexity. While they provide more accurate reproduction of physical properties as compared to empirical force fields, it is still computationally costly to generate their training data sets from ab initio calculations. Despite the emergence of foundational or general MLPs for organic molecules and dense materials, it is unexplored if one general MLP can be effectively developed for a wide variety of nanoporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different chemical moieties and geometric properties. Herein, by leveraging upon data-efficient equivariant MLPs, we demonstrate the possibility of developing a general MLP for nearly 3000 Zn-based MOFs. After curating a training data set comprising augmented MOF structures generated from density functional theory optimization, we validate the reliability of the general MLP in predicting accurate forces and energies when evaluated on a test set with chemically distinct MOF structures. Despite incurring slightly higher errors on structures containing rare chemical moieties, the general MLP can reliably reproduce physical (e.g., vibrational, thermodynamic, and mechanical) properties for a large sample of Zn-based MOFs. Crucially, by developing one MLP for many MOFs, the computational cost of high-throughput screening is potentially reduced by a few orders of magnitude. This enables us to predict quantum-accurate properties for notable Zn-MOFs that were previously uninvestigated via expensive theoretical calculations. To facilitate computational discovery among other families of complex chemical structures, we provide our data set and codes in the public Zenodo repository.</description>

      <title>Molten Salt&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Porous Precious Metal&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract Precious metal&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (PM&#8208;SACs) hosted in N&#8208;doped carbon supports have shown new opportunities to revolutionize cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, stabilizing the high density of PM&#8208;N x sites remains a challenge, primarily due to the inherently high free energy of isolated metal atoms, predisposing them to facile atomic agglomeration. Herein, a molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy is proposed to prepare porous PM 1 /N&#8208;C Pores (PM = Ru, Pt, and Pd) electrocatalysts with densely accessible PM&#8208;N x sites. A hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon substrate (N&#8208;C Pores ), synthesized via the NaCl&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8, effectively improves the utilization of PM&#8208;N x sites by increased reactants accessible surface area and reduced mass transfer resistance. In accordance with theoretical calculations, the as&#8208;prepared Ru 1 /N&#8208;C Pores , featuring superior intrinsic active Ru&#8208;N 4 sites, exhibit outstanding ORR turnover frequency of 6.19 e &#8722; site &#8722;1 s &#8722;1 , and outperforms the commercial Pt/C with a 5.3&#8208;fold of mass activity (5.83 &#177; 0.61 A mg &#8722;1 ) at 0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The commendable activity and stability of Ru 1 /N&#8208;C Pores in a real fuel cell device further affirm its practical applicability.</description>

                Designing efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under demanding acidic environments plays a critical role in advancing proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts with atomically dispersed metals have gained attention for their affordability, excellent catalytic performance, and distinctive features including consistent active sites and high atomic utilization. Over the past decade, significant achievements have been made in this field. This review offers a comprehensive summary of the latest developments in atomically dispersed M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts for ORR in acidic environments along with their applications in PEMFCs. The ORR mechanisms, PEMFC configuration, and operational principles are presented first, followed by an in-depth discussion of strategies to improve the activity and stability of the PEMFC using atomically dispersed M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts at the cathode. Lastly, this review highlights the unresolved challenges and proposes future research pathways for advancing high-performance atomically dispersed M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts and PEMFCs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling for Machine Learning Electron Density and Its Response in Real Space</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01355</link>
      <description>Chaoqiang Feng, Yaolong Zhang, Bin Jiang, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406051705

                Electron density is a fundamental quantity that can in principle determine all ground state electronic properties of a given system. Although machine learning (ML) models for electron density based on either an atom-centered basis or a real-space grid have been proposed, the demand for a number of high-order basis functions or grid points is enormous. In this work, we propose an efficient grid-point sampling strategy that combines targeted sampling favoring a large density and a screening of grid points associated with linearly independent atomic features. This new sampling strategy is integrated with a field-induced recursively embedded atom neural network model to develop a real-space grid-based ML model for the electron density and its response to an electric field. This approach is applied to a QM9 molecular data set, a H2O/Pt(111) interfacial system, an Au(100) electrode, and an Au nanoparticle under an electric field. The number of training points is found to be much smaller than previous models, while yielding comparably accurate predictions for the electron density of the entire grid. The resultant machine-learned electron density model enables us to properly partition partial charge onto each atom and analyze the charge variation upon proton transfer in the H2O/Pt(111) system. The machine-learning electronic response model allows us to predict charge transfer and the electrostatic potential change induced by an electric field applied to an Au(100) electrode or an Au nanoparticle.</description>
