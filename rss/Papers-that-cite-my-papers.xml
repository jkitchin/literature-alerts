                Since photocatalytic and electrocatalytic technologies are crucial for tackling the energy and environmental challenges, significant efforts have been put into exploring advanced catalysts. Among them, perovskite type ABO3 oxides show great promising catalytic activities because of their flexible physical and chemical properties. In this review, the fundamentals and recent progress in the synthesis of perovskite type ABO3 oxides are considered. We describe the mechanisms for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions (OER), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR), carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR), and metal-air batteries in details. Furthermore, the photocatalytic water splitting, CO2 conversion, pollutant degradation, and nitrogen fixation are reviewed as well. We also stress the applications of perovskite type ABO3 oxides in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFs). Finally, the optimization of perovskite type ABO3 oxides for applications in various fields and an outlook on the current and future challenges are depicted. The aim of this review is to present a broad overview of the recent advancements in the development of perovskite type ABO3 oxides-based catalysts and their applications in energy conversion and environmental remediation, as well as to present a roadmap for future development in these hot research areas.</description>

      <title>Polyimide Modified with Different Types and Contents of Polar/Nonpolar Groups: Synthesis, Structure, and Dielectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/polym17060753</link>
      <description>Ting Li, Jie Liu, Shuhui Yu, Xiaojun Zhang, Zhiqiang Chen, Polymers. 17(6)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408387819

                Polyimide-based dielectric materials, as excellent high-temperature-resistant polymers, play a crucial role in advanced electronic devices and power systems. However, given the limitations of composite PI materials, it is a significant challenge to simultaneously improve the dielectric constant and breakdown strength of intrinsic polyimide dielectric materials to achieve high energy density. In this study, an indiscriminate copolymerization method was proposed, which utilizes two different diamine monomers with bulky side groups (-CF3) and high polarity (C-O-C), respectively, to copolymerize with the same dianhydride monomer and prepare a series of intrinsic PI films. Remarkably, PI films with a highly dipolar rigid backbone maintain excellent thermal and mechanical properties while enhancing dipole polarization. Meanwhile, a high breakdown strength of PI is shown, because the bulky side groups act as deep traps to capture and disperse charges during the charge transfer process. Under the optimal copolymer ratio, the dielectric constant and dielectric loss are 4.2 and 0.008, respectively. At room temperature, the highest breakdown strength reaches 493MV/m, and the energy storage density and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency are 5.07 J/cm3 and 82%, respectively. Finally, based on density functional theory calculations, the copolymerization tendencies of the three monomers are verified, and it is speculated that the copolymerization ratio of PI-60% is the most stable and exhibits the best overall performance, which perfectly aligns with the experimental results. These experimental results demonstrate the exciting potential of intrinsic polyimide in thin film capacitors.</description>

                Anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) holds immense promise for hydrogen (H 2 ) production yet faces challenges due to the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Highly efficient and durable catalysts for HER are crucial for the successful implementation of AEMWE to produce hydrogen gas reliably. Ruthenium phosphides (Ru x P) have emerged as promising non&#8208;Pt catalysts for alkaline HER; however, they suffer from rapid degradation due to weak Ru&#63743;P bonding, which cannot protect the Ru center from further oxidation and subsequent dissolution. Herein, first&#8208;principles calculations indicate the enhanced stability of Ru&#63743;Se against oxidation compared to Ru&#63743;P, highlighting the importance of introducing Se into the Ru 2 P phase. Electrochemical studies using the selenium (Se)&#8208;doped Ru 2 P double&#8208;walled nanotubes (Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs) demonstrate significantly lower overpotentials (29 mV @ 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and robust stability (&gt;50 h) in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing those of Pt/C. In AEMWE, Ru 2 (P 0.9 Se 0.1 ) DWNTs exhibit an outstanding performance (10.31 A cm &#8722;2 @ 80 &#176;C, stable @ 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 for &#8776;200 h), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The findings of this study highlight the pivotal role of anion modification in enhancing the catalytic stability and performance for efficient hydrogen production in AEMWE systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning Transition Metal 3d Spin state on Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202417034</link>
      <description>Yipeng Zang, Yan Liu, Ruihu Lu, Qin Yang, B.X. Wang, Mingsheng Zhang, Yu Mao, Ziyun Wang, Yanwei Lum, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408416065

                Abstract Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state ( d x2&#8208; y2 0 , d z2 0 , d xz 2 , d yz 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe&#8208;N 4 to high spin state ( d x2&#8208;y2 0 , d xz 1 , d yz 1 , d z2 1 , d xy 2 ) in Fe&#8208;N 3 &#8208;P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO 2 R, the SAC with Fe&#8208;N 3 &#8208;P active sites yields &gt; 90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of &#8776;530 mV and a maximum CO partial current density of &#8776;600 mA cm &#8722;2 . Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe 3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the d xz / d yz &#8208;&#960;* bond, which enhances * COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO 2 R performance.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Plasma Activated Ultradurable Molybdenum Oxycarbide Electrocatalysts for Acidic Hydrogen Evolution up to 10 A cm-2</title>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution in acidic media at industrial-level current densities is limited by high overpotential, performance degradation, and thus low throughput. To address these issues, we developed a novel nanoedge-enriched molybdenum oxycarbide (MoOxCy) electrocatalysts with a uniform phase by non-equilibrium plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The vertically standing MoOxCy exhibits low overpotential of 415 mV and outstanding long-term operational stability (~ 0.11% performance degradation over 1,000 h) at high current densities up to 10 A cm&#8722; 2, corresponding to an ultrahigh hydrogen throughput of 4,477.4 L cm&#8722; 2 and a lifetime throughput of 407,033 L cm&#8722; 2 which exceed the department of energy (DOE) targets of 1,253.7 L cm&#8722; 2 and 100,503 L cm&#8722; 2, respectively. Molybdenum oxycarbide catalysts outperform state-of-the-art transition metal- and even noble metal-based catalysts (throughput of 9 ~ 269 L cm&#8722; 2 and lifetime throughput of 8 ~ 269 L cm&#8722; 2) by more than an order of magnitude for throughput and three orders of magnitude for lifetime throughput. The key mechanisms enabling high catalytic performance and stability are achieved by incorporating carbon into MoO2 lattices, which reduces the valence state of Mo, leading to weakened binding energy of Mo-H and thus improved hydrogen evolution performance. Density functional theory results suggest that the presence of carbon atoms in MoOxCy increases the binding energy between Mo and the adjacent atoms, improving the stability of MoOxCy operating under harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the development of new transition metal-based catalysts for practical industrial electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.</description>

      <title>Constructing N- and F-Dual-Doped Pt-Based Heterojunction Catalysts via Synergistic Electronic Modulation for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Activity and CO Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c03350</link>

                The development of efficient and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable energy conversion. Although platinum (Pt) serves as a benchmark HER catalyst, its practical application is hindered by the high cost, limited durability, and susceptibility to CO poisoning. In this work, we report a heterojunction Pt-based catalyst, Pt@NCL-MXene, synthesized by LiF etching of MXene and subsequent NH3 calcination. This process introduces dual nitrogen (N) and fluorine (F) doping and yields a nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NCL) coating on Pt nanoparticles with an average size of only 3.4 nm. Compared with conventional Pt&#8211;C catalysts, Pt@NCL-MXene exhibits a larger specific surface area, enhanced electron transfer efficiency, and an optimized d-band center, thereby facilitating both H* adsorption and desorption. As a result, Pt@NCL-MXene achieves a significantly lower overpotential of 73 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2, alongside improved kinetics and stability under operational conditions. Furthermore, the 9 wt % F-rich MXene support effectively suppresses CO adsorption on Pt, reducing the CO uptake to 0.224 mmol g&#8211;1, which is purportedly lower than that of Pt&#8211;C (0.264 mmol g&#8211;1), thereby mitigating CO poisoning and prolonging the catalyst's service life. These findings offer insights into the rational design of advanced CO-resistant Pt-based HER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Direct Electrosynthesis of an Amino Acid from a Biomass Derivative</title>

                The electrochemical synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules from biomass-derived compounds under ambient conditions is demonstrated, relying only on green sources of feedstock, renewable energy, and water. In this study, we report a two-step method of electrochemically synthesizing 5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-carboxylic acid (AFCA) from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) using hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as the nitrogen source in an acidic electrolyte. In the first step, HMF was reductively aminated into (5-(aminomethyl)furan-2-yl)methanol (HMFA) using NH2OH as the source of nitrogen. This was followed by a second step, involving the oxidation of HMFA to AFCA on a manganese oxide (MnOx) anode at the same pH. MnOx was able to selectively oxidize the alcohol group on HMFA to produce AFCA with 35% Faradaic efficiency without affecting the amine group. As both of these reactions are completed in a pH 1 electrolyte, it eliminates the need to separate HMFA before proceeding with the second reaction. Among different metal electrodes (Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Pt and Sn) tested for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction, Ag electrodes displayed the best performance to selectively aminate HMF to the intermediate species, HMFA, with up to 69% Faradaic efficiency at mild potentials of &#8722;0.50 VRHE. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to explore a possible reaction pathway for the reductive amination on Ag(111), which suggests a thermodynamically feasible reaction even at 0 VRHE. The cathodic experimental reaction parameters were optimized to reveal that an electrolyte pH of 1 is optimal for the electrochemical reductive amination reaction. Our work shapes the future possibility of an electrochemical synthesis to produce AFCA without the need for any product separation between steps by combining the Ag cathode reaction to the MnOx anode reaction sharing the same electrolyte. Since both the cathode and anode reactions both involve four electrons transferred, combining both half reactions in a single electrochemical reactor can eliminate the need for energy-wasting auxiliary counter reactions such as hydrogen evolution or water oxidation.</description>

                Understanding active phases across interfaces, interphases, and even within the bulk under varying external conditions and environmental species is critical for advancing heterogeneous catalysis. Describing these phases through computational models faces the challenges in the generation and calculation of a vast array of atomic configurations. Here, we present a framework for the automatic and efficient exploration of active phases. This approach utilizes a topology-based algorithm leveraging persistent homology to systematically sample configurations across diverse coordination environments and material morphologies. Simultaneously, efficient machine learning force fields enable rapid computations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in two systems: hydrogen absorption in Pd, where hydrogen penetrates subsurface layers and the bulk, inducing a "hex" reconstruction critical for CO2 electroreduction, explored through 50,000 sampled configurations; and the oxidation dynamics of Pt clusters, where oxygen incorporation renders the clusters less active during oxygen reduction reactions, investigated through 100,000 sampled configurations. In both cases, the predicted active phases and their impacts on catalytic mechanisms closely align with previous experimental observations, indicating that the proposed strategy can model complex catalytic systems and discovery active phases under specific environmental conditions. Discovering active phases in heterocatalysis entails efficient configuration sampling and optimization. Here, the authors developed a framework based on topology and machine learning to effectively explore the active structures, applied in the CO2 electroreduction and Oxygen Reduction Reaction</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Graph Neural Networks via Active Learning: Unlocking the Potential of Graph Neural Networks Trained on Nonaqueous Systems for Aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized catalysis research with their efficiency and accuracy in modeling complex chemical interactions. However, adapting GNNs trained on nonaqueous data sets to aqueous systems poses notable challenges due to intricate water interactions. In this study, we proposed an active learning-based fine-tuning approach to extend the applicability of GNNs to aqueous environments. The geometry optimization and transition state search workflows are designed to reduce computational costs while maintaining DFT-level accuracy. Applied to the CO2 reduction reaction, the workflow delivers a 2-3-fold acceleration in geometry optimization through a relaxed force threshold combined with DFT refinement. The versatility of the transition state search algorithm was demonstrated on key C-C coupling pathways, pinpointing *CO-*COH as the most energetically favorable pathway in aqueous systems of Cu and Cu-based Ag, Au, and Zn alloys. The Br&#248;nsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship remains robust under water-induced fluctuations, with alloyed metals such as Al, Ga, and Pd, along with Ag, Au, and Zn, exhibiting coupling efficiency comparable to that of Cu. Additionally, perturbation-based training on forces and energies extends the application of GNNs to aqueous ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, enabling efficient modeling of dynamical trajectories. This work presents novel approaches to adapting nonaqueous models for application in aqueous systems, highlighting GNNs' potential in solvated environments and laying a foundation for accelerating predictions of catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Site-specific synergy in heterogeneous single atoms for efficient oxygen evolution</title>

                Abstract Heterogeneous single-atom systems demonstrate potential to break performance limitations of single-atom catalysts through synergy interactions. The synergy in heterogeneous single atoms strongly dependes on their anchoring sites. Herein, we reveal the site-specific synergy in heterogeneous single atoms for oxygen evolution. The Ru T Ir V /CoOOH is fabricated by anchoring Ru single atoms onto three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites and Ir single atoms onto oxygen vacancy sites on CoOOH. Moreover, Ir T Ru V /CoOOH is also prepared by switching the anchoring sites of single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate the Ru T Ir V /CoOOH exhibits enhanced OER performance compared to Ir T Ru V /CoOOH. In-situ spectroscopic and mechanistic studies indicate that Ru single atoms at three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites serve as adsorption sites for key reaction intermediates, while Ir single atoms at oxygen vacancy sites stabilize the *OOH intermediates via hydrogen bonding interactions. This work discloses the correlation between the synergy in heterogeneous single atoms and their anchoring sites.</description>

                Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is not only an important fundamental process in energy systems but also a pivotal factor in enhancing electrocatalytic functions in fuel cells (FCs). This article investigates the PCET mechanism in low-temperature (300&#8211;500 &#176;C) protonic ceramic fuel cells, focusing on its role in catalyzing the hydrogen oxidation reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction. Our findings reveal that PCET significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity by mitigating polarization losses, reducing charge-transfer resistance by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, and thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics compared to scenarios without PCET. Importantly, changes in relaxation time upon proton injection evidence the robustness of PCET. The marked reduction in activation energy to 0.31 eV further illustrates how PCET overcomes energy barriers, facilitating more efficient reaction pathways. These insights highlight the critical role of PCET in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of FCs, underscoring its significant importance in advancing FC technology.</description>

                Surfaces and interfaces play key roles in chemical and material science. Understanding physical and chemical processes at complex surfaces and interfaces is a challenging task. Machine learning provides a powerful tool to help analyze and accelerate simulations. This comprehensive review affords an overview of the applications of machine learning in the study of surfaces and interfaces of chemical systems and materials. We categorize surfaces and interfaces into the following broad categories: solid&#8211;solid interface, solid&#8211;liquid interface, liquid&#8211;liquid interface, surface of solid, surface of liquid, and three-phase interfaces. High-throughput screening, combined machine learning and first-principles calculations, and machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are used to rational design and study physical and chemical processes of surfaces and interfaces in systems such as all-solid-state batteries, solar cells, and heterogeneous catalysis. This review provides detailed and comprehensive information on the applications of machine learning on surfaces and interfaces for chemical and material science.</description>

      <title>Influence of Coverage Dependence on the Thermophysical Properties of Adsorbates and Its Impact on Microkinetic Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02167</link>
      <description>Jongyoon Bae, Bjarne Kreitz, Andrew A. Peterson, C. Franklin Goldsmith, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408528041

                This work focuses on the impact of lateral interactions on the thermophysical properties of adsorbates. We present different parametrizations for coverage-dependent enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity in a mean-field microkinetic model. These models are tested against two systems, CO/Pt(111) and CO/Co(0001), using two different functionals. A detailed investigation into how coverage influences the thermophysical properties of CO* is presented. We place particular emphasis on studying the impact of coverage on the vibrational partition function and how this affects the entropy of adsorbates. Higher coverages typically lead to increased repulsive interactions, which should further constrain the large amplitude modes that contribute the most to the vibrational entropy. In some cases, however, the opposite effect occurred; the vibrational entropy actually increased because surface crowding forced adsorbates to different binding locations that had lower frequencies. Our results highlighted cases where coverage-dependent entropy should be included, such as for adsorbates with lateral vibrational modes and systems at high temperatures. These methods for including coverage-dependent properties into mean-field microkinetics in a thermodynamically consistent way are now available in the open-source software Cantera.</description>

                Abstract The commercial utilization of low&#8208;dimensional catalysts has been hindered by their propensity for agglomeration and stacking, greatly minimizing their utilization of active sites. To circumvent this problem, low&#8208;dimensional materials can be assembled into systematic 3D architectures to synergistically retain the benefits of their constituent low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, with value&#8208;added bulk properties such as increased active surface area, improved charge transport pathways, and enhanced mass transfer, leading to higher catalytic activity and durability compared to their constituents. The hierarchical organization of low&#8208;dimensional building blocks within 3D structures also enables precise control over the catalyst's morphology, composition, and surface chemistry, facilitating tailored design for specific electrochemical applications. Despite the surge in 3D metal&#8208;based assemblies, there are no reviews encompassing the different types of metal&#8208;based 3D assemblies from low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials for electrocatalysis. Herein, this review addresses this gap by investigating the various types of self&#8208;supported 3D assemblies and exploring how their electrocatalytic performance can be elevated through structural modifications and mechanistic studies to tailor them for various electrochemical reactions.</description>

                Abstract To enhance the lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, developing highly durable platinum&#8208;based cathode catalysts is essential. While two degradation pathways for the cathode catalyst&#8212;carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst (platinum nanoparticles) coarsening&#8212;have been identified, current approaches to enhance its durability are limited to addressing individual degradation pathways. Herein, the study develops a core/shell&#8208;structured carbon support that is designed to afford cathode catalysts capable of simultaneously inhibiting carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst coarsening. The core/shell structure is distinguished by its bifunctional nature: the core is made of highly graphitized carbon tailored to build a robust carbon skeleton, and the shell comprises heteroatom&#8208;doped amorphous carbon engineered to prevent electrocatalyst coarsening by chemical/physical anchoring of platinum nanoparticles. Thanks to this elaborate design, the catalyst surpasses the durability targets for carbon supports and electrocatalysts set by the U.S. Department of Energy, as supported by the achieved durability metrics after the square&#8208;wave/triangle&#8208;wave accelerated stress tests: electrochemical surface area loss at 13%/3%, mass activity loss at 27%/17%, and voltage loss of 29 mV (at 0.8 A cm &#8722; 2 )/4 mV (at 1.5 A cm &#8722; 2 ).</description>
