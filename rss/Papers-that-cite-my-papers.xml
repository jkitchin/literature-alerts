      <title>Experiment-Driven Atomistic Materials Modeling: A Case Study Combining X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Machine Learning Potentials to Infer the Structure of Oxygen-Rich Amorphous Carbon</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c01897</link>
      <description>Tigany Zarrouk, R. I. Ibragimova, Albert P. Bart&#243;k, A. Miguel, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396914550

                An important yet challenging aspect of atomistic materials modeling is reconciling experimental and computational results. Conventional approaches involve generating numerous configurations through molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo structure optimization and selecting the one with the closest match to experiment. However, this inefficient process is not guaranteed to succeed. We introduce a general method to combine atomistic machine learning (ML) with experimental observables that produces atomistic structures compatible with experiment by design. We use this approach in combination with grand-canonical Monte Carlo within a modified Hamiltonian formalism, to generate configurations that agree with experimental data and are chemically sound (low in energy). We apply our approach to understand the atomistic structure of oxygenated amorphous carbon (a-COx), an intriguing carbon-based material, to answer the question of how much oxygen can be added to carbon before it fully decomposes into CO and CO2. Utilizing an ML-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) model trained from GW and density functional theory (DFT) data, in conjunction with an ML interatomic potential, we identify a-COx structures compliant with experimental XPS predictions that are also energetically favorable with respect to DFT. Employing a network analysis, we accurately deconvolve the XPS spectrum into motif contributions, both revealing the inaccuracies inherent to experimental XPS interpretation and granting us atomistic insight into the structure of a-COx. This method generalizes to multiple experimental observables and allows for the elucidation of the atomistic structure of materials directly from experimental data, thereby enabling experiment-driven materials modeling with a degree of realism previously out of reach.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Single-Atom Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Based on BiTeBr Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102377</link>
      <description>Tao Yang, Qiquan Luo, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396920569

                Developing an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective measure to alleviate the energy crisis. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on Janus materials demonstrated promising prospects for the HER. Herein, density functional theory calculations were conducted to systematically investigate the performance of SACs based on the BiTeBr monolayer. Among the one hundred and forty models that were constructed, fourteen SACs with potential HER activity were selected. Significantly, the SAC, in which a single Ru atom is anchored on a BiTeBr monolayer with a Bi vacancy (RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr), exhibits excellent HER activity with an ultra-low |&#916;GH*| value. A further investigation revealed that RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr tends to react through the Volmer&#8211;Heyrovsky mechanism. An electronic structure analysis provided deeper insights into this phenomenon. This is because the Tafel pathway requires overcoming steric hindrance and disrupting stable electron filling states, making it challenging to proceed. This study finally employed constant potential calculations, which approximate experimental situations. The results indicated that the &#916;GH* value at pH = 0 is 0.056 eV for RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr, validating the rationality of the traditional Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) method for performance evaluation in this system. This work provides a reference for the research of new HER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Potential Model of Two-Dimensional Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Quantum Efficiency for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c00980</link>
      <description>Xiao Luo, Yunlei Wang, Haifeng Lv, Xiaojun Wu, &#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396921458

                Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled using building blocks have been widely employed in photocatalysis due to their customizable optoelectronic characteristics and porous structure, which facilitate charge carrier and mass movement. Nevertheless, the development of COF photocatalysts encounters a continuous obstacle in enhancing the efficiency of photocatalysis, impeded by a limited comprehension of the orbital interaction between molecular fragments and linkers. In this study, we present a model that examines the interaction between molecular fragments in an imine-based COF at the frontier molecular orbital level, enabling us to comprehend the impact of manipulating linkers on light adsorption, exciton efficiency, and catalytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that altering the connecting orientation of 14 R&#8211;C=N&#8211;R imine linkers in 2D COFs can enhance solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency under visible light from 2.76% to 4.24%. This research has the potential to provide a valuable model for refining photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Effects of graphene doping and gas adsorption on the peak positions of graphene plasmon resonance and adsorbate infrared absorption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1116/6.0003588</link>
      <description>Jongpil Ye, Journal of vacuum science and technology. B, Nanotechnology &amp; microelectronics. 42(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396924530

                The peak positions of graphene plasmon resonance can be controlled to overlap with those of the infrared absorption spectra of gas molecules, allowing highly sensitive detection and identification by graphene nanoribbons. In this study, we investigate the adsorption of gas molecules, including SO2, SO3, H2S, and NH3, on graphene and characterize its effects on the relative positions of the two peaks using density functional theory and the finite difference time domain method. It is demonstrated that the binding energies are stronger, and the amounts of charge transfer are greater in the case of SO2 and SO3 adsorbed on n-doped graphene than in other cases. Electron acceptance by SO2 and SO3 adsorbates on n-doped graphene redshifts the graphene plasmon resonance peaks and their stretching and wagging infrared absorption peaks. However, the former is significantly further redshifted, leading to narrower peak-position-matching ribbon widths in n-doped graphene than in p-doped graphene. The amounts of charge transfer are relatively small regardless of the doping type in the case of NH3 and H2S, mitigating the doping-type dependence compared to SO2 and SO3. The wagging peaks of NH3 on n-doped graphene are shown to be further blueshifted than on p-doped graphene, rendering their peak-position-matching ribbon widths further closer to each other. These results suggest that the effects of doping and adsorption on the two types of peaks should be considered to optimize the performance of graphene plasmon-based gas sensing and identification.</description>

                The presented study is concerned with a new multi-step method to synthesize PtCo/C materials based on composite CoxOy/C that combines the advantages of different liquid-phase synthesis methods. Based on the results of studying the materials at each stage of synthesis with the TG, XRD, TEM, SEI, TXRF, CV and LSV methods, a detailed overview of the sequential changes in catalyst composition and structure at each stage of the synthesis is presented. The PtCo/C catalyst synthesized with the multi-step method is characterized by a uniform distribution of bimetallic nanoparticles of about 3 nm in size over the surface of the support, which result in its high ESA and ORR activity. The activity study for the synthesized PtCo/C catalyst in an MEA showed better current&#8211;voltage characteristics and a higher maximum specific power compared with an MEA based on a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the results of the presented study demonstrate high prospects for the developed approach to the multi-step synthesis of PtM/C catalysts, which may enhance the characteristics of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).</description>

      <title>Density Functional Study of Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction in Fourth-Period Transition Metal&#8211;Tetrahydroxyquinone Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102320</link>
      <description>Yufeng Wen, Xianshi Zeng, Yanan Xiao, Rong Wen, Kai Xiong, Zhangli Lai, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396928519

                This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal&#8211;organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract Nowadays, literature review is a necessary task when trying to solve a given problem. However, an exhaustive literature review is very time-consuming in today&#8217;s vast literature landscape. It can take weeks, even if looking only for abstracts or surveys. Moreover, choosing a method among others, and targeting searches within relevant problem and solution domains, are not easy tasks. These are especially true for young researchers or engineers starting to work in their field. Even if surveys that provide methods used to solve a specific problem already exist, an automatic way to do it for any use case is missing, especially for those who don&#8217;t know the existing literature. Our proposed tool, SARBOLD-LLM, allows discovering and choosing among methods related to a given problem, providing additional information about their uses in the literature to derive decision-making insights, in only a few hours. The SARBOLD-LLM comprises three modules: (1: Scopus search) paper selection using a keyword selection scheme to query Scopus API; (2: Scoring and method extraction) relevancy and popularity scores calculation and solution method extraction in papers utilizing OpenAI API (GPT 3.5); (3: Analyzes) sensitivity analysis and post-analyzes which reveals trends, relevant papers and methods. Comparing the SARBOLD-LLM to manual ground truth using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, the performance results of AI in the oncology case study are 0.68, 0.9, and 0.77, respectively. SARBOLD-LLM demonstrates successful outcomes across various domains, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness. The SARBOLD-LLM addresses engineers more than researchers, as it proposes methods and trends without adding pros and cons. It is a useful tool to select which methods to investigate first and comes as a complement to surveys. This can limit the global search and accumulation of knowledge for the end user. However, it can be used as a director or recommender for future implementation to solve a problem.</description>

                Water electrolysis, a key enabler of hydrogen energy production, presents significant potential as a strategy for achieving net-zero emissions. However, the widespread deployment of water electrolysis is currently limited by the high-cost and scarce noble metal electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given this challenge, design and synthesis of cost-effective and high-performance alternative catalysts have become a research focus, which necessitates insightful understandings of HER fundamentals and material engineering strategies. Distinct from typical reviews that concentrate only on the summary of recent catalyst materials, this review article shifts focus to material engineering strategies for developing efficient HER catalysts. In-depth analysis of key material design approaches for HER catalysts, such as doping, vacancy defect creation, phase engineering, and metal-support engineering, are illustrated along with typical research cases. A special emphasis is placed on designing noble metal-free catalysts with a brief discussion on recent advancements in electrocatalytic water-splitting technology. The article also delves into important descriptors, reliable evaluation parameters and characterization techniques, aiming to link the fundamental mechanisms of HER with its catalytic performance. In conclusion, it explores future trends in HER catalysts by integrating theoretical, experimental and industrial perspectives, while acknowledging the challenges that remain.</description>

                Abstract Design of active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the electrocatalyst properties and interfacial structural dynamics during OER. One of the essential insights for advanced electrocatalyst design is vivid understanding of the drivers and mechanisms of dissolution of electrocatalysts. In this work we analyze some important aspects of electrocatalyst dissolution during OER, to deepen and advance our understanding of activity&#8208;stability relations and relevant stability descriptors.</description>

                Abstract The low&#8208;energy electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has garnered significant attention as a viable alternative to traditional industrial routes, with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality. For their H 2 O 2 selectivity in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the coordination environment of tungsten (W)&#8208;based materials is critical. In this study, atomically dispersed W single atoms were immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon substrates by a facile pyrolysis method to obtain a W single&#8208;atom catalyst (W&#8208;SAC). The coordination environment of an isolated W single atom with a tetra&#8208;coordinated porphyrin&#8208;like structure in W&#8208;SAC was determined by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared W&#8208;SAC showed superior two&#8208;electron ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH solution, including high onset potential (0.89 V), high H 2 O 2 selectivity (82.5%), and excellent stability. By using differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that the charge symmetry&#8208;breaking of W atoms changes the adsorption behavior of the intermediates, leading to enhanced reactivity and selectivity for two&#8208;electron ORR. This work broadens the avenue for understanding the charge transfer of W&#8208;based electrocatalytic materials and the in&#8208;depth reaction mechanism of SACs in two&#8208;electron ORR.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Limited Experimental Data with Machine Learning: Differentiating a Methyl from an Ethyl Group in the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata Reduction</title>

                We present a case study on how to improve an existing metal-free catalyst for a particularly difficult reaction, namely, the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction of butanone, which constitutes the classic and prototypical challenge of being able to differentiate a methyl from an ethyl group. As there are no known strategies on how to address this challenge, we leveraged the power of machine learning by constructing a realistic (for a typical laboratory) small, albeit high-quality, data set of about 100 reactions (run in triplicate) that we used to train a model in combination with a key-intermediate graph (of substrate and catalyst) to predict the differences in Gibbs activation energies &#916;&#916;G&#8225; of the enantiomeric reaction paths. With the help of this model, we were able to select and subsequently screen a small selection of catalysts and increase the selectivity for the CBS reduction of butanone to 80% enantiomeric excess (ee), the highest possible value achieved to date for this substrate with a metal-free catalyst, thereby also exceeding the best available enzymatic systems (64% ee) and the selectivity with Corey's original catalyst (60% ee). This translates into a &gt;50% improvement in relative &#916;G&#8225; from 0.9 to 1.4 kcal mol&#8211;1. We underscore the transformative potential of machine learning in accelerating catalyst design because we rely on a manageable small data set and a key-intermediate graph representing a combination of catalyst and substrate graphs in lieu of a transition-state model. Our results highlight the synergy of synthetic chemistry and data-centric approaches and provide a blueprint for future catalyst optimization.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopy of Carboxylate-Passivated Semiconducting Nanocrystals: Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c01988</link>

                The surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands that exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. The binding geometries of these ligands are often experimentally investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of "tilted-bridge"-type geometries and does not indicate the coexistence of "bridging" and "chelating" binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates the limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing the IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>A reactive neural network framework for water-loaded acidic zeolites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48609-2</link>
      <description>Andreas Erlebach, Martin &#352;&#237;pka, Indranil Saha, Petr Nachtigall, Christopher J. Heard, Luk&#225;&#353; Grajciar, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396999021

                Abstract Under operating conditions, the dynamics of water and ions confined within protonic aluminosilicate zeolite micropores are responsible for many of their properties, including hydrothermal stability, acidity and catalytic activity. However, due to high computational cost, operando studies of acidic zeolites are currently rare and limited to specific cases and simplified models. In this work, we have developed a reactive neural network potential (NNP) attempting to cover the entire class of acidic zeolites, including the full range of experimentally relevant water concentrations and Si/Al ratios. This NNP has the potential to dramatically improve sampling, retaining the (meta)GGA DFT level accuracy, with the capacity for discovery of new chemistry, such as collective defect formation mechanisms at the zeolite surface. Furthermore, we exemplify how the NNP can be used as a basis for further extensions/improvements which include data-efficient adoption of higher-level (hybrid) references via &#916;-learning and the acceleration of rare event sampling via automatic construction of collective variables. These developments represent a significant step towards accurate simulations of realistic catalysts under operando conditions.</description>

                Abstract As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion requires electrocatalysts, which greatly motivates the exploitation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts based on nonprecious metals. Molybdenum&#8208;based nanomaterials have demonstrated promise as electrocatalysts because of their unique physiochemical and electronic properties. Among them, atomic Mo catalysts, also called Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (Mo&#8208;SACs), have the most accessible active sites and tunable microenvironments and are thrivingly explored in various electrochemical conversion reactions. A timely review of such rapidly developing topics is necessary to provide guidance for further exploration of optimized Mo&#8208;SACs toward electrochemical energy technologies. In this review, recent advances in the synthetic strategies for Mo&#8208;SACs are highlighted, focusing on the microenvironment engineering of Mo atoms. Then, the representative achievements of their applications in various electrocatalytic reactions involving the N 2 , H 2 O, and CO 2 cycles are summarized by combining experimental and computational results. Finally, prospects for the future development of Mo&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are provided and the key challenges that require further investigation and optimization are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Eggshell&#8208;Like Carbon Microspheres with Curvature Scheme: Distorted Energy Band and Atomic Charge Waves&#8208;Driven High Performance for Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402168</link>
      <description>Qiheng Wang, Ruixue Li, Wenquan Feng, Mengying Liu, Peng Li, Jingjun Liu, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397013926

                Abstract A metal&#8208;free nanocarbon with an eggshell structure is synthesized from chitosan (CS) and natural spherical graphite (NSG) as a cathode electrocatalyst for clean zinc&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. It is developed using CS&#8208;derived carbons as an eggshell, covering NSG cores. The synthesis involves the in situ growth of CS on NSG, followed by ammonia&#8208;assisted pyrolysis for carbonization. The resulting catalyst displays a curved structure and completely coated NSG, showing superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. In 1 M NaOH, the ORR half&#8208;wave potential reached 0.93 V, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst by 50 mV. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;air battery featuring the catalyst achieves a peak power density of 167 mW cm &#8208;2 with excellent stability, outperforming the Pt/C. The improved performance of the eggshell carbons can be attributed to the distorted energy band of the active sites in the form of N&#8208;C moieties. More importantly, the curved thin eggshells induce built&#8208;in electric fields that can promote electron redistribution to generate atomic charge waves around the N&#8208;C moieties on the carbon shells. As a result, the high positively charged and stable C + sites adjacent to N atoms optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen molecules, thereby facilitating performance.</description>

                Emerging as a new class of two&#8208;dimensional materials with atomically thin layers, MBenes have great potential for many important applications such as energy storage and electrocatalysis. Toward mitigating carbon footprint, there has been increasing interest in CO 2 /CO conversion on MBenes, but mostly focused on C 1 products. C 2+ chemicals generally possess higher energy densities and wider applications than C 1 counterparts. However, C&#8211;C coupling is technically challenging because of high energy requirement and currently few catalysts are suited for this process. Here, we explore electrochemical CO reduction reaction to C 2 chemicals on Mo 2 B 2 O 2 MBene via density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Remarkably, the most favorable CO&#8211;COH coupling is revealed to be a spontaneous and barrierless process, making Mo 2 B 2 O 2 an efficient catalyst for C&#8211;C coupling. Among C 1 and C 2 chemicals, ethanol is predicted to be the primary product. Furthermore, by charge and bond analysis, it is unraveled that there exist significantly more unbonded electrons in the C atom of intermediate *COH than other C 1 intermediates, which is responsible for the facile C&#8211;C coupling. From an atomic scale, this work provides microscopic insight into C&#8211;C coupling process and suggests Mo 2 B 2 O 2 a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO reduction to C 2 chemicals.</description>

                In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm2. The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm2 current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 &#176;C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol. The present catalysts also demonstrate stable performance at 300 mA/cm2 in 4 M KOH electrolyte at 50 &#176;C for more than 20 h. The synergy induced by Fe doping into NiO activates catalytic sites, expediting charge transfer and reaction kinetics. The present research report highlights the potential of catalysts as a practical and cost-effective approach for green hydrogen production via water splitting.</description>

                CO 2 capture and utilization has been attracting intensive attention owing to its vital importance in long-standing carbon emission reduction. Numerous novel catalysts and strategies for the integrated conversion of CO 2 have been developed in past decades. Here, we review our recent electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on CO 2 activation and catalytic transformation. The focus is mainly on the computational design of several types of low-dimensional, nanomaterial-supported, atomically dispersed metal and nonmetal catalysts for electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO 2 as well as metal macrocycles for the coupling of CO 2 with epoxides. Based on extensive calculations and simulations, detailed reaction mechanisms, performances of catalysts, and structure-activity relationships for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic transformation of CO 2 have been discussed.</description>

                Abstract Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs) have the advantages of using cost-effective materials, but hindered by the sluggish anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics. Here, we report an atomically dispersed Ir on Mo 2 C nanoparticles supported on carbon (Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C) as highly active and stable HOR catalysts. The specific exchange current density of Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C is 4.1 mA cm &#8722;2 ECSA , which is 10 times that of Ir/C. Negligible decay is observed after 30,000-cycle accelerated stability test. Theoretical calculations suggest the high HOR activity is attributed to the unique Mo 2 C substrate, which makes the Ir sites with optimized H binding and also provides enhanced OH binding sites. By using a low loading (0.05 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 ) of Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C as anode, the fabricated HEMFC can deliver a high peak power density of 1.64 W cm &#8722;2 . This work illustrates that atomically dispersed precious metal on carbides may be a promising strategy for high performance HEMFCs.</description>

                Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) have emerged as highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), providing a promising avenue to solve the carbon dilemma. Based on density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the capability of 12 tetra-atom transitional-metal clusters anchored on g-CN (TM4@g-CN) for CO2RR and found that all clusters have good stability on the substrate. Notably, the charge variation of the top metal atom (TM4) of six SCCs is close to zero which makes them readily donate electrons to the adsorbate CO2 and subsequent reaction intermediates. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to HCOOH on Ni4, Cu4, and Au4@g-CN with low limiting potentials of &#8722;0.21, &#8722;0.22, and &#8722;0.19 V, respectively, outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterparts. Both &#916;G(&#8727;CO2) and &#916;G(&#8727;OCHO/&#8727;COOH) exhibit a volcano relationship with the reaction activity, and the TM4 serves as electron reservoirs throughout the entire reaction process. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of cost-effective supported single cluster catalysts.</description>

      <title>Single atom catalysts with anion center toward oxygen electrocatalysis based on the conductive 1T-HfTe2</title>

                Advancing efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for commercializing emerging energy devices. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose doping different transition metal (TM) atoms to regulate the electronic structures of the two-dimensional 1T-HfTe2 monolayer to achieve bifunctional catalysis for the ORR/OER. Due to the small electronegativity of the Hf atom, we found the doped TMs can generally form anion centers by accepting abundant charges from the Hf interlayer. At the same time, the highly conductive 1T-HfTe2 contributes to the charge transfer between the active center and the reaction intermediates, rendering the designed SACs the tunable activity for the reactions. By comparing the theoretical overpotentials of ORR and OER on 15 single-atom catalysts (SACs), Pt-doped system exhibits excellent catalytic activity for both ORR and OER, outperforming the traditional Pt(1 1 1) and RuO2(1 1 0) catalysts. Based on the charge transfer mechanism, we clarified that the doped TM atoms act as a 'bridge' to transfer the electrons from the substrate to the reaction intermediates, thereby effectively contributing to the improvement of catalytic activity. In summary, our study shows that, by doping appropriate TM atoms, the intrinsic inert HfTe2 can be activated toward efficient ORR/OER. This could provide some guidance for the design of new two-dimensional ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst materials.</description>

                Abstract Common O-/H-down orientation of H2O molecules on electrocatalysts brings favorable OH/H delivery however adverse H/OH delivery in their dissociation process, hampering H2O dissociation kinetics of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To overcome this challenge, we raised a synergetic H2O dissociation concept of metal-supported electrocatalysts involving efficient OH delivery from O-down H2O to the metal, timely proton relay from O-down H2O on the metal to H-down H2O on the support through the hydrogen-bond network, and prompt H delivery from H-down H2O to the support. After theoretically profiling that a high work function difference between metal and support (&#916;&#934;) induces a strong electric field at the metal-support interface that increases hydrogen-bond connectivity to promote proton relay, we examined this concept over cobalt phosphide-supported ruthenium (Ru/CoP) catalysts with a high &#916;&#934; = 0.4 eV, reaching record high HER performance with a Ru utilization activity of 66.1 A mgRu-1 at a 100 mV overpotential.</description>

      <title>Database mining and first-principles assessment of organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevmaterials.8.054413</link>

                In organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics (OPTFe), molecules are linked to form hydrogen-bonded networks, and proton transfer (PT) between molecules is the dominant mechanism of ferroelectric switching. The fast-switching frequencies of OPTFes make them attractive alternatives to conventional ceramic ferroelectrics, which contain rare and/or toxic elements and require high processing temperatures. In this study, we mined the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) for potential OPTFes, uncovering most of the previously reported ones, both tautomeric compounds and acid-base salts, in addition to 12 new compounds, nine of which were tautomeric salts. The identification of PT tautomeric salts highlights a potential new avenue for engineering novel OPTFes. The CSD mining was based on identifying polar crystal structures with pseudoinversion symmetry and viable PT paths. The spontaneous polarization ${\mathbit{P}}_{\mathrm{s}}$ and the PT barriers ${U}_{\mathrm{PT}}$ were calculated for a selection of the compounds using density-functional theory.</description>

                The sunlight-driven reduction of CO2 into fuels and platform chemicals is a promising approach to enable a circular economy. However, established optimization approaches are poorly suited to multivariable multimetric photocatalytic systems because they aim to optimize one performance metric while sacrificing the others and thereby limit overall system performance. Herein, we address this multimetric challenge by defining a metric for holistic system performance that takes multiple figures of merit into account, and employ a machine learning algorithm to efficiently guide our experiments through the large parameter matrix to make holistic optimization accessible for human experimentalists. As a test platform, we employ a five-component system that self-assembles into photocatalytic micelles for CO2-to-CO reduction, which we experimentally optimized to simultaneously improve yield, quantum yield, turnover number, and frequency while maintaining high selectivity. Leveraging the data set with machine learning algorithms allows quantification of each parameter's effect on overall system performance. The buffer concentration is unexpectedly revealed as the dominating parameter for optimal photocatalytic activity, and is nearly four times more important than the catalyst concentration. The expanded use and standardization of this methodology to define and optimize holistic performance will accelerate progress in different areas of catalysis by providing unprecedented insights into performance bottlenecks, enhancing comparability, and taking results beyond comparison of subjective figures of merit.</description>

                Abstract We present a method combining first-principles calculations and machine learning to predict the redox potentials of half-cell reactions on the absolute scale. By applying machine learning force fields for thermodynamic integration from the oxidized to the reduced state, we achieve efficient statistical sampling over a broad phase space. Furthermore, through thermodynamic integration from machine learning force fields to potentials of semi-local functionals, and from semi-local functionals to hybrid functionals using &#916;-machine learning, we refine the free energy with high precision step-by-step. Utilizing a hybrid functional that includes 25% exact exchange (PBE0), this method predicts the redox potentials of the three redox couples, Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ , Cu 2+ /Cu + , and Ag 2+ /Ag + , to be 0.92, 0.26, and 1.99 V, respectively. These predictions are in good agreement with the best experimental estimates (0.77, 0.15, 1.98 V). This work demonstrates that machine-learned surrogate models provide a flexible framework for refining the accuracy of free energy from coarse approximation methods to precise electronic structure calculations, while also facilitating sufficient statistical sampling.</description>

                The different electrolyte conditions, e.g., pH value, for driving efficient HER and OER are one of the major issues hindering the aim for electrocatalytic water splitting in a high efficiency. In this regard, seeking durable and active HER electrocatalysts to align the alkaline conditions of the OER is a promising solution. However, the success in this strategy will depend on a fundamental understanding about the HER mechanism at the atomic scale. In this work, we have provided thorough understanding for the electrochemical HER mechanisms in KOH over Ni- and Co-based hollow pyrite microspheres by in operando X-ray spectroscopies and DFT calculations, including NiS</description>

      <title>Structure and ionic conduction enhancement mechanisms at CeO2/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces</title>

                Fluorite-perovskite heterointerfaces garner great interest for enhanced ionic conductivity for application in electronic and energy devices. However, the origin of observed enhanced ionic conductivity as well as the details of the atomic structure at these interfaces remain elusive. Here, systematic, multi-stoichiometry computational searches and experimental investigations are performed to obtain stable and exact atomic structures of interfaces between CeO2 and SrTiO3&#8212;two archetypes of the corresponding structural families. Local reconstructions take place at the interface because of mismatched lattices. TiO2 terminated SrTiO3 causes a buckled rock salt CeO interface layer to emerge. In contrast, SrO terminated SrTiO3 maintains the fluorite structure at the interface compensated by a partially occupied anion lattice. Moderate enhancement in oxygen diffusion is found along the interface by simulations, yet evidence to support further significant enhancement is lacking. Our findings demonstrate the control of interface termination as an effective pathway to achieve desired device performance.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is a pivotal scientific discipline and a crucial part of industrial processes for the sustainable future for mankind. It is closely related to energy efficiency and the general processing rate of various electrochemical applications. Thus, a sound understanding of electrocatalysis provides versatile new functions and innovative solutions to numerous challenges we face in conventional and advanced technologies. Particularly, the challenges regarding the need for sustainable energy and water use arise with growing demands for more environmentally friendly, safer, and energy-efficient materials, which are less dependent on limited resources. In terms of resolving these challenging demands, the emergence of nanomaterials has brought a significant advance in technologies and enabled an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of electrocatalysis. In this book chapter, we explore various electrochemical applications of both conventional and advanced technologies by categorizing them into five functioning groups: harvest, removal, consumption, storage, and analytics. For these applications with a particular aspect of sustainable energy and water, we discuss the roles and fundamentals of electrocatalysis, including technical parts such as cell configuration and its core elements, as well as the theories of thermodynamics and kinetics. Furthermore, we discuss how nanomaterials development and research activities have contributed to the deep understanding of nanoelectrocatalysis by reviewing some of the recent progress of various technologies. Finally, we explore the roles and the trend of these advanced nanomaterials in electrocatalysis with a focus on the properties and the design of materials.</description>

      <title>Porous TiN-based ceramic electrode with N-modified Co-based Nanorods/TiN heterointerfaces for efficient overall water splitting</title>

                The development of high-performance electrocatalytic electrodes for overall water splitting is a crucial issue to realize renewable hydrogen production. This paper presents the in situ growth of N-modified Co-based nanorods on porous TiN ceramic membranes using the hydrothermal method and thermal NH3 treatment, resulting in a novel self-supported electrocatalytic electrode with abundant heterointerfaces, denoted as NCTN-x-y (x: nitridation temperature; y: nitridation time). In the alkaline medium (1 M KOH), the NCTN-350-2 electrode displays the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity (&#414;10 = 66 mV), and the NCTN-250-3 electrode manifests the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (&#414;10 = 270 mV). Accordingly, these two electrodes comprise an electrolyzer, which features a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.63 V. The good electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the abundant heterointerfaces formed between the porous TiN ceramic membrane and the N-modified Co-based nanorods, in conjunction with the hierarchical pore structure of the TiN ceramic membrane. Theoretical calculations identify that the construction of heterointerfaces modulates the electronic structure of active sites, thereby promoting the dissociation of H2O, optimizing the H* adsorption energy (&#916;GH*), and accelerating the reaction kinetics, which ultimately improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrode.</description>

                Dynamic catalysis is a novel and promising approach that aims to improve the catalyst performance by modulating the binding energies of adsorbates to favor different reaction steps periodically. In this work, we investigate a unimolecular dynamic catalytic system, with a focus on methods for simulating the transient behavior and identifying the optimal wave parameters for the modulations. Employing the modeling language Pyomo and the solver IPOPT, we formulate a Boundary Value Problem with limit cycle conditions to obtain results with orders-of-magnitude improvements in computational efficiency when compared to forward integration methods. Leveraging this flexible approach, mathematical optimization was applied to the parameters of piecewise and continuous forcing functions to identify the maximum time-averaged turnover frequency (avTOF). We relate the results to the Extended Sabatier Volcano graphical representation, which provides insight into the behavior and optimal parameters of the target systems. Our results further support the notion that periodic shifts in rate-controlling elementary steps lead to a rate of reaction enhancement beyond the Sabatier limit.</description>

                Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) demonstrate an exceptional combination of properties. Rapid progress has extended their application beyond solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, and lasers to include memristors, artificial synapse devices, and pressure induced emission. In particular, the vacancy-ordered double perovskite Cs2TiBr6 has been identified as a promising material. The effective characterization of MHPs requires accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of electronic structure. Koopmans compliant (KC) functionals are an accurate and computationally efficient alternative to many-body perturbation theory using the GW approximation but have yet only been validated on a small number of simple materials. In this work, KC functionals were applied to the more complex case of Cs2TiBr6 and gave a zero-temperature fundamental gap of 4.28 eV, in close agreement with the value of 4.44 eV obtained using the accurate, but more computationally expensive, evGW0 approach. The temperature-dependent renormalization of the bandgap has also been investigated and found to be significant. Agreement with the experimental optical bandgaps of 1.76&#8211;2.0 eV would also require the inclusion of exciton binding energy.</description>

                Abstract Solid electrolytes hold substantial promise as vital components of all-solid-state batteries. Enhancing their performance necessitates simultaneous improvements in their stability and lithium conductivity. These properties can be calculated using first-principles simulations, provided that the crystal structure of the material and the diffusion pathway through the material are known. However, solid electrolytes typically incorporate dopants to enhance their properties, necessitating the optimization of the dopant configuration for the simulations. Yet, performing such calculations via the first-principles approach is so costly that existing approaches usually rely on predetermined dopant configurations informed by existing knowledge or are limited to systems doped with only a few atoms. The proposed method enables the optimization of the dopant configuration with the support of neural network potential (NNP). Our approach entails the use of molecular dynamics to analyze the diffusion after the optimization of the dopant configuration. The application of our approach to Li $$_{10}$$    10   MP $$_{2}$$    2   S $$_{12-x}$$     12 - x    O $$_{x}$$    x   (M = Ge, Si, or Sn) reproduce the experimental results well. Furthermore, analysis of the lithium diffusion pathways suggests that the activation energy of diffusion undergoes a percolation transition. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of NNPs in the systematic exploration of solid electrolytes.</description>

                Abstract Ru&#8208;based nanomaterials are promising alternatives to Pt electrocatalysts for green hydrogen energy generation, and crystal phase engineering holds the key to unlocking their catalytic potential to new heights. However, controllable phase regulation on Ru&#8208;alloys remains a formidable challenge, and unraveling the crystal phase&#8208;related electrocatalytic performance is of great significance. Herein, RuNi nanoparticles are successfully synthesized with an unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic ( fcc ) phase via a facile route. Comprehensive transmission electron microscopy confirmed the structural characteristics of the fcc &#8208;RuNi and electrochemical analyses indicate the impressive electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction of fcc &#8208;RuNi. Notably, the anomalous fcc &#8208;RuNi nanoparticles possess an extraordinarily low overpotential of 16 mV in hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations indicate that these nanoparticles are energetically conducive to intermediate desorption and H 2 O dissociation. This study enhances comprehension of phase regulation in Ru&#8208;based nanostructures and will propel phase engineering in diverse catalytic applications.</description>

                Transition metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been regarded as possible alternatives to platinum-based materials due to their satisfactory performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). By contrast, main-group metal elements are rarely studied due to their unfavorable surface and electronic states. Herein, a main-group Sn-based SAC with penta-coordinated and asymmetric first-shell ligands is reported as an efficient and robust ORR catalyst. The introduction of the vertical oxygen atom breaks the symmetric charge balance, modulating the binding strength to oxygen intermediates and decreasing the energy barrier for the ORR process. As expected, the prepared Sn SAC exhibits outstanding ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.912 V (vs RHE) and an excellent mass activity of 13.1 A mg</description>

      <title>V activated Ag-O catalytic sites for direct electro-epoxidation to successive producing propylene oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4390560/v1</link>
      <description>Zhongtao Li, Yan Lin, Xinyang Miao, Yi Sun, Hui Li, Hao Ren, Wenhao Cui, Mingbo Wu, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398169124

                Abstract As one environmentally friendly and sustainable method, direct electrooxidation of propylene (D-EOPO) can successively produce propylene oxide, but the poor selectivity and activity of the catalyst hinder the application. To overcome the issues, a D-EOPO device based on a membrane electrode reactor (MEA) has been developed with optimized Ag-V-O/GDL catalyst to active oxygen formation for propylene epoxidation. In-situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have revealed the critical role of introduced V, which can accelerate the formation of Ag-O to decrease the generation energy barriers of O* from absorbed water on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the V doping also can attribute to a positive shift of the d-band center of Ag, and facilitate the adsorption of propylene on the active center. Thus, the formation of the key intermediate (OC3H6*) by coupling O* with adsorbed propylene is synergistic promoted, thereby enabling the efficiency of D-EOPO. Finally, the MEA reactor with the developed Ag/V bimetallic catalyst have been developed for continuous D-EOPO, which can steadily electrooxidize propylene to PO with a yield of 64.48 &#181;mol/h over 72 hours (almost the highest among currently reports).</description>

      <title>Solvothermal Fabrication of Mesoporous Pd Nano-Corals at Mild Temperature for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14100876</link>

                Porous metallic nanomaterials exhibit interesting physical and chemical properties, and are widely used in various fields. Traditional fabrication techniques are limited to metallurgy, sintering, electrodeposition, etc., which limit the control of pore size and distribution, and make it difficult to achieve materials with high surface areas. On the other hand, the chemical preparation of metallic nanoparticles is usually carried out with strong reducing agents or at high temperature, resulting in the formation of dispersed particles which cannot evolve into porous metal. In this study, we reported the simple fabrication of coral-like mesoporous Pd nanomaterial (Pd NC) with a ligament size of 4.1 nm. The fabrication was carried out by simple solvothermal reduction at a mild temperature of 135 &#176;C, without using any templates. The control experiments suggested that tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) played a critical role in the Pd(II) reduction into Pd nanoclusters and their subsequent aggregation to form Pd NC, and another key point for the formation of Pd NC is not to use a strong reducing agent. In alkaline water electrolysis, the Pd NC outperforms the monodisperse Pd NPs and the state-of-the-art Pt (under large potentials) for H2 evolution reaction, probably due to its mesoporous structure and large surface area. This work reports a simple and novel method for producing porous metallic nanomaterials with a high utilization efficiency of metal atoms, and it is expected to contribute to the practical preparation of porous metallic nanomaterials by solvothermal reductions.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Electron Donating and Withdrawing Groups on Electrochemical Hydrogenolysis and Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c03032</link>

                The hydrogenolysis or hydrodeoxygenation of a carbonyl group, where the C&#9552;O group is converted to a CH2 group, is of significant interest in a variety of fields. A challenge in electrochemically achieving hydrogenolysis of a carbonyl group with high selectivity is that electrochemical hydrogenation of a carbonyl group, which converts the C&#9552;O group to an alcohol group (CH&#8211;OH), is demonstrated not to be the initial step of hydrogenolysis. Instead, hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis occur in parallel, and they are competing reactions. This means that although both hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation require adding H atoms to the carbonyl group, they involve different intermediates formed on the electrode surface. Thus, revealing the difference in intermediates, transition states, and kinetic barriers for hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation pathways is the key to understanding and controlling hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation selectivity of carbonyl compounds. In this study, we aimed to identify features of reactant molecules that can affect their hydrogenolysis/hydrogenation selectivity on a Zn electrode that was previously shown to promote hydrogenolysis over hydrogenation. In particular, we examined the electrochemical reduction of para-substituted benzaldehyde compounds with substituent groups having different electron donating/withdrawing abilities. Our results show a strikingly systematic impact of the substituent group where a stronger electron-donating group promotes hydrogenolysis and a stronger electron-withdrawing group promotes hydrogenation. These experimental results are presented with computational results explaining the substituent effects on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrochemical hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation pathways, which also provide critically needed information and insights into the transition states involved with these pathways.</description>

                Electrocatalysts in alkaline electrocatalytic water splitting are required to efficiently produce hydrogen while posing a challenge to show excellent performances. Herein, we have successfully synthesized platinum nanoparticles incorporated in a Co3O4 nanostructure (denoted as Pt-Co3O4) that show superior HER activity and stability in alkaline solutions (the overpotentials of 37 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity originates from synergistic effects between Pt and Co3O4 and increased electron conduction. Theoretical calculations show a significant decrease in the &#916;GH* of Co active sites and a remarkable increase in electron transport. Our work puts forward a special and simple synthesized way of adjusting the H* adsorption energy of an inert site for application in HER.</description>

                Abstract Supramolecular polymers hold promising application prospects in catalysis due to their distinctive molecular recognition and dynamic crosslinking features. However, investigating supramolecular organic electrocatalysts with high efficiency in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (ORHP) remains an unexplored frontier. Herein, we present organic polymers for ORHP by introducing cyclodextrin-containing noncovalent building blocks, and the skeleton electronic environment is further regulated via a host-guest chemistry strategy, affording HG-CD-Ph and HG-CD-TPB with abundant dynamic bonds. The oxygen intermediate desorption and electronic states are well-modulated through the host-guest decoration, resulting in appropriate regional electron binding force and controllable chemical activity. Notably, the introduction of supramolecular host-guest units into the polymer model P-CN-Ph achieves an ultra-high production rate of 9.14 mol g&#8722;1 cat h&#8722;1, and demonstrates an excellent Faraday efficiency of 98.01%, surpassing most reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Supported by theory calculation and in situ FT-IR experiment, it is revealed that C atoms (site&#8211;1) adjacent to &#8211;C=N (N) group are potential active sites. Moreover, the dynamic bonds in supramolecular catalysts can effectively regulate the binding ability of oxygen and its intermediates, leading to high reactivity and selectivity for the 2e&#8722; ORR. This work pioneers host-guest strategy and provides inspiring ideas for the ORHP process.</description>

                This study reports on the synthesis and characterization of an effective cathode paper electrode comprising comparatively inexpensive hydrous RuO2 (h-RuO2) nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes (CNT) for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. The concentration of hydrous RuO2 nanoparticles on the CNT was varied to assess their impact on the electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalytic performance of h-RuO2/CNT comprising 22.0 wt% of Ru was evaluated. Promising results were obtained, with a current density of -10 mA/cm2 at only 36 mV of overpotential and a mass activity of -2.41 A/gRu at 100 mV. Additionally, we conducted first-principles calculations to compare the HER catalytic activities of crystalline RuO2 and hydrous RuO2 with varying vacancies and to determine the H2O concentration in the structural lattice using free-energy diagrams. The study findings demonstrate that the h-RuO2/CNT paper can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for AEM water electrolysis.</description>

                Overpotential and &#916; G (*OH) have a volcanic relationship, the catalytic process is hindered by too strong or too weak interaction between catalyst and adsorbate. ORR is constrained in strong binding region by the reduction of *OH to H 2 O.</description>

                Inspired by the development of efficient, durable electrocatalytic functional materials to address the issues of kinetic retardation and mass transport to enhance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), one strategy is proposed for core-shell structural nitrogen-doped carbon with atomically dispersed binary platinum-nickel (Pt&#8211;Ni) atoms (N&#8211;C@Pt&#8211;Ni/N&#8211;C) with controlled bimetallic sites and adjusted electronic coordination environment. Practical application of experimental and simulated theoretical calculation results show the coordination microenvironment optimization for active site can promote the charge rearrangement of Pt&#8211;Ni sites, thus regulating the free energy of the reaction intermediates of oxygen-containing species. The N&#8211;C@Pt&#8211;Ni/N&#8211;C reveals astounding catalytic capacity during ORR, leading to a large power density (1472.6 &#177; 50.6 mW m&#8722;2) and long-term reliability (OCP by the current loss with 0.1 mA) in the actual microbial fuel cells. This work not only reveals controllable preparation of functional materials with binary isolated atomic dispersion, but also presents more perspective of electronic structure optimal performance enhancement relationship at the atomic-sized active sites.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Performance of Mo2C/MoS2 Composite Heterojunction Catalysts</title>

                Hydrogen, as a clean, safe, and efficient energy carrier, is one of the hot energy sources that have attracted much attention. Mo2C, due to the introduction of C atoms, makes the atomic spacing of the Mo lattice decrease and changes the width of the d-band, which makes the electronic properties of Mo2C similar to that of Pt noble metals, exhibiting excellent electrochemical hydrogen precipitation performance. MoS2, due to its special crystal structure and tunable electronic structure, has been widely studied. In this paper, Mo2C nanoparticles were prepared by high-temperature carbonization, and then two-dimensional layered MoS2 were be loaded on Mo2C nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method to synthesize Mo2C/MoS2 composite catalysts. Their electrochemical hydrogen precipitation (HER) performance under acidic conditions was tested. The above catalysts were also characterized by modern material testing methods such as XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The results showed that the composite catalysts exhibited the most excellent electrochemical hydrogen precipitation performance at Mo2C/MoS2-3, with the lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope, and electrochemical impedance. At the same time, the electrochemically active area was dramatically enhanced, with good stability under prolonged testing. The catalytic activity was significantly improved compared with that of Mo2C and MoS2. The characterization and experimental results indicate that the heterogeneous structure of Mo2C and MoS2 formed a built-in electric field between the two, which accelerated the electron transfer efficiency and provided more active sites. The Mo2C/MoS2 composite catalyst is a low-cost, easy-to-prepare, and high-efficiency electrochemical hydrogen precipitation catalyst, providing a new idea for developing green and clean energy.</description>
