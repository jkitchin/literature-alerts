      <title>Ammonolysis&#8208;Driven Exsolution of Ru Nanoparticle Embedded in Conductive Metal Nitride Matrix to Boost Electrocatalyst Activity</title>

      <description>So Yeon Yun, Sangseob Lee, Jin X, Aloysius Soon, Seong&#8208;Ju Hwang, Advanced science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394008309

                Abstract Exsolution is an effective method for synthesizing robust nanostructured metal&#8208;based functional materials. However, no studies have investigated the exsolution of metal nanoparticles into metal nitride substrates. In this study, a versatile nitridation&#8208;driven exsolution method is developed for embedding catalytically active metal nanoparticles in conductive metal nitride substrates via the ammonolysis of multimetallic oxides. Using this approach, Ti 1&#8722;x Ru x O 2 nanowires are phase&#8208;transformed into holey TiN nanotubes embedded with exsolved Ru nanoparticles. These Ru&#8208;exsolved holey TiN nanotubes exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with excellent durability, which is significantly higher than that of Ru&#8208;deposited TiN nanotubes. The enhanced stability of the Ru&#8208;exsolved TiN nanotubes can be attributed to the Ru nanoparticles embedded in the robust metal nitride matrix and the formation of interfacial Ti 3+ &#9472;N&#9472;Ru 4+ bonds. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the exsolved Ru nanoparticles have a lower d &#8208;band center position and optimized hydrogen affinity than deposited Ru nanoparticles, indicating the superior electrocatalyst performance of the former. In situ Raman spectroscopic analysis reveals that the electron transfer from TiN to Ru nanoparticles is enhanced during the electrocatalytic process. The proposed approach opens a new avenue for stabilizing diverse metal nanostructures in many conductive matrices like metal phosphides and chalcogenides.</description>

                Abstract Improving the kinetics and selectivity of CO 2 /CO electroreduction to valuable multi-carbon products is a challenge for science and is a requirement for practical relevance. Here we develop a thiol-modified surface ligand strategy that promotes electrochemical CO-to-acetate. We explore a picture wherein nucleophilic interaction between the lone pairs of sulfur and the empty orbitals of reaction intermediates contributes to making the acetate pathway more energetically accessible. Density functional theory calculations and Raman spectroscopy suggest a mechanism where the nucleophilic interaction increases the sp 2 hybridization of CO (ad) , facilitating the rate-determining step, CO* to (CHO)*. We find that the ligands stabilize the (HOOC&#8211;CH 2 )* intermediate, a key intermediate in the acetate pathway. In-situ Raman spectroscopy shows shifts in C&#8211;O, Cu&#8211;C, and C&#8211;S vibrational frequencies that agree with a picture of surface ligand-intermediate interactions. A Faradaic efficiency of 70% is obtained on optimized thiol-capped Cu catalysts, with onset potentials 100 mV lower than in the case of reference Cu catalysts.</description>

                Abstract The shortage and unevenness of fossil energy sources are affecting the development and progress of human civilization. The technology of efficiently converting material resources into energy for utilization and storage is attracting the attention of researchers. Environmentally friendly biomass materials are a treasure to drive the development of new&#8208;generation energy sources. Electrochemical theory is used to efficiently convert the chemical energy of chemical substances into electrical energy. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of green and economical electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Although many reviews have been reported around the application of biomass&#8208;derived catalytically active carbon (CAC) catalysts in ORR, these reviews have only selected a single/partial topic (including synthesis and preparation of catalysts from different sources, structural optimization, or performance enhancement methods based on CAC catalysts, and application of biomass&#8208;derived CACs) for discussion. There is no review that systematically addresses the latest progress in the synthesis, performance enhancement, and applications related to biomass&#8208;derived CAC&#8208;based oxygen reduction electrocatalysts synchronously. This review fills the gap by providing a timely and comprehensive review and summary from the following sections: the exposition of the basic catalytic principles of ORR, the summary of the chemical composition and structural properties of various types of biomass, the analysis of traditional and the latest popular biomass&#8208;derived CAC synthesis methods and optimization strategies, and the summary of the practical applications of biomass&#8208;derived CAC&#8208;based oxidative reduction electrocatalysts. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the latest advances to provide research directions and design ideas for the development of catalyst synthesis/optimization and contributes to the industrialization of biomass&#8208;derived CAC electrocatalysis and electric energy storage.</description>

      <title>Breaking Symmetry: Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Performance of Janus Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COT (T = F, Cl, Br, I) MXenes by Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c00812</link>

                This investigation highlights the significant impact of asymmetric Janus Zr2COT (T = F, Cl, Br, I) monolayers on enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Employing density functional theory (DFT), our research demonstrates that introducing asymmetric functional groups into Zr2COT structures effectively tailors their electronic properties, leading to a marked improvement in HER activity. This structural innovation notably reduces the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) from 0.877 eV for the symmetric Zr2CO2 to below 0.2 eV for the Janus Zr2COT configurations, with Zr2COBr and Zr2COI achieving exceptionally low &#916;GH* values of 0.045 and &#8722;0.042 eV, respectively, at a hydrogen coverage of 1/4. The monolayers also exhibit remarkable thermal stability and superior electrical conductivity, vital for high-efficiency electrocatalysis. Furthermore, strain engineering underscores the durability of these materials, maintaining &#916;GH* values within &#177;0.2 eV under extensive tensile strain and emphasizing their practical application potential. Crucially, this work uncovers the critical role of electronic structure adjustments in optimizing the HER performance, aligning with the Sabatier principle, and offering fresh perspectives for designing effective, cost-efficient electrocatalysts. In a word, Janus Zr2COT monolayers emerge as promising candidates, challenging traditional noble metal catalysts and paving the way for the development of sustainable electrocatalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Transition metal-based chalcogenides as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in hydrogen energy production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.275</link>
      <description>Umer Shahzad, Mohsin Saeed, Hadi M. Marwani, Jehan Y. Al&#8208;Humaidi, S. Rehman, Raed H. Althomali, Mohammed M. Rahman, International journal of hydrogen energy. 65(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394019055

                The main and significant element in the energy system is hydrogen atom. In addition, electrochemical water splitting is among the most crucial approaches for displacing the extensively utilized petroleum and petroleum products. It is crucial to look for effective electro-catalysts to split the water molecule to produce hydrogen. Because of their good conductivity, distinctive outer shell electronic distribution, and various superficial structural nano-morphology, transition metal chalcogenides are very attractive as effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen production. Currently synthesized transition metal-built chalcogens (containing Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium) as efficient catalysts for general splitting of target water using hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), have been discussed in this review.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Prediction and Synthesis of Nonmetal-Doped Anatase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (101) for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

                TiO2-based photocatalysts are eco-friendly, cost-effective, and stable but only exert catalytic performance in the ultraviolet region, and the photocatalytic efficiency is very low. In this work, we employ DFT calculations to deeply investigate the effect of nonmetallic C-doped TiO2 (101) on the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Specifically, the effects of C substitution or interstitial doping at the surface, subsurface, and bulk on the electronic structure, optical properties, and catalytic hydrogen evolution activity were substantially investigated. We discovered that different C atom doping strategies impinge different effects on the catalytic activity. Among them, the CO-bulk4, CTi-surf2, and Cinter-surf systems showed superior catalytic activities with &#916;G of &#8722;0.012, &#8722;0.055, and &#8722;0.024 eV, respectively. The C atom replaces the Ti atom and alters the original coordination environment, which leads to charge redistribution and consequently to the activation of the O sites. Additionally, carbon-self-doped TiO2 photocatalysts were fabricated using an experimental hydrothermal synthesis, and the XPS analyses confirmed that O is replaced by C. In addition, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is 0.3 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, while there is no hydrogen evolution for pure TiO2. Our findings suggest that nonmetallic doped TiO2(101) photocatalysts can improve light absorption, modulate charge distribution, and enhance hydrogen evolution activity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Mechanism of the Electrochemical Polymerization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Hard Carbon over CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(110)</title>

                Conversion of CO2 to hard carbon is an interesting technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Recently, it was shown that CeO2 can selectively catalyze this reaction, but we still lack information regarding the reaction mechanism. Using density functional theory modeling, we explore possible reaction mechanisms that allow for the polymerization of CO2. According to our computations, the reaction is initialized by the adsorption of CO2 in an oxygen vacancy. Owing to the rich defect chemistry of ceria, a large number of suitable sites are available at the surface. C&#8211;C bond formation is achieved through an aldol condensation-type mechanism which comprises the electrochemical elimination of water to form a carbene. This carbene then performs a nucleophilic attack on CO2. The reaction mechanism possesses significant similarities to the corresponding reactions in synthetic organic chemistry. Since the mechanism is completely generic, it allows for all relevant steps of the formation of hard carbon like chain growth, chain linkage, and the formation of side chains or aromatic rings. Surprisingly, ceria mainly serves as an anchor for CO2 in an oxygen vacancy, while all other subsequent reaction steps are almost completely independent from the catalyst. These insights are important for the development of novel catalysts for CO2 reduction and may also lead to new reactions for the electrosynthesis of organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Self-induced long-range surface strain improves oxygen reduction reaction</title>

                For decades, it has been recognized that alloying platinum (Pt) with a secondary metal can enhance the catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to pristine Pt catalysts. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon vary significantly from one alloy to another. Here, we report the results of a computational study on the origin of the experimentally observed enhanced ORR activity of AgxPt1-x/Pt(1 1 1) monolayer surface alloy with 7 %-50 % Ag contents. A phase-separation model was developed and able to generate 2D phase-separation distributions of Ag and Pt atoms in AgxPt1-x/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces in line with atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscopy. We employed DFT-calculated *OH adsorption energy as a descriptor to obtain the activity of those surfaces, which reveals the ORR activity dominated by the reaction on Pt(Pt6) heptamers and also gives evidence of long-range self-induced surface strain as the source of the enhanced activity of binary AgxPt1-x/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, i.e., the slightly larger surface Ag atoms induce a compressive strain of Pt-Pt bonds of the Pt(Pt6) heptamers, which increases the activity of binary surfaces compared to the pristine Pt(1 1 1) surface. Moreover, the excellent simulated-experimental agreement for the polarization curves shows the high quality of this approach and its more general potential for an improved understanding of the catalytic properties of inhomogeneous binary surfaces as the basis for a rational design of binary catalysts.</description>

      <title>Giant In-Plane Flexoelectricity and Radial Polarization in Janus IV&#8211;VI Monolayers and Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c01527</link>
      <description>Kai Zheng, Tejs Vegge, Ivano E. Castelli, ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394566694

                Nanotubes have established a new paradigm in nanoscience because of their atomically thin geometries and intriguing properties. However, because of their typical metastability compared to their 2D and 3D counterparts, it is still fundamentally challenging to synthesize nanotubes with controlled size. New strategies have been suggested for synthesizing nanotubes with a controlled geometry. One of these is considering Janus 2D layers, which can self-roll to form a nanotube. Herein, we study 412 nanotubes (along the armchair and zigzag directions) based on 36 Janus IV-VI compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By investigating the energy-radius relationship using structural models and Bayesian predictions, the most stable nanotubes show negative strain energies and radii below 20 &#197;, where curvature effects can play a significant role. The band structures show that the selected nanotubes exhibit sizable band gaps and size-dependent electronic properties. More strikingly, the flexoelectricity along the in-plane directions and radial directions in these nanotubes is significantly larger than that in other nanotubes and their 2D counterparts. This work opens up an avenue of structure-property relationships of Janus IV-VI nanotubes and demonstrates giant flexoelectricity in these nanotubes for future electronic and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Promotion of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Programmable Metal Oxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c00365</link>
      <description>Sallye R. Gathmann, Christopher J. Bartel, Lars C. Grabow, Omar A. Abdelrahman, C. Daniel Frisbie, Paul J. Dauenhauer, ACS energy letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394568896

                Hydrogen gas is a promising renewable energy storage medium when produced via water electrolysis, but this process is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we used a microkinetic model to investigate promoting the OER using programmable oxide catalysts (i.e., forced catalyst dynamics). We found that programmable catalysts could increase current density at a fixed overpotential (100&#8211;600&#215; over static rates) or reduce the overpotential required to reach a fixed current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 (45&#8211;140% reduction vs static). In our kinetic parametrization, the key parameters controlling the quality of the catalytic ratchet were the O*-to-OOH* and O*-to-OH* activation barriers. Our findings indicate that programmable catalysts may be a viable strategy for accelerating the OER or enabling lower-overpotential operation, but a more accurate kinetic parametrization is required for precise predictions of performance, ratchet quality, and resulting energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Iridium&#8208;Yttrium Alloy Catalyst for Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202304479</link>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis holds great promise in revolutionizing clean energy production by enabling the efficient generation of hydrogen. Nevertheless, a formidable challenge persists in the realm of designing electrocatalysts that are both highly active and acid&#8208;resistant during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby mitigating the substantial kinetic barrier. In this study, the facile synthesis of iridium&#8208;yttrium (IrY) alloy nanocatalysts via a thermal shock method is introduced, which exhibits exceptional activity in the context of acidic water oxidation. Through the strategic incorporation of dispersed Y into the lattice of Ir metal, the IrY catalyst demonstrates a notably low overpotential of 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and showcases remarkable catalytic stability in acidic electrolytes, enduring for over 500 h with a high current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Through a comprehensive set of in situ characterizations and analytical methods, the formation of a surface Ir&#8208;based oxide layer, induced by deprotonation and electrochemical oxidation is unveiled, which is notably stabilized by the presence of Y dopants. This stabilization of the active site imparts enhanced resistance to over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution, underpinning the exceptional stability of the catalyst. Theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of Y into the catalyst structure has a significant impact on enhancing the reactivity of the oxygen intermediate (O*) at adjacent Ir sites, thus lowering the overpotential and promoting OER activity. The alloying approach presents a straightforward method for achieving atomic&#8208;level modifications in catalyst design and can pave the way for the development of more effective and economically viable OER catalysts and beyond.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of Water Splitting and Oxygen Reduction Via &lt;scp&gt;Single&#8208;Atom&lt;/scp&gt; Anchoring on Graphyne Support</title>

                Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have received significant interest for optimizing metal atom utilization and superior catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we investigate a range of single&#8208;transition metal (STM 1 = Sc 1 , Ti 1 , V 1 , Cr 1 , Mn 1 , Fe 1 , Co 1 , Ni 1 , Cu 1 , Zr 1 , Nb 1 , Mo 1 , Ru 1 , Rh 1 , Pd 1 , Ag 1 , W 1 , Re 1 , Os 1 , Ir 1 , Pt 1 , and Au 1 ) atoms supported on graphyne (GY) surface for HER/OER and ORR using first&#8208;principle calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and phonon dispersion spectra reveal the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the GY surface. The exceptional stability of all supported STM 1 atoms within the H1 cavity of the GY surface exists in an isolated form, facilitating the uniform distribution and proper arrangement of single atoms on GY. In particular, Sc 1 , Co 1 , Fe 1 , and Au 1 /GY demonstrate promising catalytic efficiency in the HER due to idealistic &#916;G H* values via the Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky pathway. Notably, Sc 1 and Au 1 /GY exhibit superior HER catalytic activity compared to other studied catalysts. Co 1 /GY catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and activity for the OER, with an overpotential (0.46 V) comparable to MoC 2 , IrO 2 , and RuO 2 . Also, Rh 1 and Co 1 /GY SACs exhibited promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, with an overpotential of 0.36 and 0.46 V, respectively. Therefore, Co 1 /GY is a versatile electrocatalyst for metal&#8208;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting. This study further incorporates computational analysis of the kinetic potential energy barriers of Co 1 and Rh 1 in the OER and ORR. A strong correlation is found between the estimated kinetic activation barriers for the thermodynamic outcomes and all proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. We establish a relation for the Gibbs free energy of intermediates to understand the mechanism of SACs supported on STM 1 /GY and introduce a key descriptor. This study highlights GY as a favorable single&#8208;atom support for designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective versatile electrocatalysts for practical applications.</description>

                Single-atom alloys (SAAs) have attracted considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts in reactions central to energy conversion and chemical transformation. In contrast to monometallic nanocrystals and metal alloys, SAAs possess unique and intriguing physicochemical properties, positioning them as ideal model systems for studying structure&#8211;property relationships. However, the field is still in its early stages. In this Perspective, we first review and summarize rational synthesis methods and advanced characterization techniques for SAA nanoparticle catalysts. We then emphasize the extensive applications of SAAs in a range of electrocatalytic reactions, including fuel cell reactions, water splitting, and carbon dioxide and nitrate reductions. Finally, we provide insights into existing challenges and prospects associated with the controlled synthesis, characterization, and design of SAA catalysts.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Insight into the Mechanistic Study of Electrochemical Cyanide Reduction Reaction on Post-Transition Metal Based Single-Atom Catalysts Anchored by Phthalocyanine Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.3c05646</link>

                As a catalytic center, the 4N-coordinated post-transition metal (PM) confined within phthalocyanine (Pc) shows promise for the environmentally friendly synthesis of CH4 and NH3. A range of PM&#8211;Pc catalysts (where PM represents Al, Ga, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, and Bi) is methodically evaluated through DFT mechanistic analysis and electrochemical exploration to determine their stability, activity, and selectivity. Our comparative analysis reveals that the orientational specificity of initial cyanide adsorption would play a crucial role in cyanide electroreduction reaction (CNRR) pathways within diverse PM&#8211;Pc nanosheets. Specifically, the NC* model typically requires higher supplies of Gibbs free energy for the CNRR, preponderantly resulting in CH3NH2. Conversely, the counterpart of the CN* model necessitates lower energetic demands, leading to a broader diversity of products including methane and ammonia. Of particular significance that the relationships of limiting potentials (UL) through two types of descriptors, &#916;GNC*&#8594;HNC* and &#916;GCN*&#8594;HCN*, were essential for constructing volcano plots, thus illustrating the relation within the intrinsic adsorption performance of diverse PM&#8211;Pc series and their associated prominent CNRR efficiency. From a comprehensive screening of the studied results, we have determined that the nanosheets Al&#8211;Pc, In&#8211;Pc, Ge&#8211;Pc, and Sn&#8211;Pc (triggered by the CN* model) are the exceptionally proficient electrocatalysts, specifically in producing only CH4 and NH3 via the CNRR process, as indicated by our final compiled findings. Within the range of nanosheets evaluated, the Al&#8211;Pc associated model emerges as a standout, demonstrating markedly higher selectivity and CNRR activity than its counterparts. This study advances the understanding of the unique superior characteristics of SACs, subsequently providing innovative perspectives that could directly guide their discovery for CNRR applications.</description>

      <title>What we talk about when we talk about breaking scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0192779</link>
      <description>Federico Calle&#8208;Vallejo, Applied physics reviews. 11(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394606253

                For more than a dozen years, &#8220;breaking scaling relations&#8221; has been regarded by many as a top priority in computational and experimental electrocatalysis. Numerous works claim to have done it, and literature reviews are available that summarize the strategies to do it. However, in most cases, it seems more like a slogan than a clear, experimentally realizable catalyst design paradigm. It is worth asking whether we know of any materials that unmistakably break scaling relations and, more importantly, if the breaking of a problematic scaling relation is the end of all troubles in electrocatalysis. On the basis of some quantitative examples related to CO2 electroreduction and the concept of &#8220;ghost scaling relation,&#8221; I will try to address these and other fundamental questions related to scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Massively scalable workflows for quantum chemistry: &lt;scp&gt;BigChem&lt;/scp&gt; and &lt;scp&gt;ChemCloud&lt;/scp&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0190834</link>
      <description>Colton B. Hicks, Todd J. Mart&#305;&#769;nez, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(14)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394608928

                Electronic structure theory, i.e., quantum chemistry, is the fundamental building block for many problems in computational chemistry. We present a new distributed computing framework (BigChem), which allows for an efficient solution of many quantum chemistry problems in parallel. BigChem is designed to be easily composable and leverages industry-standard middleware (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis) for distributed approaches to large scale problems. BigChem can harness any collection of worker nodes, including ones on cloud providers (such as AWS or Azure), local clusters, or supercomputer centers (and any mixture of these). BigChem builds upon MolSSI packages, such as QCEngine to standardize the operation of numerous computational chemistry programs, demonstrated here with Psi4, xtb, geomeTRIC, and TeraChem. BigChem delivers full utilization of compute resources at scale, offers a programable canvas for designing sophisticated quantum chemistry workflows, and is fault tolerant to node failures and network disruptions. We demonstrate linear scalability of BigChem running computational chemistry workloads on up to 125 GPUs. Finally, we present ChemCloud, a web API to BigChem and successor to TeraChem Cloud. ChemCloud delivers scalable and secure access to BigChem over the Internet.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Interfacial Electric Field in Metal Phosphide Heterojunction by Fe&#8208;Doping for Large&#8208;Current Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Developing non-precious-metal electrocatalysts that can operate with a low overpotential at a high current density for industrial application is challenging. Heterogeneous bimetallic phosphides have attracted much interest. Despite high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, the ordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance hinders their practical use. Herein, it is shown that Fe-doping reverses and enlarges the interfacial electrical field at the heterojunction, turning the H intermediate favorable binding sites for HER into O intermediate favorable sites for OER. Specifically, the self-supported heterojunction catalysts on nickel foam (CoP@Ni2P/NF and Fe-CoP@Fe-Ni2P/NF) are readily synthesized. They only require the overpotentials of 266 and 274 mV to drive a large current density of 1000 mA cm-2 (j1000) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, a water splitting cell equipped with these electrodes only requires a voltage of 1.724 V to drive j1000 with excellent durability, demonstrating the potential of industrial application. This work offers new insights on interfacial engineering for heterojunction catalysts.</description>

      <title>Platinum-Modified Cobalt Oxide/Cobalt Nanotubes as Multifunctional Electrocatalysts in Alkaline and Acidic Conditions</title>

                Nanostructure platinum is an effective catalyst that is active toward a broad range of electrochemical processes over a wide range of pH values. However, its high cost and low abundance prevent its widespread use in practical devices. A promising strategy to overcome the limitations of platinum is to combine platinum with less expensive and more abundant transition metals. In this report, we employ an ambient, template-based approach to prepare monodisperse Co nanotubes (NTs) and modify them with platinum via an electroless deposition process. The composition of the resulting Pt modified Co NTs (Pt-Co NTs) can be varied by controlling the Pt ion concentration in the electroless deposition step. The resulting Pt-Co NTs have a hierarchical structure consisting of Pt-Co NTs coated with an amorphous Co-oxide film. The amorphous Co-oxide coating activates the Pt-Co NTs to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leading to a 9-fold enhancement in the OER activity in an 80% (by mass) Pt-Co NT relative to pure Pt nanowires. The surface oxide coating can be selectively removed by cycling the Pt-Co NTs in an acidic solution. Removing the oxide film activates the Pt-Co NTs toward methanol oxidation (MOR) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. In both cases, the trends in MOR and ORR activity follow a volcano-type dependence as a function of composition. The catalyst with the optimum composition of 60% Pt has a 4-fold increase in the specific activity for MOR and maintains a +20 mV shift in the half-wave potential for ORR relative to that of pure Pt nanowires.</description>
