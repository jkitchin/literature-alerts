      <title>Achieving Negatively Charged Pt Single Atoms on Amorphous Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets with Promoted Hydrogen Absorption in Hydrogen Evolution</title>

                Abstract Single-atom (SA) catalysts with nearly 100% atom utilization have been widely employed in electrolysis for decades, due to the outperforming catalytic activity and selectivity. However, most of the reported SA catalysts are fixed through the strong bonding between the dispersed single metallic atoms with nonmetallic atoms of the substrates, which greatly limits the controllable regulation of electrocatalytic activity of SA catalysts. In this work, Pt&#8211;Ni bonded Pt SA catalyst with adjustable electronic states was successfully constructed through a controllable electrochemical reduction on the coordination unsaturated amorphous Ni(OH) 2 nanosheet arrays. Based on the X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and first-principles calculations, Pt SA was bonded with Ni sites of amorphous Ni(OH) 2 , rather than conventional O sites, resulting in negatively charged Pt &#948; &#8722; . In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that the changed configuration and electronic states greatly enhanced absorbability for activated hydrogen atoms, which were the essential intermediate for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The hydrogen spillover process was revealed from amorphous Ni(OH) 2 that effectively cleave the H&#8211;O&#8211;H bond of H 2 O and produce H atom to the Pt SA sites, leading to a low overpotential of 48 mV in alkaline electrolyte at &#8722;1000 mA cm &#8722;2 mg &#8722;1 Pt , evidently better than commercial Pt/C catalysts. This work provided new strategy for the controllable modulation of the local structure of SA catalysts and the systematic regulation of the electronic states.</description>

      <title>Recent progress and perspective on electrocatalysis in neutral media: Mechanisms, materials, and advanced characterizations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/idm2.12172</link>

                Abstract Electrocatalysis, which involves oxidation and reduction reactions with direct electron transfer, is essential for a variety of clean energy conversion devices. Currently, the vast majority of studies regarding electrocatalysis reactions focus on strong acidic or alkaline media because of the higher catalytic activity. Nevertheless, some inherent drawbacks, including the corrosive environment, expensive proton exchange membranes, and side effects, are still hard to break through. A sustainably promising way to overcome these shortcomings is to deploy neutral/near&#8208;neutral electrolytes for electrocatalysis reactions. Unfortunately, insufficient research in this area due to the lack of attention to related issues has slowed down the development process. In this review, we systematically review the catalytic reaction mechanisms, neutral electrolytes, electrocatalysts, and modification strategies carried out in neutral media on the three most common electrocatalytic reactions, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the advanced characterization tools for guiding catalyst synthesis and mechanistic studies are also summarized. Eventually, we propose some challenges and perspectives on electrocatalysis reactions in neutral media and hope it will attract more research interest and provide guidance in neutral electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Chemical Descriptors by Machine Learning Reveals Atomistic Insights into Solute&#8211;Lipid Interactions</title>

                This study explores the research area of drug solubility in lipid excipients, an area persistently complex despite recent advancements in understanding and predicting solubility based on molecular structure. To this end, this research investigated novel descriptor sets, employing machine learning techniques to understand the determinants governing interactions between solutes and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) were constructed on an extended solubility data set comprising 182 experimental values of structurally diverse drug molecules, including both development and marketed drugs to extract meaningful property relationships. Four classes of molecular descriptors, ranging from traditional representations to complex geometrical descriptions, were assessed and compared in terms of their predictive accuracy and interpretability. These include two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) descriptors, Abraham solvation parameters, extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs), and the smooth overlap of atomic position (SOAP) descriptor. Through testing three distinct regularized regression algorithms alongside various preprocessing schemes, the SOAP descriptor enabled the construction of a superior performing model in terms of interpretability and accuracy. Its atom-centered characteristics allowed contributions to be estimated at the atomic level, thereby enabling the ranking of prevalent molecular motifs and their influence on drug solubility in MCTs. The performance on a separate test set demonstrated high predictive accuracy (RMSE = 0.50) for 2D and 3D, SOAP, and Abraham Solvation descriptors. The model trained on ECFP4 descriptors resulted in inferior predictive accuracy. Lastly, uncertainty estimations for each model were introduced to assess their applicability domains and provide information on where the models may extrapolate in chemical space and, thus, where more data may be necessary to refine a data-driven approach to predict solubility in MCTs. Overall, the presented approaches further enable computationally informed formulation development by introducing a novel in silico approach for rational drug development and prediction of dose loading in lipids.</description>

      <title>Computational Investigation of LiF Formation at Graphite&#8211;Electrolyte Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c01719</link>

                The performance of rechargeable batteries is strongly influenced by the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI), and a comprehensive understanding of SEI formation from the atomic level is crucial for effective battery design. The dynamics of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is important and needs to be considered when evaluating the mechanism of the SEI formation. Here, we employed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine interfacial behaviors and LiF formation. Through molecular dynamics and structure sampling, we successfully constructed an electrochemical stability diagram correlating the thermodynamic free energy with the potential, which is determined by the work function of electrode surfaces. DFT calculations revealed that LiF formation at the graphite&#8211;electrolyte interfaces occurs easily via the intermediate LiHF complex. Interestingly, LiF tends to be solvated by solvents rather than directly deposited onto electrode surfaces (e.g., the Au electrode), a phenomenon we identify as a critical determinant of the porous and uneven nature of the LiF layer observed on graphite electrodes. Our finding offers new mechanistic insights into LiF formation at graphite&#8211;electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <title>Effects of Oxygen Vacancies with Different Valence States on the Photo(electro)catalytic Performance of a 2D TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:N (001) System</title>

                The effect of different valence states Vo on the photo(electro)catalytic performance of the 2D TiO2:N system was investigated using the GGA+U method with first principles. In the poor oxygen conditions, the Ef values of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0/Vo1+/Vo2+) systems are all less than zero, and all of them are exothermic. Photocatalytic investigations revealed that among the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+), 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+), and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) systems, the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system has the best carrier activity, the longest electron&#8211;hole lifetime, prominent visible light, infrared light redshift, and outstanding oxidation ability. The photocatalytic decomposition of water and oxygen evolution is highly advantageous. Electrocatalytic studies showed that compared with the free energy of 2D Ti24O46N (Vo1+) and 2D Ti24O46N (Vo2+) systems the free energy &#916;GH* of the 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is &#8722;0.156 eV and the smallest, which is conducive to hydrogen evolution. The overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction is 0.360 V, which is close to zero, and the four reaction processes are all downward, indicating that the OER reaction can be driven independently by the photogenerated holes, which is conducive to the electrocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the ability of decomposing water is relatively good. The 2D Ti24O46N (Vo0) system is a candidate nanomaterial and can be applied as a novel photoelectric catalyst.</description>

                We develop an adaptive scheme in the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, where the adsorption and activation energies of all elementary steps, including the effects of other adsorbates, are evaluated &#8220;on-the-fly&#8221; by employing the neural network potentials. The configurations and energies evaluated during the simulations are stored for reuse when the same configurations are sampled in a later step. The present scheme is applied to hydrogen adsorption and diffusion on the Pd(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and the CO oxidation reaction on the Pt(111) surface. The effects of interactions between adsorbates, i.e., adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate lateral interactions, are examined in detail by comparing the simulations without considering lateral interactions. This study demonstrates the importance of lateral interactions in surface diffusion and reactions and the potential of our scheme for applications in a wide variety of heterogeneous catalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Optimization and prediction of catalysts for precise synthesis of methyl glycolate from dimethyl oxalate using machine learning coupled with particle swarm optimization algorithm</title>

      <description>Qingchun Yang, Jianhui Zhou, Renlie Bao, Dai Rong, Lei Zhao, Dawei Zhang, Chemical engineering science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398794749

                To optimize and predict the catalyst for precise synthesis of methyl glycolate (MG) from dimethyl oxalate, this study proposed a six-step machine learning framework coupled with a particle swarm optimization algorithm. The random forest (RF) model has the highest prediction accuracy after optimizing its hyperparameters. This preferred model has been rigorously validated using experimental data, showcasing a remarkable level of consistency with the observed trends. Then the catalytic performance of the dimethyl oxalate to methyl glycolate (DtMG) process is evaluated by the feature importance analysis and partial dependence plot approaches. It is recommended to operate at lower temperatures and pressures, higher space velocities, and hydrogen-to-ester ratio for MG production. Finally, the RF model coupled with the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to predict the optimal catalyst for maximizing MG yield and minimizing cost of the DtMG process, which successfully predicts seven new catalysts with higher yields and lower costs.</description>

                The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia reaction (ENO3RR) holds great potential as a cost-effective method for synthesizing ammonia. This work designed a cerium (Ce) doped Cu2+1O/Cu3VO4 catalyst. The coupling of vanadium-based oxides with Cu2+1O effectively adjusts the catalyst's electronic structure, addressing the inherent issues of limited activity and low conductivity in typical copper-based oxides; moreover, Ce doping generates oxygen vacancies (Ov), providing more active sites and thereby enhancing the ENO3RR performance. The catalyst exhibits superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency (93.7 %) with a NH3 yield of 18.905 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE under alkaline conditions. This study provides guidance for the design of highly efficient catalysts for ENO3RR.</description>

                Abstract Efficient and durable electrocatalysts toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are of great significance for the widespread application of anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Numerous single&#8208;phase catalysts, such as Ru 2 P, have been explored as efficient HER catalysts; however, many have failed to overcome the inherent sluggish kinetics of the two separate steps involved in the alkaline HER: water dissociation and hydrogen production. In this study, density functional theory calculations are conducted to identify promising combinations of Ir 2 P and Ru 2 P materials that promote fast cascade water dissociation and H 2 production via kinetically favorable hydrogen spillover from the Ru 2 P surface to the adjacent Ir 2 P. An unprecedented construction of Ir 2 P cluster&#8208;decorated Ru 2 P hollow nanotubes ( c &#8208;RP/IP HNTs), which feature a cooperative heterostructural synergy are developed. This configuration shows greater performance than commercial Pt/C, achieving an overpotential of 23.2 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722; 2 and maintaining long&#8208;term stability for 55 h in half&#8208;cell tests. Furthermore, the practical AEMWE test, incorporating c &#8208;RP/IP HNTs, demonstrated a remarkable single&#8208;cell performance of 12.23 A cm &#8722;2 at 2.0 V and operated stably under 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 for over 250 h. This surpasses that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton&#8208;exchange membrane WE.</description>

                Abstract Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials exhibit the potential to transform semiconductor technology. Their rich compositional and stacking varieties allow tailoring materials&#8217; properties toward device applications. Monolayer to multilayer gallium sulfide (GaS) with its ultraviolet band gap, which can be tuned by varying the layer number, holds promise for solar&#8208;blind photodiodes and light&#8208;emitting diodes as applications. However, achieving commercial viability requires wafer&#8208;scale integration, contrasting with established, limited methods such as mechanical exfoliation. Here the one&#8208;step synthesis of 2D GaS is introduced via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrates. The pulsed&#8208;mode deposition of industry&#8208;standard precursors promotes 2D growth by inhibiting the vapor phase and on&#8208;surface pre&#8208;reactions. The interface chemistry with the growth of a Ga adlayer that results in an epitaxial relationship is revealed. Probing structure and composition validate thin&#8208;film quality and 2D nature with the possibility to control the thickness by the number of GaS pulses. The results highlight the adaptability of established growth facilities for producing atomically thin to multilayered 2D semiconductor materials, paving the way for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dissociative Adsorption of O2 on Ag3Au(111) Surface: A Density Functional Theory Study</title>

                The catalytic efficiency of oxygen reduction catalysts is notably influenced by the dissociative adsorption of O2. We conducted a systematic investigation into the dissociative adsorption of O2 on the Ag3Au(111) surface using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our computational findings indicate that adsorption the configuration designated t-b-t exhibits favorable energetics on the Ag3Au(111) surface. Regarding the dissociation of O2, we identified a reasonable dissociation pathway, which proceeds from the initial t-b-t state to the creation of two oxygen atoms that occupy a set of neighboring fcc sites. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the adsorption of O2 on the Ag3Au(111) surface is less favored thermodynamically and more difficult to dissociate than that on the Ag(111) surface. This study furnishes a theoretical framework elucidating the prospective utilization of Ag-Au alloy in the capacity of oxygen reduction catalysts.</description>

                Driven by the continuous search for materials with antibacterial and anticancer applications, this study focuses on the fabrication of nanocomposite films using chitosan as the basis material, with the addition of gadolinium oxide nanoparticles at varying weight percentages (5 and 10 wt.% Gd 2 O 3 /CS). The films were made using the coprecipitation&#8208;solution cast approach. The structural characteristics of the Gd 2 O 3 /CS films that were formed were investigated and confirmed using a range of analytical techniques, including Fourier transform infrared, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy&#8211;energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. The X&#8208;ray diffraction study provided unambiguous evidence of an increased degree of crystallinity in chitosan with the inclusion of gadolinia. The particle size was determined using the Debye&#8211;Scherrer formula, resulting in an estimated value of 36 nm. Following this, a thorough examination was undertaken to evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness against one strain of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and two strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Our research has revealed that the efficacy of the inspected Gd 2 O 3 /CS as bactericides is superior to that of CS alone. Furthermore, the MCF&#8208;7, HCT&#8208;116, and HepG&#8208;2 cell lines exhibited anticancer activity when exposed to the Gd 2 O 3 /CS nanocomposites. In addition, nanocomposites exhibit significant antioxidant activity in comparison with the conventional vitamin C. These findings provide evidence for the viability of our nanocomposites in combating breast cancer.</description>

      <title>Coverage, repulsion, and reactivity of hydrogen on High-Entropy alloys</title>

                Modeling hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity probability on IrPdPtRhRu(1 1 1) high-entropy alloys. Determining hydrogen coverages based on ligand effects and generalized hydrogen&#8211;hydrogen repulsion. The rate of H2 formation is highly impacted by the level of hydrogen coverage on the catalyst surface. In search of optimal catalytic properties high-entropy alloys (HEA) are promising candidates that utilize the compositional space of multiple elements. Based on simulations of HEA model (1 1 1) surfaces with a range of hydrogen coverages, distributions of binding energies are used to construct a framework that approximates the probability that adsorbed hydrogen may lead to the formation of H2 as a function of applied potential. By optimizing the alloy compositions for the highest activity probability at given potentials the best and most efficient catalyst candidates for HER can be identified. Treating hydrogen&#8211;hydrogen repulsion effects and binding energy separately, we find that the repulsion is larger for HEAs than for pure metals. Differing isotherm slopes in the mean adsorption and desorption energies demonstrate a possible hysteresis for hydrogen adsorption on HEAs.</description>

                Abstract Alternative strategies to design sustainable&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalysts enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are demanded to develop affordable yet high&#8208;performance water&#8208;electrolyzers for green hydrogen production. Here, it is demonstrated that the spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated framework comprising abundant elements of nickel and iron with a ratio of Ni:Fe = 1:4 with benzenehexathiol linker (BHT) can improve OER kinetics by its unique electronic property. Among the bimetallic NiFe x:y &#8208;BHTs with various ratios with Ni:Fe = x:y, the NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT exhibits the highest OER activity. The NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT shows a specific current density of 140 A g &#8722;1 at the overpotential of 350 mV. This performance is one of the best activities among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;precious OER electrocatalysts and even comparable to that of the platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals of RuO 2 and IrO 2 . The density functional theory calculations uncover that introducing Ni into the homometallic Fe&#8208;BHT (e.g., Ni:Fe = 0:1) can emerge a spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized state. Thus, this material can achieve improved OER kinetics with spin&#8208;polarization which previously required external magnetic fields. This work shows that a rational design of 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated frameworks can be a powerful strategy to synthesize promising electrocatalysts with abundant elements for a wide spectrum of next&#8208;generation energy devices.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;emle-engine&lt;/i&gt;: A Flexible Electrostatic Machine Learning Embedding Package for Multiscale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>Kirill Zinovjev, Lester O. Hedges, Rub&#233;n Montagud Andreu, Christopher Woods, I&#241;aki Tu&#241;&#243;n, Marc W. van der Kamp, Journal of chemical theory and computation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399091017

                We present in this work the emle-engine package (https://github.com/chemle/emle-engine)&#9472;the implementation of a new machine learning embedding scheme for hybrid machine learning potential/molecular-mechanics (ML/MM) dynamics simulations. The package is based on an embedding scheme that uses a physics-based model of the electronic density and induction with a handful of tunable parameters derived from in vacuo properties of the subsystem to be embedded. This scheme is completely independent of the in vacuo potential and requires only the positions of the atoms of the machine learning subsystem and the positions and partial charges of the molecular mechanics environment. These characteristics allow emle-engine to be employed in existing QM/MM software. We demonstrate that the implemented electrostatic machine learning embedding scheme (named EMLE) is stable in enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Through the calculation of free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide in water with two different ML options for the in vacuo potential and three embedding models, we test the performance of EMLE. When compared to the reference DFT/MM surface, the EMLE embedding is clearly superior to the MM one based on fixed partial charges. The configurational dependence of the electronic density and the inclusion of the induction energy introduced by the EMLE model leads to a systematic reduction in the average error of the free energy surface when compared to MM embedding. By enabling the usage of EMLE embedding in practical ML/MM simulations, emle-engine will make it possible to accurately model systems and processes that feature significant variations in the charge distribution of the ML subsystem and/or the interacting environment.</description>

      <title>Predictive Synthesis of Transition Metal Carbide via Thermochemical Oxocarbon Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c03820</link>

                Fabricating nanoscale metal carbides is a great challenge due to them having higher Gibbs free energy of formation (&#916;G&#176;) values than other metal compounds; additionally, these carbides have harsh calcination conditions, in which metal oxidation is preferred in the atmosphere. Herein, we report oxocarbon-mediated calcination for the predictive synthesis of nanoscale metal carbides. The thermochemical oxocarbon equilibrium of CO&#8211;CO2 reactions was utilized to control the selective redox reactions in multiatomic systems of Mo&#8211;C&#8211;O, contributing to the phase-forming and structuring of Mo compounds. By harnessing the thermodynamically predicted processing window, we controlled a wide range of Mo phases (MoO2, &#945;-MoC1&#8211;x, and &#946;-Mo2C) and nanostructures (nanoparticle, spike, stain, and core/shell) in the Mo compounds/C nanofibers. By inducing simultaneous reactions of C&#8211;O (selective C combustion) and Mo&#8211;C (Mo carbide formation) in the nanofibers, Mo diffusion was controlled in C nanofibers, acting as a template for the nucleation and growth of Mo carbides and resulting in precise control of the phases and structures of Mo compounds. The formation mechanism of nanostructured Mo carbides was elucidated according to the CO fractions of CO&#8211;CO2 calcination. Moreover, tungsten (W) and niobium (Nb) carbides/C nanofibers have been successfully synthesized by CO&#8211;CO2 calcination. We constructed the thermodynamic map for the predictive synthesis of transition metal carbides to provide universal guideline via thermochemical oxocarbon equilibrium. We revealed that our thermochemical oxocarbon-mediated gas&#8211;solid reaction enabled the structure and phase control of nanoscale transition metal compounds to optimize the material&#8211;property relationship accordingly.</description>

      <description>Isidre Mas Magre, Rogeli Grima Torres, Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a, Jos&#233; Julio Guti&#233;rrez Moreno, Open research Europe. 4(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399124316

                This article introduces a suite of mini-applications (mini-apps) designed to optimise computational kernels in ab initio electronic structure codes. The suite is developed from flagship applications participating in the NOMAD Center of Excellence, such as the ELPA eigensolver library and the GW implementations of the exciting, Abinit, and FHI-aims codes. The mini-apps were identified by targeting functions that significantly contribute to the total execution time in the parent applications. This strategic selection allows for concentrated optimisation efforts. The suite is designed for easy deployment on various High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, supported by an integrated CMake build system for straightforward compilation and execution. The aim is to harness the capabilities of emerging (post)exascale systems, which necessitate concurrent hardware and software development &#8212; a concept known as co-design. The mini-app suite serves as a tool for profiling and benchmarking, providing insights that can guide both software optimisation and hardware design. Ultimately, these developments will enable more accurate and efficient simulations of novel materials, leveraging the full potential of exascale computing in material science research.</description>

      <title>Design of Multifunctional Electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER/HOR: Janus Makes Difference</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404000</link>
      <description>Xinyu Yang, Long Lin, Xiangyu Guo, Shengli Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399140360

                Abstract Multifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have broad application prospects; However, realization of such kinds of materials remain difficulties because it requires the materials to have not only unique electronic properties, but multiple active centers to deal with different reactions. Here, employing density functional theory (DFT) computations, it is demonstrated that by decorating the Janus&#8208;type 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) of TaSSe with the single atoms, the materials can achieve multifunctionality to catalyze the ORR/OER/HER/HOR. Out of sixteen catalytic systems, Pt&#8208;V S (i.e., Pt atom embedded in the sulfur vacancy), Pd&#8208;V Se , and Pt&#8208;V Se @TaSSe are promising multifunctional catalysts with superior stability. Among them, the Pt&#8208;V S @TaSSe catalyst exhibits the highest activity with theoretical overpotentials &#951; ORR = 0.40 V, &#951; OER = 0.39 V, and &#951; HER/HOR = 0.07 V, respectively, better than the traditional Pt (111), IrO 2 (110). The interplays between the catalyst and the reaction intermediate over the course of the reaction are then systematically investigated. Generally, this study presents a viable approach for the design and development of advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts. It enriches the application of Janus, a new 2D material, in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technology.</description>

      <title>There is no escape: How insertion of a single Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom into lattice of &#946;-molybdenum carbide affects its fundamental properties and catalytic activity</title>

                Impact of insertion of a single Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom into crystalline lattice of orthorhombic Mo2C(001) surface on fundamental properties of the surface atoms has been investigated by means of density functional theory. Polar C- and Mo-terminated surfaces were used as model systems and two modes of the foreign atom insertion were considered: into the topmost Mo layer of the surface and into metal layer deeper in the structure of the host system. Calculations revealed that TM-modified Mo2C compounds were less stable than the pristine carbide with no significant changes in work function of the carbide surface, regardless of its termination, foreign atom nature, and its position in the host system. Furthermore, presence of either Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom in subsurface or in the topmost metal layer of the terminations did not impact noticeably electronic structure of either C or Mo atoms closest to the modification site as evidenced from analysis of their density of states. Consequentially, insertion of foreign atoms into the lattice of molybdenum carbide results in atomic hydrogen stability close to that on the corresponding unmodified polar termination of the Mo2C(001) surface. In the context of experimentally observed changes in catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide toward hydrogen evolution reaction upon doping it with transition metals, the obtained data evidence that the major effect comes from the foreign atoms being adsorbed on molybdenum carbide surface, while insertion into the lattice bears no significant impact. This suggests that coating Mo2C surface with transition metals can be promising strategy to modify and tailor its catalytic properties for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical studies of WO3/Vulcan XC-72 electrocatalyst enhanced H2O2 yield ORR performed in acid and alkaline medium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.113182</link>

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a pivotal role in clean energy generation and sustainable chemical production, particularly in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study, WO3/Vulcan-XC72 electrocatalysts have been synthesized and characterized for ORR applications. We assessed the ratio of WO3 to Vulcan-XC72 and investigated the impact of electrolytes pH (covering acidic and alkaline media) on the ORR process. The results revealed that WO3 with a monoclinic crystalline phase and nanoflower-like morphology was successfully synthesized, and confirmed an improvement in surface properties, with an increase in hydrophilicity and superficial oxygenated species. Electrochemical studies showed that WO3/C was the most selective for H2O2 electrogeneration, compared to pure Vulcan-XC72, in both acidic and alkaline media. These results indicate that the ORR on the WO3/C electrocatalyst surface has a pH-dependent mechanism. Using WO3/C GDEs, an accumulation of 862 mg L-1 of H2O2 was achieved after 120 min of electrolysis at 100 mA cm-2. The higher selectivity of WO3/C could be related to the presence of more oxygen functional acid species on the catalyst surface and increased hydrophilicity compared to pure Vulcan, as well as a synergistic effect of the WO3 nanoflowers in ORR, confirmed by theoretical calculations. The results reveal that WO3/Vulcan is a promising catalyst for H2O2 electrogeneration via the ORR.</description>

                Perovskite oxides are gaining significant attention for use in next-generation magnetic and ferroelectric devices due to their exceptional charge transport properties and the opportunity to tune the charge, spin, lattice, and orbital degrees of freedom. Interfaces between perovskite oxides, exemplified by La1&#8211;xSrxCoO3&#8722;&#948;/La1&#8211;xSrxMnO3&#8722;&#948; (LSCO/LSMO) bilayers, exhibit unconventional magnetic exchange switching behavior, offering a pathway for innovative designs in perovskite oxide-based devices. However, the precise atomic-level stoichiometric compositions and chemophysical properties of these interfaces remain elusive, hindering the establishment of surrogate design principles. We leverage first-principles simulations, evolutionary algorithms, and neural network searches with on-the-fly uncertainty quantification to design deep learning model ensembles to investigate over 50,000 LSCO/LSMO bilayer structures as a function of oxygen deficiency (&#948;) and strontium concentration (x). Structural analysis of the low-energy interface structures reveals that preferential segregation of oxygen vacancies toward the interfacial La0.7Sr0.3CoO3&#8722;&#948; layers causes distortion of the CoOx polyhedra and the emergence of magnetically active Co2+ ions. At the same time, an increase in the Sr concentration and a decrease in oxygen vacancies in the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3&#8722;&#948; layers tend to retain MnO6 octahedra and promote the formation of Mn4+ ions. Electronic structure analysis reveals that the nonuniform distributions of Sr ions and oxygen vacancies on both sides of the interface can alter the local magnetization at the interface, showing a transition from ferromagnetic (FM) to local antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic regions. Therefore, the exotic properties of La1&#8211;xSrxCoO3&#8722;&#948;/La1&#8211;xSrxMnO3&#8722;&#948; are strongly coupled to the presence of hard/soft magnetic layers, as well as the FM to AFM transition at the interface, and can be tuned by changing the Sr concentration and oxygen partial pressure during growth. These insights provide valuable guidance for the precise design of perovskite oxide multilayers, enabling tailoring of their functional properties to meet specific requirements for various device applications.</description>

                Abstract DFT functionals are of paramount importance for an accurate electronic and structural description of transition metal systems. In this work, a systematic analysis using some well&#8208;known and commonly used DFT functionals is performed. A comparison of the structural and energetic parameters calculated with the available experimental data is made in order to find the adequate functional for an accurate description of the TiO 2 bulk and surface of both anatase and rutile structures. In the absence of experimental data on the surface energy, the theoretical predictions obtained using the high&#8208;accuracy HSE06 functional were used as a reference to compare against the surface energy values calculated with the other DFT functionals. A clear improvement in the electronic description of both anatase and rutile was observed by introducing the Hubbard U correction term to PBE, PW91, and OptPBE functionals. The OptPBE&#8208; U 4 functional was found to offer a good compromise between accurately describing the structural and electronic properties of titania.</description>

                Abstract 2D semiconductor nanomaterials have received significant attention as photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion due to their robust light absorption capacity, large specific surface area, and superior electron transport characteristics. Nevertheless, it is challenging to develop 2D quaternary copper&#8208;based sulfides (QCSs) with functional integration of conducive structural features for photocatalysis from multiple elements and intricate control conditions. Herein, ultrathin 2D alloyed Cu&#8722;Ga&#8722;Zn&#8722;S (CGZS) curved nanobelts (NBs) are fabricated by using a facile one&#8208;pot colloidal method. Subsequently, the derived Cu 31 S 16 &#8208;CGZS Janus heterostructures are designed by increasing Cu concentrations. The formation mechanism of 2D curved alloys and Janus heterostructures is systematically investigated. Without cocatalysts, curved alloyed CGZS NBs demonstrated superior photocatalytic activities of 1264.2 &#181;mol g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 compared to Janus heterostructured Cu 31 S 16 &#8722;CGZS (463.1 &#181;mol g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 ) under visible light (&gt; 400 nm). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the improved photocatalytic activities of curved CGZS NBs can be attributed to enhanced charge&#8211;carrier separation efficiency resulting from high crystallinity and ultrathin 2D structure, abundant active sites from curved structure, high&#8208;active (0001) crystal facet with the lowest reaction Gibbs energy, work function, and metal&#8208;like properties. This work offers new insights into functional integration into ultrathin 2D QCSs with enhanced visible&#8208;light photocatalytic performance.</description>

                The recent synthesis of a two-dimensional (2D) MBene sheet, referred to as the boridene sheet (Mo4B6Tz), has ignited considerable interest in exploring 2D transition metal borides. Boridene has an ordered arrangement of metal vacancies, which are pivotal to its stability. Employing first-principles calculations, we explored the stable phases, electronic properties and catalytic abilities of boridene with different vacancy concentrations (Vm). Our results demonstrate that Vm significantly influences the cohesive energies of boridene sheets. Phonon spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the high stability of the vacancy-free boridene Mo6B6T6 (T = O, -OH), underscoring their potential for experimental realization. Substituting Mo atoms with Nb, Ta, or W enhances the structural stability of boridene sheets, leading to the identification of four stable variants: Nb6B6F6, Ta6B6F6, Ta6B6O6, and W6B6O6. These boridene sheets exhibit metallic behavior, with five structures displaying near-zero Gibbs free energy for hydrogen atom adsorption, indicating their potential as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The uncovering of vacancy-free boridenes and their 2D derivatives greatly broadens the scope of the MBene family.</description>
