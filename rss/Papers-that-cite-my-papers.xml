      <title>Theoretical and Experimental Studies of the Structural Chameleon EuYCuTe3</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma18040820</link>
      <description>&#1040;nna V. Ruseikina, Maxim V. Grigoriev, V. A. Chernyshev, E. M. Roginski&#301;, Alexander A. Garmonov, Ralf J. C. Locke, Thomas Schleid, Materials. 18(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407531841

                Layered orthorhombic single crystals of EuYCuTe3 are synthesized using the ampoule method from the elemental precursors taken in the ratio of 1 Eu:1 Y:1 Cu:3 Te by heating up to 1120 K with an excess of CsI as flux. The orthorhombic structure of EuYCuTe3 is established, and structural parameters are obtained using X-ray diffraction. At ambient conditions, the sample crystallizes in the space group Pnma with the unit cell parameters a = 11.2730(7) &#197;, b = 4.3214(3) &#197;, c = 14.3271(9) &#197;. The structure is composed of vertex-connected [CuTe4]7&#8722; tetrahedra, which form chains along the [010] direction, and of edge-connected [YTe6]9&#8722; octahedra, which form layers parallel to the (010) plane. The Eu2+ cations are found in a capped trigonal prismatic coordination of Te2&#8722; anions. The structural phase transition from the &#945; to the &#946; phase is discovered upon heating the sample to 323 K, which comes accompanied with a decrease of [CuTe4]7&#8722; tetrahedral distortion. The symmetry of the high-temperature phase is established as ordered in the space group Cmcm (a = 4.3231(3) &#197;, b = 14.3328(9) &#197;, c = 11.2843(7) &#197;). The nature and microscopic mechanism of the phase transition is discussed. By cooling it down below 3 K, the soft ferromagnetic properties of EuYCuTe3 are discovered. The correlation of the ferromagnetic transition temperature in the series of chalcogenides EuYCuCh3 (Ch = S, Se, Te) with the ionic radius of the chalcogenide anion is established. The structural dynamical elastic properties of &#945;- and &#946;-EuYCuTe3 were calculated within the ab initio approach. The vibrational mode frequencies and decomposition on irreducible representations, as well as the degree of ion involvement in each mode, were determined. The calculations reveal an imaginary mode in the Y-point of the Brillouin zone in the high symmetry &#946;-EuYCuTe3 phase. This finding explains the nature of structural reconstruction in EuYCuTe3 crystal as a second-order phase transition induced by soft mode condensation at the edge of the Brillouin zone. The exfoliation of a single layer is simulated theoretically. The exfoliation energy is estimated, and the dynamical properties of EuYCuTe3 single layers are studied.</description>

      <title>Dual Doping in Precious Metal Oxides: Accelerating Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26041582</link>

                Developing a highly active and stable catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), the key half-reaction for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, has been one of the most cutting-edge topics in electrocatalysis. A dual-doping strategy optimizes the catalyst electronic environment, modifies the coordination environment, generates vacancies, and introduces strain effects through the synergistic effect of two elements to achieve high catalytic performance. In this review, we summarize the progress of dual doping in RuO2 or IrO2 for acidic OERs. The three main mechanisms of OERs are dicussed firstly, followed by a detailed examination of the development history of dual-doping catalysts, from experimentally driven dual-doping systems to machine learning (ML) and theoretical screening of dual-doping systems. Lastly, we provide a summary of the remaining challenges and future prospects, offering valuable insights into dual doping for acidic OERs.</description>

      <title>Design of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo@&#947;-GDY triatomic catalyst for electrocatalytic urea synthesis of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO: a theoretical study</title>

                While urea is widely used as a chemical raw material, its precursor ammonia (NH3) has traditionally been synthesized under high-temperature/pressure conditions, leading to not only huge energy consumption but also serious CO2 emission. Here, we present a groundbreaking catalyst design approach, which optimizes adsorption configurations and reaction pathways by controlling the adsorption energies of each intermediate in the reaction, thus enhancing catalytic performance. Via density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a triatomic catalyst [i.e., Fe2Mo@&#947;-graphdiyne (&#947;-GDY)] with a limiting potential of -0.22 V and a C-N coupling energy barrier of 0.34 eV. Notably, the Fe2Mo@&#947;-GDY catalyst presents a high selectivity and robust antioxidation capabilities under applied potentials. Our comprehensive analysis elucidates the factors affecting the limiting potential and C-N coupling energy barrier. These insights significantly contribute to the advancement of catalyst design strategies for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, offering a more efficient and eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods.</description>

                Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are very often used to make predictions for datasets that were created externally in arbitrary experiments or on already literature known datasets. In this work, we try to make use of active learning techniques to search for an optimal strategy for the startup&#8208;phase of bulk nickel electrodes in the oxygen evolution reaction. The data collected was afterwards reduced in dimensions and used to extract additional information that were learned via an artificial neural network (ANN) on the dataset, respectively.</description>

                Electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) produced from recyclable resources has recently gained increasing attention due to the scarcity of high-quality manganese natural resources and its broad range of applications. This review has summarised recent progress in manganese recovery techniques, including pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. It has also critically assessed the processes and mechanisms involved in manganese electrodeposition for the Mn chloride- and Mn sulphate-based systems, with a major focus on electrode reactions and Mn nucleation growth. The key optimisation factors influencing manganese electrodeposition, such as electrolytes, power consumption, additives, cell structures, and electrode materials, were analysed, with particular attention to their impact on current efficiency, specific energy consumption, and product quality. The recent research directions were also highlighted to address practical challenges and enhance the sustainability of the EMM process, which mainly includes improving the ecological outcomes and reducing both the operating and investment costs. Promising strategies for the simultaneous production of EMM and electrolytic manganese dioxide (EMD) were also identified, which mainly comprised applying membrane technology, electrodeposition from ionic liquids, recycling and reusing waste materials, and exploring hybrid techniques. The results of this study showed that the prospective optimisation approaches for EMM are mainly driven by the need to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product quality through sustainable technological advancements. This review can be used as a comprehensive guide for manganese electrodeposition approaches for both practical and scientific research communities.</description>

      <title>Proton Relay in Hydrogen-Bond Networks Promotes Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c00318</link>

                Common O-/H-down orientation of H2O molecules on electrocatalysts brings favorable OH/H delivery; however, adverse H/OH delivery in their dissociation process hampers the H2O dissociation kinetics of the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To overcome this challenge, we raised a synergetic H2O dissociation concept of metal-supported electrocatalysts involving efficient OH delivery from O-down H2O to the metal, timely proton relay from O-down H2O on the metal to H-down H2O on the support through the hydrogen-bond network, and prompt H delivery from H-down H2O to the support. After theoretically profiling that a high work function difference between the metal and the support (&#916;&#934;) induces a strong electric field at the metal&#8211;support interface that increases hydrogen-bond connectivity to promote proton relay, we practiced this concept over cobalt phosphide-supported ruthenium (Ru/CoP) catalysts with a high &#916;&#934; = 0.4 eV, achieving a record-high Ru utilization HER activity of 66.1 A mgRu&#8211;1 at &#8722;0.1 V vs RHE. The insights into this synergetic H2O dissociation mechanism provide opportunity for the design of bicomponent alkaline HER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Independent Tuning of Intermediate Energetics for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution via Synergistic Defects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202417098</link>
      <description>Ding Yuan, Xiaoyi Dou, Qing Zhang, Chun&#8208;Ting He, Chao Wu, Yang Li, Weijie Li, Linping Yu, Lei Zhang, Huan Liu, Shi Xue Dou, Ji Liang, Yuhai Dou, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407584253

                Abstract Electronic structure engineering via integrating different defects is the key to achieving independent tuning of intermediate energetics for efficient electrocatalyst design. Such a combination of defects is at the forefront of current research. Herein, W is etched from Co(OH) 2 to generate Co vacancies, which are then partially filled with La to form Co(OH) 2 &#8208;Co V &#8208;La D for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results show that Co vacancy and La dopant induce more high&#8208;valence Co species under OER conditions and the most active center is a surface Co site that is adjacent to a surface Co vacancy and a subsurface La dopant on different sides, where the optimized electronic structure narrows the gap between Gibbs free energies of OH* (&#916;G OH* ) and OOH* (&#916;G OOH* ) and modifies &#916;G O* close to the midpoint, leading to high catalytic activity. The integration of synergistic defects offers an effective strategy to generate a range of defect atomic configurations and diverse electronic states, which enable the independent tuning of intermediate energetics, thereby unlocking the catalyst's full catalytic potential.</description>

                It is of great importance to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts with high efficiency and low cost for water splitting and fuel cells. Herein, based on the new emerging two-dimensional material of MoSi2N4, we explore the potentials of novel Janus MoSi2P2As2 (labeled as MSPA) in electrocatalytic applications. We conduct a comprehensive study using first-principles calculations to explore the potential of Janus MoSi2P2As2 decorated with 13 kinds of transition metal atoms as efficient bifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) and oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR). After screening, results show that Rh@MSPA and Au@MSPA can serve as bifunctional catalysts for OER/ORR with overpotentials of 0.27/0.29 V and 0.42/0.37 V, and Pt@MSPA exhibit great potential as HER/OER catalyst with an overpotential of -0.004/0.51 V. The solvation effect on catalytic activity is also investigated. The volcano diagrams are employed to depict the activity trends toward HER, OER, and ORR. The d-band center, ICOHP and intrinsic descriptor &#966; can serve as quantitative descriptors of ORR/OER activity and reveal the activity origin of OER/ORR. This study presents a viable approach for developing advanced electrocatalysts with multiple functionalities, thereby expanding the utilization of Janus MoSi2P2As2 in electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Outlier-detection for reactive machine learned potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01473-6</link>
      <description>Luis Itza Vazquez-Salazar, Silvan K&#228;ser, Markus Meuwly, npj Computational Materials. 11(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407602147

                Abstract Uncertainty quantification (UQ) to detect samples with large expected errors (outliers) is applied to reactive molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs). Three methods&#8211;Ensembles, deep evidential regression (DER), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)&#8212;were applied to the H-transfer reaction between syn -Criegee and vinyl hydroxyperoxide. The results indicate that ensemble models provide the best results for detecting outliers, followed by GMM. For example, from a pool of 1000 structures with the largest uncertainty, the detection quality for outliers is ~90% and ~50%, respectively, if 25 or 1000 structures with large errors are sought. On the contrary, the limitations of the statistical assumptions of DER greatly impact its prediction capabilities. Finally, a structure-based indicator was found to be correlated with large average error, which may help to rapidly classify new structures into those that provide an advantage for refining the neural network.</description>

                The sluggish kinetics of oxygen&#8208;involved electrolysis, such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hinders the efficiency of the pertaining energy conversion process, which can be promoted by using spin&#8208;selective materials to align the spin direction of oxygen&#8208;involved intermediates. This review delivers a thorough and timely overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spin&#8208;selective catalysts for OER and ORR. Primarily, the fundamental principle of spin&#8208;selective process is depicted by the spin&#8208;sensitive reaction pathways, pointing out that the existence of spin&#8208;polarized adsorption sites is necessary for the development of spin&#8208;selective catalysts. Subsequently, approaches for investigating the spin&#8208;related transition during electrocatalysis are introduced by reviewing in situ technologies and theoretical calculations. Then, the reported spin&#8208;selective catalysts are categorized into intrinsic spin&#8208;polarized materials, doping&#8208;induced spin&#8208;polarized materials, and multiple magnetic composites to discuss their application in electrocatalytic OER and ORR as well as their mechanism of spin polarization. Finally, the open questions and prospects in this field are concluded, aiming to offer a clear route for designing novel and highly&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;polarized materials for industrial oxygen&#8208;involved electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Direct formic acid fuel cells are promising energy devices with advantages of low working temperature and high safety in fuel storage and transport. They have been expected to be a future power source for portable electronic devices. The technology has been developed rapidly to overcome the high cost and low power performance that hinder its practical application, which mainly originated from the slow reaction kinetics of the formic acid oxidation and complex mass transfer within the fuel cell electrodes. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the progress around this technology, in particular for addressing multiscale challenges from catalytic mechanism understanding at the atomic scale, to catalyst design at the nanoscale, electrode structure at the micro scale and design at the millimeter scale, and finally to device fabrication at the meter scale. The gap between the highly active electrocatalysts and the poor electrode performance in practical devices is highlighted. Finally, perspectives and opportunities are proposed to potentially bridge this gap for further development of this technology.</description>

      <title>Recombination of Autodissociated Water Ions in a Nanoscale Pure Water Droplet</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c15103</link>
      <description>Soonho Kwon, Prabhat Prakash, Yixiang Cao, Frances A. Houle, William A. Goddard, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407624611

                The recombination of water ions has diverse scientific and practical implications, ranging from acid&#8211;base chemistry and biological systems to planetary environments and applications in fuel cell and carbon conversion technologies. While spatial confinement affects the physicochemical properties of water dynamics, its impact on the recombination process has rarely been studied. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of water, the water ion distribution, and the ion recombination process in water droplets as a function of droplet size through molecular dynamics simulations and adaptive quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations. We compare the dynamics of recombination in water droplet sizes ranging from 100 to 18 000 waters, both in their interiors and on their surfaces. We found that the self-diffusion of water dramatically decreases in droplets with a diameter below 2.2 nm. Using a classical RexPoN force-field, we found that the ions in 1000 H2O's spend almost 50% of the time on the surface and 0.5 nm beneath it with a slight preference for OH&#8211; ion to reside longer on the surface. We estimate that, on average, recombination in these drops occurs at 400 ps in 1000 H2O's and 1 ns in 3000 H2O's. We also found that recombination is not limited by the local structure of the surface or the size of the droplet but can be influenced by the geometry of the water wire connecting the ions as they approach each other, which can often prevent recombination. Our results provide insights to the reaction microenvironments presented by nanoscopic water droplets.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically Driven Optical Dynamics of Reflectin Protein Films</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202411005</link>
      <description>Yin&#8208;Chen Lin, Changxuan Yang, Seren Tochikura, Joshua R. Uzarski, Daniel E. Morse, Lior Sepunaru, Michael J. Gordon, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407637890

                Abstract Neuronally triggered phosphorylation drives the dynamic condensation of reflectin proteins, enabling squid to fine tune the colors reflected from specialized skin cells (iridocytes) for camouflage and communication. Reflectin, the primary component of iridocyte lamellae, forms alternating layers of protein and low refractive index extracellular space within membrane&#8208;encapsulated structures, acting as a biologically tunable distributed Bragg reflector. In vivo, reflectin condensation induces osmotic dehydration of these lamellae, reducing their thickness and shifting the wavelength of reflected light. Inspired by this natural mechanism, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of imidazolium moieties within the protein provides a reversible and tunable method to control the water volume fraction in reflectin thin films, allowing precise, dynamic modulation of the film&#8217;s refractive index and thickness &#8212; mimicking the squid&#8217;s dynamic color adaptation. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enabling real&#8208;time analysis of optical property changes of reflectin films. This electrochemically driven approach offers unprecedented control over reflectin condensation dynamics. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of biophysical processes governing cephalopod coloration but also pave the way for bio&#8208;inspired materials and devices that seamlessly integrate biological principles with synthetic systems to bridge the biotic&#8208;abiotic gap.</description>

      <description>Haoyu Wan, Yue Wu, Guanhua Qin, Deng Pan, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407639677

                This study investigates the formation and stability of passivation films in medium-entropy CrCoNi alloy using an integrated approach combining first-principles calculations and Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP). By performing extensive structural relaxations coupled with random occupancy of the alloy and multiple potential adsorption sites, the results based on surface reconstruction are analyzed. Our results demonstrate that disordered atomic structures in medium entropy CrCoNi alloy exhibit improved oxide film stability compared to ordered structures, with lower system energies correlating with more robust passivation layers. Furthermore, by constructing physically meaningful descriptors and employing symbolic regression in complex surface environments, simple yet highly correlated rules are obtained, providing insights into the passivation strengthening of CrCoNi alloy from both global and local perspectives. Our work paves the way for exploring surface regularities in complex medium-entropy alloys with the combination of quantum mechanical accuracy and machine learning efficiency.</description>

                Abstract The design of efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the development of green hydrogen production. In this work, we report modulation the HER activity of Ru nanoparticles by functionalization using para&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes (R = Cl, H, C 2 H 5 , and OCH 3 ), which have different electron donating/withdrawing capabilities. A close correlation between the Hammett substituent constant of the phenylacetylenes and HER activity of the functionalized Ru nanoparticles is revealed, and the underlying mechanism is investigated. Guided by such correlation, 4&#8208;ethylphenylacetylene&#8208;modified Ru nanoparticles (Ru&#9472;EPA) with a low HER overpotential of 17.7 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline solution is developed. The mechanistic understanding gained in this work will provide important guidelines for future development of high&#8208;performance nanostructured electrocatalyst.</description>

                Neutrons, owing to their unique properties, serve as indispensable probes for investigating the structure and dynamics of materials across various length scales. The scientific community utilizing neutron research infrastructures encompasses a diverse range of disciplines, making it challenging to quantify its scientific and societal impact. To address this challenge, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the scientific output of the European neutron science community. Leveraging open-source software toolkits, our method allows for the quantitative assessment of community evolution and research focus. Our analysis reveals consistent growth in the neutron community despite a reduction in sources, underscoring the enduring significance of neutron methods in scientific research. Furthermore, an increase in unique authors and an even distribution of publications across diverse scientific topics highlight the community's interdisciplinary nature and collaborative spirit. While this study emphasizes neutron scattering, our methodology holds promise for a broad range of scientific communities reliant on Large Research Infrastructures (LRIs), offering opportunities for collaboration, optimization of experimental approaches, and informed decision-making by governmental and funding bodies.</description>

                Abstract This study introduces a pioneering application of triiodide ionic liquids (ILs) for the efficient and sustainable recovery of gold (Au) from real&#8208;world, various types of electronic wastes. Our method significantly reduces both environmental impact and reagent expenses, while operating under mild conditions. This technique is ideal for practical applications given its ultra&#8208;fast leaching (5 min) and room temperature (35&#176;C) reaction conditions, leading to an unprecedented 11&#8208;fold enhancement in the reaction kinetics relative to aqua regia. Notably, more than 99.3% of Au from e&#8208;waste can be selectively dissolved while excluding non&#8208;target elements like Cu. Compared with conventional dissolution&#8208;extraction processes, our method facilitates the process into a single step. Additionally, the triiodide ILs can be reused for up to six cycles, and have an impressive economic output&#8211;input ratio of 1969%, which demonstrates promising technoeconomic feasibility. This approach provides a valuable strategy for profit&#8208;efficient management of e&#8208;waste, promoting a circular economy.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction using renewable energy provides a sustainable solution to mitigate greenhouse effects and achieve carbon neutrality. Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is key to promoting such a technology. Herein, we systematically explored the CO2RR catalytic activity of 325 dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Among them, the Sc/Tc DMSC is particularly advantageous for HCOOH, CH4, and CH3CH2OH production, with limiting potentials of &#8722;0.45 V, &#8722;0.45 V, and &#8722;0.46 V, respectively. The Ti/Rh DMSC can selectively convert CO2 to CH3CH2OH at ultralow overpotentials (UL = &#8722;0.21 V). HCOOH is the preferred product of the CO2RR on the Mn/Fe site with a UL of &#8722;0.30 V. Mn/Fe presents the highest inhibitory effects on the side reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a UL of &#8722;0.66 V. Moreover, electronic analysis was conducted to further explain the enhancement for the CO2RR of explored catalysts at the subatomic level. Our work offers a strategy for screening of high-performance DMSCs and reveals the mechanisms of the CO2RR to target products for selected catalysts, benefiting the further development of CO2RR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evaluation of nitrate reduction reaction on single&#8208;atom anchored boron nitride fullerene</title>

                Abstract Nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) is a powerful technique for eliminating pollution. Here, NO 3 RRs on transition metal&#8208;doped boron nitride fullerene (TM/B 11 N 12 ) were thoroughly examined utilizing density functional theory (DFT). Co/B 11 N 12 , a potential single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) with a low thermal barrier for NO 3 RR toward NH 3 synthesis with good stability, activity, and selectivity, was successfully screened out. Co/B 11 N 12 has the lowest limiting potential ( U L ) of &#8722;0.45 V and good NO 3 RR performance. Due to the comparatively restrained adsorption of proton on Co/B 11 N 12 , competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is substantially limited. The excellent selectivity for the production of NH 3 is ensured by significant energy barrier prerequisite for the formation of by&#8208;products (NO, NO 2 , N 2 O, and N 2 ) on Co/B 11 N 12 . By ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, Co/B 11 N 12 exhibits remarkable structural stability at 400 K with minimal distortion as compared to its initial shape. Our research may not only offer a fundamental understanding of the activity origin of NO 3 RR and catalytic mechanism on TM/B 11 N 12 but also open up opportunities for rational designing of SACs for NO 3 RR toward the NH 3 synthesis.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Electron Density of Charged Systems Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c08583</link>
      <description>Sherif Abdulkader Tawfik, Sunil Gupta, Svetha Venkatesh, The Journal of Physical Chemistry A. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407451128

                The prediction of the electron density in molecules and crystals is a key pillar in the first-principles computation of their properties. Using machine learning to predict the electron density by using the atomic structure alone can save the computational cost of performing first-principles computations. While various machine learning approaches have been introduced for predicting the electron density, none of them predict the electron density for charged systems. This work extends a recent machine learning charge density model, DeepDFT, by including the charge of the structure as an input parameter into the model. We establish an input charge representation approach that successfully predicts the charged electron densities for several test cases, including charged defective perovskites, LiCoO2 supercells with multiple Li vacancies, diamond-based defects, metal-organic frameworks, and molecular crystals.</description>
