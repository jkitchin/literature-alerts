      <title>Dewetting of Pt Nanoparticles Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Due to Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202403628</link>

                Abstract Solid&#8208;state dewetting is the heat&#8208;induced agglomeration of thin metal films into defined nanoparticles (NPs). Dewetted Pt nanoparticles are investigated on F&#8208;doped SnO 2 (FTO) substrates as model binder&#8208;free electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Dewetting of Pt films into particles exposes the FTO substrate and the metal/support (Pt&#8208;FTO) contact line. Despite the decrease in Pt electrochemical surface area (ECSA) upon dewetting, dewetted NPs show a &gt;3&#8208;fold increase in ECSA&#8208;normalized HER activity compared to as&#8208;deposited nanocrystalline Pt films. Electrodes designed with dewetted Pt NPs of different sizes show that the HER activity does not only correlate with the ECSA but also increases with increasing the Pt&#8208;FTO contact line length. The smaller the NPs, the larger the Pt&#8208;FTO contact line, and the higher the activity. This effect is ascribed to electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), due to electron transfer from FTO to Pt. It is proposed that EMSI effects alter the electronic structure of Pt sites near the Pt&#8208;FTO contact line, facilitating the H 2 evolution kinetics. When NPs are a few nm&#8208;sized, a large mass fraction of Pt is affected by EMSI, resulting in a further increase of HER activity compared to NPs &#8805;10 nm despite the lower ECSA.</description>

      <title>Phase segregation and nanoconfined fluid O2 in a lithium-rich oxide cathode</title>

                Abstract Lithium-rich oxide cathodes lose energy density during cycling due to atomic disordering and nanoscale structural rearrangements, which are both challenging to characterize. Here we resolve the kinetics and thermodynamics of these processes in an exemplar layered Li-rich (Li 1.2&#8211; x Mn 0.8 O 2 ) cathode using a combined approach of ab initio molecular dynamics and cluster expansion-based Monte Carlo simulations. We identify a kinetically accessible and thermodynamically favourable mechanism to form O 2 molecules in the bulk, involving Mn migration and driven by interlayer oxygen dimerization. At the top of charge, the bulk structure locally phase segregates into MnO 2 -rich regions and Mn-deficient nanovoids, which contain O 2 molecules as a nanoconfined fluid. These nanovoids are connected in a percolating network, potentially allowing long-range oxygen transport and linking bulk O 2 formation to surface O 2 loss. These insights highlight the importance of developing strategies to kinetically stabilize the bulk structure of Li-rich O-redox cathodes to maintain their high energy densities.</description>

                Abstract Evaporation&#8208;driven electricity generators have been proposed to generate electricity by water interacting with nanostructured materials. However, several proposed mechanisms, such as intrinsic gradient of polar functional groups principle and electrokinetic effect perspective, are in wide discrepancy. Here, through the combination of theoretical calculations involving time dimension on material's moisturizing process and experimental analyses, it is revealed the working principle through the water molecule triple roles in driving moisture electric generators (MEGs): 1) intrinsic H 2 O absorption on the material surface and splitting into hydroxy group and proton due to the polarizability of the material surface determined by the static electric potential of the materials. This process induces the electrochemical potential difference of the materials via the work function changes; 2) freely diffused protons derived from the H 2 O splitting work as the ions charge carriers; 3) via the hydrogen bond of the water molecules to drive charge carriers diffuse between opposite electrodes, maintaining the internal circuit current flow. It is successfully unveiled that anatase TiO 2 based materials for output voltage changes correlated to the domains&#8217; work function's difference, tuning by the surface adsorption species (H, Cl, OH) and anisotropic exposed crystal facets of the material. This work unveils MEG's general working principle.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production (EHPP) via a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e - ORR) provides a promising alternative to replace the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. M-N-C electrocatalysts, which consist of atomically dispersed transition metals and nitrogen-doped carbon, have demonstrated considerable EHPP efficiency. However, their full potential, particularly regarding the correlation between structural configurations and performances in neutral media, remains underexplored. Herein, a series of ultralow metal-loading M-N-C electrocatalysts are synthesized and investigated for the EHPP process in the neutral electrolyte. CoNCB material with the asymmetric Co-C/N/O configuration exhibits the highest EHPP activity and selectivity among various as-prepared M-N-C electrocatalyst, with an outstanding mass activity (6.1 &#215; 10 5 A g Co &#8722;1 at 0.5 V vs. RHE), and a high practical H 2 O 2 production rate (4.72 mol g catalyst &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 cm &#8722;2 ). Compared with the popularly recognized square-planar symmetric Co-N 4 configuration, the superiority of asymmetric Co-C/N/O configurations is elucidated by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis and computational studies.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput screening of metal nitrides for electrochemical nitrogen reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.160289</link>

                Metal nitrides have garnered considerable attention in the context of nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) due to their rich lattice nitrogen and abundant nitrogen vacancies to activate N2. However, the identification of suitable metal nitrides with superior stability, activity, and selectivity (vs. hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) for electrochemical NRR under rigorous isotope labeling experiments remains a perplexing challenge in experiments. In this study, we implemented a systematic screening protocol to assess the electrochemical stability and efficiency of various metal nitrides for NRR by high-throughput density functional theory calculations, aiming to search out promising metal nitride catalysts. Through a set of predetermined criteria, a subset of 6 candidates emerges as the most promising metal nitrides for NRR from a pool of 668 metal nitrides sourced from the Materials Project Database, all of which catalyze NRR following the Mars-van Krevelen pathway. Importantly, based on the analysis of these candidates, the unique structural property (i.e., four(or three)-coordinate lattice nitrogen) and energy descriptor (i.e., the formation energy of the lattice nitrogen vacancy is around 2.1 eV) of potential metal nitrides for electrochemical NRR were extracted, which could be used as the direction to rationally design metal nitride catalyst. This research not only serves as a valuable guide for experimental investigations into potential metal nitrides for NRR, but also provides an efficient method for high-throughput screening of potential catalysts for other electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction on Metallic and Oxidized Tin Using Grand-Canonical DFT and In Situ ATR-SEIRA Spectroscopy</title>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to formate is an attractive carbon emissions mitigation strategy due to the existing market and attractive price for formic acid. Tin is an effective electrocatalyst for CO2R to formate, but the underlying reaction mechanism and whether the active phase of tin is metallic or oxidized during reduction is openly debated. In this report, we used grand-canonical density functional theory and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to identify differences in the vibrational signatures of surface species during CO2R on fully metallic and oxidized tin surfaces. Our results show that CO2R is feasible on both metallic and oxidized tin. We propose that the key difference between each surface termination is that CO2R catalyzed by metallic tin surfaces is limited by the electrochemical activation of CO2, whereas CO2R catalyzed by oxidized tin surfaces is limited by the slow reductive desorption of formate. While the exact degree of oxidation of tin surfaces during CO2R is unlikely to be either fully metallic or fully oxidized, this study highlights the limiting behavior of these two surfaces and lays out the key features of each that our results predict will promote rapid CO2R catalysis. Additionally, we highlight the power of integrating high-fidelity quantum mechanical modeling and spectroscopic measurements to elucidate intricate electrocatalytic reaction pathways.</description>

                Coordination engineering was employed to optimize the coordination environment of the zirconium (Zr) atom anchored on the porphyrins (PP), serving as single-atom catalysts (SACs). Five promising ZrPP-A (A = C3O, N4, N2C2-o, C2O2-o, and C2O2-n) candidates as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) were identified through a "four-step" screening strategy, from a pool of 15 designed models. Performance evaluation of these candidates for NRR was conducted using first-principles calculations. A comprehensive examination of reaction pathways unveiled a predilection for a hybrid pathway when employing the selected catalysts for the NRR. The stability and notable catalytic activity of ZrPP-A stemmed from orbital hybridization and charge transfer mechanisms, occurring both between Zr and its coordinated atoms, as well as between ZrPP-A and the adsorbed N2 molecule. Zr played a pivotal role in orchestrating charge transfer during the NRR process. Simultaneously, coordinating atoms and the PP moiety collectively facilitated supplementary charge transfers to or from the adsorbate. Because of the robust coupling between O and its neighboring carbon atoms, no significant bonds were detected between the central Zr and the coordinating O atoms. An asymmetric coordination environment results in an uneven charge distribution within the substrate, inducing polarization of N2 molecules and their migration toward regions of asymmetric charge aggregation. This study underscores the significance of not only focusing on the single-atom catalyst itself but also its coordination environment when designing catalysts for enhanced efficiency.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation and Durability Analysis of NiFeCoOx Catalysts for Alkaline Water Electrolysis in Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14050322</link>
      <description>Khaja Wahab Ahmed, Michael Fowler, Catalysts. 14(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396897620

                This study examines the catalytic activity of NiFeCoOx catalysts for anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis. The catalysts were synthesized with a Ni to Co ratio of 2:1 and Fe content ranges from 2.5 to 12.5 wt%. The catalysts were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The catalytic activity of the NiFeCoOx catalysts was evaluated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) experiments for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst with 5% Fe content exhibited the highest catalytic activity, achieving an overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Long-term catalyst testing for the OER at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 showed stable electrolysis operation for 100 h. The catalyst was further analyzed in an AEM water electrolyzer in a single-cell test, and the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe at the anode demonstrated the highest current densities of 1516 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1620 mA cm&#8722;2 at 55 &#176;C and 70 &#176;C at 2.1 V. The maximum current density of 1880 mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 2.2 V and 70 &#176;C. The Nyquist plot analysis of electrolysis at 55 &#176;C showed that the NiFeCoOx catalyst with 5% Fe had lower activation resistance compared with the other Fe loadings, indicating enhanced performance. The durability test was performed for 8 h, showing stable AEM water electrolysis with minimum degradation. An overall cell efficiency of 70.5% was achieved for the operation carried out at a higher current density of 0.8 A cm&#8722;2.</description>

                Multifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for development of the key electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, for which single-atom catalyst (SAC) has present great promises. Very recently, some experimental works showed that structurally well-defined ultra-small transition-metal clusters (such as Fe and Co tetramers, denoted as Fe4 and Co4, respectively), can efficiently modulate the catalytic behavior of SACs by axial coordination. Herein, taking the graphene-supported MN4 SACs as representatives, we theoretically explored the feasibility of realizing multifunctional SACs for ORR, OER, and HER by this novel axial coordination engineering. Through extensive first-principles calculations, from 23 candidates, IrN4 decorated with Fe4 (IrN4/Fe4) is identified as the promising trifunctional catalyst with the theoretical overpotential of 0.43, 0.51, and 0.30 V for OER, ORR, and HER, respectively. RhN4/Fe4 and CoN4/Fe4 are recognized as potential OER and ORR bifunctional catalysts. In addition, NiN4/Fe4 exhibits the best ORR activity with an overpotential of 0.30 V, far superior to the pristine NiN4 SAC (0.88 V). Electronic structure analyses reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR activity can be ascribed to the orbital and charge redistribution of Ni active center, resulting from its electronic interaction with Fe4 cluster. This work could stimulate and guide the rational design of graphene-based multifunctional SACs realized by axial coordination of small TM clusters, and provide insights into the modulation mechanism.</description>

                Nitrate in surface and underground water caused systematic risk to the ecological environment. The electrochemically reduction of nitrate into ammonia (NO3RR), offering a sustainable route for nitrate containing wastewater treatment and ammonia fertilizer conversion. Exploration of improved catalysts activity with lower energy barriers is still challenging. Herein, we present a copper nitride (Cu3N) catalyst with moderate *NOx and&#183;H2O intermediates adsorptions showed enhanced NO3RR performance. Density functional theory calculations reveals that the unique electronic structure of Cu3N provides efficient active sites for NO3RR, and enables balanced adsorption of *NO3 and&#183;H2O (&#916;E descriptor) and moderate intermediate (*NO3 &#8594; HNO3, *NH2&#8594;*NH3) adsorption energy. Interestingly, in-situ analysis proved the potential-driven reconstruction and rehabilitation of Cu3N, thus implied for better mechanism understanding. The NO3RR activity of Cu3N surpasses that of most recent catalysts and demonstrates superior stability and implies the application for NH4+ fertilizer recovery, which maintaining an NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 93.1 % and high yield rate of 2.9 mg cm2h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.6 V versus RHE.</description>

                Despite the superior catalytic activity of ordered Pt-M nanoparticles for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), challenges such as particle growth during the ordering transformation and insufficient durability over extended operation hinder their application in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this study, a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is pyrolyzed into zinc and nitrogen-doped carbon (ZnNC). Pt nanoparticles are synthesized on the ZnNC and underwent heat treatment, transforming into ordered PtZn nanoparticles (O-PtZn). Through this simple process, well distributed O-PtZn nanoparticles are obtained with an average particle size of approximately 4.5 nm. The O-PtZn/ZnNC achieves outstanding ORR mass activity and durability compared to the corresponding value of Pt/C both in a half-cell and in a single-cell configuration. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that ZnNC has a strong binding energy with O-PtZn and a minimum distance, resulting in exceptional electrochemical active surface area retention of O-PtZn/ZnNC.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study of Single-Atom Catalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Based on BiTeBr Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102377</link>
      <description>Tao Yang, Qiquan Luo, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396920569

                Developing an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is an effective measure to alleviate the energy crisis. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on Janus materials demonstrated promising prospects for the HER. Herein, density functional theory calculations were conducted to systematically investigate the performance of SACs based on the BiTeBr monolayer. Among the one hundred and forty models that were constructed, fourteen SACs with potential HER activity were selected. Significantly, the SAC, in which a single Ru atom is anchored on a BiTeBr monolayer with a Bi vacancy (RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr), exhibits excellent HER activity with an ultra-low |&#916;GH*| value. A further investigation revealed that RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr tends to react through the Volmer&#8211;Heyrovsky mechanism. An electronic structure analysis provided deeper insights into this phenomenon. This is because the Tafel pathway requires overcoming steric hindrance and disrupting stable electron filling states, making it challenging to proceed. This study finally employed constant potential calculations, which approximate experimental situations. The results indicated that the &#916;GH* value at pH = 0 is 0.056 eV for RuS2/VBi-BiTeBr, validating the rationality of the traditional Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) method for performance evaluation in this system. This work provides a reference for the research of new HER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Potential Model of Two-Dimensional Imine Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Quantum Efficiency for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c00980</link>

                Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) assembled using building blocks have been widely employed in photocatalysis due to their customizable optoelectronic characteristics and porous structure, which facilitate charge carrier and mass movement. Nevertheless, the development of COF photocatalysts encounters a continuous obstacle in enhancing the efficiency of photocatalysis, impeded by a limited comprehension of the orbital interaction between molecular fragments and linkers. In this study, we present a model that examines the interaction between molecular fragments in an imine-based COF at the frontier molecular orbital level, enabling us to comprehend the impact of manipulating linkers on light adsorption, exciton efficiency, and catalytic activity. Our findings demonstrate that altering the connecting orientation of 14 R&#8211;C=N&#8211;R imine linkers in 2D COFs can enhance solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency under visible light from 2.76% to 4.24%. This research has the potential to provide a valuable model for refining photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Effects of graphene doping and gas adsorption on the peak positions of graphene plasmon resonance and adsorbate infrared absorption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1116/6.0003588</link>
      <description>Jongpil Ye, Journal of vacuum science and technology. B, Nanotechnology &amp; microelectronics. 42(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396924530

                The peak positions of graphene plasmon resonance can be controlled to overlap with those of the infrared absorption spectra of gas molecules, allowing highly sensitive detection and identification by graphene nanoribbons. In this study, we investigate the adsorption of gas molecules, including SO2, SO3, H2S, and NH3, on graphene and characterize its effects on the relative positions of the two peaks using density functional theory and the finite difference time domain method. It is demonstrated that the binding energies are stronger, and the amounts of charge transfer are greater in the case of SO2 and SO3 adsorbed on n-doped graphene than in other cases. Electron acceptance by SO2 and SO3 adsorbates on n-doped graphene redshifts the graphene plasmon resonance peaks and their stretching and wagging infrared absorption peaks. However, the former is significantly further redshifted, leading to narrower peak-position-matching ribbon widths in n-doped graphene than in p-doped graphene. The amounts of charge transfer are relatively small regardless of the doping type in the case of NH3 and H2S, mitigating the doping-type dependence compared to SO2 and SO3. The wagging peaks of NH3 on n-doped graphene are shown to be further blueshifted than on p-doped graphene, rendering their peak-position-matching ribbon widths further closer to each other. These results suggest that the effects of doping and adsorption on the two types of peaks should be considered to optimize the performance of graphene plasmon-based gas sensing and identification.</description>

                The presented study is concerned with a new multi-step method to synthesize PtCo/C materials based on composite CoxOy/C that combines the advantages of different liquid-phase synthesis methods. Based on the results of studying the materials at each stage of synthesis with the TG, XRD, TEM, SEI, TXRF, CV and LSV methods, a detailed overview of the sequential changes in catalyst composition and structure at each stage of the synthesis is presented. The PtCo/C catalyst synthesized with the multi-step method is characterized by a uniform distribution of bimetallic nanoparticles of about 3 nm in size over the surface of the support, which result in its high ESA and ORR activity. The activity study for the synthesized PtCo/C catalyst in an MEA showed better current&#8211;voltage characteristics and a higher maximum specific power compared with an MEA based on a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Therefore, the results of the presented study demonstrate high prospects for the developed approach to the multi-step synthesis of PtM/C catalysts, which may enhance the characteristics of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).</description>

      <title>Density Functional Study of Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction in Fourth-Period Transition Metal&#8211;Tetrahydroxyquinone Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102320</link>

                This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal&#8211;organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract Bismuth&#8208;based electrocatalysts are effective for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction to formate. However, at room temperature, these materials are only available in solid state, which inevitably suffers from surface deactivation, declining current densities, and Faradaic efficiencies. Here, the formation of a liquid bismuth catalyst on the liquid gallium surface at ambient conditions is shown as its exceptional performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (i.e., CO 2 RR). By doping a trace amount of bismuth (740 ppm atomic) in gallium liquid metal, a surface enrichment of bismuth by over 400 times (30 at%) in liquid state is obtained without atomic aggregation, achieving 98% Faradic efficiency for CO 2 conversion to formate over 80 h. Ab initio molecular simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal that bismuth atoms in the liquid state are the most energetically favorable sites for the CO 2 RR intermediates, superior to solid Bi&#8208;sites, as well as joint GaBi&#8208;sites. This study opens an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performing liquid&#8208;state metallic catalysts that cannot be reached by elementary metals under electrocatalytic conditions.</description>

                Abstract Nowadays, literature review is a necessary task when trying to solve a given problem. However, an exhaustive literature review is very time-consuming in today&#8217;s vast literature landscape. It can take weeks, even if looking only for abstracts or surveys. Moreover, choosing a method among others, and targeting searches within relevant problem and solution domains, are not easy tasks. These are especially true for young researchers or engineers starting to work in their field. Even if surveys that provide methods used to solve a specific problem already exist, an automatic way to do it for any use case is missing, especially for those who don&#8217;t know the existing literature. Our proposed tool, SARBOLD-LLM, allows discovering and choosing among methods related to a given problem, providing additional information about their uses in the literature to derive decision-making insights, in only a few hours. The SARBOLD-LLM comprises three modules: (1: Scopus search) paper selection using a keyword selection scheme to query Scopus API; (2: Scoring and method extraction) relevancy and popularity scores calculation and solution method extraction in papers utilizing OpenAI API (GPT 3.5); (3: Analyzes) sensitivity analysis and post-analyzes which reveals trends, relevant papers and methods. Comparing the SARBOLD-LLM to manual ground truth using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, the performance results of AI in the oncology case study are 0.68, 0.9, and 0.77, respectively. SARBOLD-LLM demonstrates successful outcomes across various domains, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness. The SARBOLD-LLM addresses engineers more than researchers, as it proposes methods and trends without adding pros and cons. It is a useful tool to select which methods to investigate first and comes as a complement to surveys. This can limit the global search and accumulation of knowledge for the end user.

                Abstract Water electrolysis, a key enabler of hydrogen energy production, presents significant potential as a strategy for achieving net&#8208;zero emissions. However, the widespread deployment of water electrolysis is currently limited by the high&#8208;cost and scarce noble metal electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given this challenge, design and synthesis of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance alternative catalysts have become a research focus, which necessitates insightful understandings of HER fundamentals and material engineering strategies. Distinct from typical reviews that concentrate only on the summary of recent catalyst materials, this review article shifts focus to material engineering strategies for developing efficient HER catalysts. In&#8208;depth analysis of key material design approaches for HER catalysts, such as doping, vacancy defect creation, phase engineering, and metal&#8208;support engineering, are illustrated along with typical research cases. A special emphasis is placed on designing noble metal&#8208;free catalysts with a brief discussion on recent advancements in electrocatalytic water&#8208;splitting technology. The article also delves into important descriptors, reliable evaluation parameters and characterization techniques, aiming to link the fundamental mechanisms of HER with its catalytic performance. In conclusion, it explores future trends in HER catalysts by integrating theoretical, experimental and industrial perspectives, while acknowledging the challenges that remain.</description>

                Abstract Design of active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the electrocatalyst properties and interfacial structural dynamics during OER. One of the essential insights for advanced electrocatalyst design is vivid understanding of the drivers and mechanisms of dissolution of electrocatalysts. In this work we analyze some important aspects of electrocatalyst dissolution during OER, to deepen and advance our understanding of activity&#8208;stability relations and relevant stability descriptors.</description>

                Abstract The low&#8208;energy electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has garnered significant attention as a viable alternative to traditional industrial routes, with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality. For their H 2 O 2 selectivity in the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the coordination environment of tungsten (W)&#8208;based materials is critical. In this study, atomically dispersed W single atoms were immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon substrates by a facile pyrolysis method to obtain a W single&#8208;atom catalyst (W&#8208;SAC). The coordination environment of an isolated W single atom with a tetra&#8208;coordinated porphyrin&#8208;like structure in W&#8208;SAC was determined by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared W&#8208;SAC showed superior two&#8208;electron ORR activity in 0.1 M KOH solution, including high onset potential (0.89 V), high H 2 O 2 selectivity (82.5%), and excellent stability. By using differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that the charge symmetry&#8208;breaking of W atoms changes the adsorption behavior of the intermediates, leading to enhanced reactivity and selectivity for two&#8208;electron ORR. This work broadens the avenue for understanding the charge transfer of W&#8208;based electrocatalytic materials and the in&#8208;depth reaction mechanism of SACs in two&#8208;electron ORR.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Limited Experimental Data with Machine Learning: Differentiating a Methyl from an Ethyl Group in the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c01286</link>
      <description>Osvaldo Jos&#233; Ribeiro Pereira, Marcel Ruth, Dennis Gerbig, Raffael C. Wende, Peter R. Schreiner, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396976914

                We present a case study on how to improve an existing metal-free catalyst for a particularly difficult reaction, namely, the Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata (CBS) reduction of butanone, which constitutes the classic and prototypical challenge of being able to differentiate a methyl from an ethyl group. As there are no known strategies on how to address this challenge, we leveraged the power of machine learning by constructing a realistic (for a typical laboratory) small, albeit high-quality, data set of about 100 reactions (run in triplicate) that we used to train a model in combination with a key-intermediate graph (of substrate and catalyst) to predict the differences in Gibbs activation energies &#916;&#916;G&#8225; of the enantiomeric reaction paths. With the help of this model, we were able to select and subsequently screen a small selection of catalysts and increase the selectivity for the CBS reduction of butanone to 80% enantiomeric excess (ee), the highest possible value achieved to date for this substrate with a metal-free catalyst, thereby also exceeding the best available enzymatic systems (64% ee) and the selectivity with Corey's original catalyst (60% ee). This translates into a &gt;50% improvement in relative &#916;G&#8225; from 0.9 to 1.4 kcal mol&#8211;1. We underscore the transformative potential of machine learning in accelerating catalyst design because we rely on a manageable small data set and a key-intermediate graph representing a combination of catalyst and substrate graphs in lieu of a transition-state model. Our results highlight the synergy of synthetic chemistry and data-centric approaches and provide a blueprint for future catalyst optimization.</description>

      <title>IR Spectroscopy of Carboxylate-Passivated Semiconducting Nanocrystals: Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c01988</link>

                The surfaces of colloidal nanocrystals are frequently passivated with carboxylate ligands that exert significant effects on their optoelectronic properties and chemical stability. The binding geometries of these ligands are often experimentally investigated using vibrational spectroscopy, but the interpretation of the IR signal is usually not trivial. Here, using machine-learning (ML) algorithms trained on DFT data, we simulate an IR spectrum of a lead-rich PbS nanocrystal passivated with butyrate ligands. We obtain good agreement with the experimental signal and demonstrate that the observed line shape stems from a very wide range of "tilted-bridge"-type geometries and does not indicate the coexistence of "bridging" and "chelating" binding modes as has been previously assumed. This work illustrates the limitations of empirical spectrum assignment and demonstrates the effectiveness of ML-driven molecular dynamics simulations in reproducing the IR spectra of nanoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>A reactive neural network framework for water-loaded acidic zeolites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48609-2</link>
      <description>Andreas Erlebach, Martin &#352;&#237;pka, Indranil Saha, Petr Nachtigall, Christopher J. Heard, Luk&#225;&#353; Grajciar, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396999021

                Abstract Under operating conditions, the dynamics of water and ions confined within protonic aluminosilicate zeolite micropores are responsible for many of their properties, including hydrothermal stability, acidity and catalytic activity. However, due to high computational cost, operando studies of acidic zeolites are currently rare and limited to specific cases and simplified models. In this work, we have developed a reactive neural network potential (NNP) attempting to cover the entire class of acidic zeolites, including the full range of experimentally relevant water concentrations and Si/Al ratios. This NNP has the potential to dramatically improve sampling, retaining the (meta)GGA DFT level accuracy, with the capacity for discovery of new chemistry, such as collective defect formation mechanisms at the zeolite surface. Furthermore, we exemplify how the NNP can be used as a basis for further extensions/improvements which include data-efficient adoption of higher-level (hybrid) references via &#916;-learning and the acceleration of rare event sampling via automatic construction of collective variables. These developments represent a significant step towards accurate simulations of realistic catalysts under operando conditions.</description>

                Abstract As a sustainable energy technology, electrocatalytic energy conversion requires electrocatalysts, which greatly motivates the exploitation of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts based on nonprecious metals. Molybdenum&#8208;based nanomaterials have demonstrated promise as electrocatalysts because of their unique physiochemical and electronic properties. Among them, atomic Mo catalysts, also called Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (Mo&#8208;SACs), have the most accessible active sites and tunable microenvironments and are thrivingly explored in various electrochemical conversion reactions. A timely review of such rapidly developing topics is necessary to provide guidance for further exploration of optimized Mo&#8208;SACs toward electrochemical energy technologies. In this review, recent advances in the synthetic strategies for Mo&#8208;SACs are highlighted, focusing on the microenvironment engineering of Mo atoms. Then, the representative achievements of their applications in various electrocatalytic reactions involving the N 2 , H 2 O, and CO 2 cycles are summarized by combining experimental and computational results. Finally, prospects for the future development of Mo&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are provided and the key challenges that require further investigation and optimization are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Eggshell&#8208;Like Carbon Microspheres with Curvature Scheme: Distorted Energy Band and Atomic Charge Waves&#8208;Driven High Performance for Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402168</link>
      <description>Qiheng Wang, Ruixue Li, Wenquan Feng, Mengying Liu, Peng Li, Jingjun Liu, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397013926

                Abstract A metal&#8208;free nanocarbon with an eggshell structure is synthesized from chitosan (CS) and natural spherical graphite (NSG) as a cathode electrocatalyst for clean zinc&#8208;air batteries and fuel cells. It is developed using CS&#8208;derived carbons as an eggshell, covering NSG cores. The synthesis involves the in situ growth of CS on NSG, followed by ammonia&#8208;assisted pyrolysis for carbonization. The resulting catalyst displays a curved structure and completely coated NSG, showing superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. In 1 M NaOH, the ORR half&#8208;wave potential reached 0.93 V, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst by 50 mV. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;air battery featuring the catalyst achieves a peak power density of 167 mW cm &#8208;2 with excellent stability, outperforming the Pt/C. The improved performance of the eggshell carbons can be attributed to the distorted energy band of the active sites in the form of N&#8208;C moieties. More importantly, the curved thin eggshells induce built&#8208;in electric fields that can promote electron redistribution to generate atomic charge waves around the N&#8208;C moieties on the carbon shells.

                Emerging as a new class of two&#8208;dimensional materials with atomically thin layers, MBenes have great potential for many important applications such as energy storage and electrocatalysis. Toward mitigating carbon footprint, there has been increasing interest in CO 2 /CO conversion on MBenes, but mostly focused on C 1 products. C 2+ chemicals generally possess higher energy densities and wider applications than C 1 counterparts. However, C&#8211;C coupling is technically challenging because of high energy requirement and currently few catalysts are suited for this process. Here, we explore electrochemical CO reduction reaction to C 2 chemicals on Mo 2 B 2 O 2 MBene via density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Remarkably, the most favorable CO&#8211;COH coupling is revealed to be a spontaneous and barrierless process, making Mo 2 B 2 O 2 an efficient catalyst for C&#8211;C coupling. Among C 1 and C 2 chemicals, ethanol is predicted to be the primary product. Furthermore, by charge and bond analysis, it is unraveled that there exist significantly more unbonded electrons in the C atom of intermediate *COH than other C 1 intermediates, which is responsible for the facile C&#8211;C coupling. From an atomic scale, this work provides microscopic insight into C&#8211;C coupling process and suggests Mo 2 B 2 O 2 a promising catalyst for electrochemical CO reduction to C 2 chemicals.</description>

                In addressing the challenging quest for an efficient electrocatalyst in electrochemical water splitting, we demonstrate an Fe-doped NiO nanosheet array anchored on nickel foam synthesized via a two-step process. Demonstrating exceptional performance in an alkaline electrolyte, FeNiO catalysts exhibit the oxygen evolution reaction with a low potential of 1.52 V vs RHE and the urea oxidation reaction of 1.32 V vs RHE @ 10 mA/cm2. The bifunctional electrolyzer generates 10 mA/cm2 current at 1.95 V for water and 1.59 V for urea electrolysis at ambient temperature. Promisingly, the FeNiO catalyst based electrolyzer generates hydrogen at an industrial-scale current density of 400 mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of just 1.91 V in concentrated alkaline electrolyte and elevated temperature (80 &#176;C) due to the dimensionally stable and robust behavior of the self-supported catalyst. The activation energy for alkaline water electrolysis is found to be 52 kJ/mol. The present catalysts also demonstrate stable performance at 300 mA/cm2 in 4 M KOH electrolyte at 50 &#176;C for more than 20 h. The synergy induced by Fe doping into NiO activates catalytic sites, expediting charge transfer and reaction kinetics. The present research report highlights the potential of catalysts as a practical and cost-effective approach for green hydrogen production via water splitting.</description>

                CO 2 capture and utilization has been attracting intensive attention owing to its vital importance in long-standing carbon emission reduction. Numerous novel catalysts and strategies for the integrated conversion of CO 2 have been developed in past decades. Here, we review our recent electronic structure calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on CO 2 activation and catalytic transformation. The focus is mainly on the computational design of several types of low-dimensional, nanomaterial-supported, atomically dispersed metal and nonmetal catalysts for electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO 2 as well as metal macrocycles for the coupling of CO 2 with epoxides. Based on extensive calculations and simulations, detailed reaction mechanisms, performances of catalysts, and structure-activity relationships for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic transformation of CO 2 have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Atomically dispersed Iridium on Mo2C as an efficient and stable alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction catalyst</title>

                Abstract Hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs) have the advantages of using cost-effective materials, but hindered by the sluggish anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics. Here, we report an atomically dispersed Ir on Mo 2 C nanoparticles supported on carbon (Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C) as highly active and stable HOR catalysts. The specific exchange current density of Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C is 4.1 mA cm &#8722;2 ECSA , which is 10 times that of Ir/C. Negligible decay is observed after 30,000-cycle accelerated stability test. Theoretical calculations suggest the high HOR activity is attributed to the unique Mo 2 C substrate, which makes the Ir sites with optimized H binding and also provides enhanced OH binding sites. By using a low loading (0.05 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 ) of Ir SA -Mo 2 C/C as anode, the fabricated HEMFC can deliver a high peak power density of 1.64 W cm &#8722;2 . This work illustrates that atomically dispersed precious metal on carbides may be a promising strategy for high performance HEMFCs.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Catalytic Performance of Mo2C/MoS2 Composite Heterojunction Catalysts</title>

                Hydrogen, as a clean, safe, and efficient energy carrier, is one of the hot energy sources that have attracted much attention. Mo2C, due to the introduction of C atoms, makes the atomic spacing of the Mo lattice decrease and changes the width of the d-band, which makes the electronic properties of Mo2C similar to that of Pt noble metals, exhibiting excellent electrochemical hydrogen precipitation performance. MoS2, due to its special crystal structure and tunable electronic structure, has been widely studied. In this paper, Mo2C nanoparticles were prepared by high-temperature carbonization, and then two-dimensional layered MoS2 were be loaded on Mo2C nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method to synthesize Mo2C/MoS2 composite catalysts. Their electrochemical hydrogen precipitation (HER) performance under acidic conditions was tested. The above catalysts were also characterized by modern material testing methods such as XRD, SEM, TEM, and XPS. The results showed that the composite catalysts exhibited the most excellent electrochemical hydrogen precipitation performance at Mo2C/MoS2-3, with the lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, Tafel slope, and electrochemical impedance. At the same time, the electrochemically active area was dramatically enhanced, with good stability under prolonged testing. The catalytic activity was significantly improved compared with that of Mo2C and MoS2. The characterization and experimental results indicate that the heterogeneous structure of Mo2C and MoS2 formed a built-in electric field between the two, which accelerated the electron transfer efficiency and provided more active sites. The Mo2C/MoS2 composite catalyst is a low-cost, easy-to-prepare, and high-efficiency electrochemical hydrogen precipitation catalyst, providing a new idea for developing green and clean energy.</description>
