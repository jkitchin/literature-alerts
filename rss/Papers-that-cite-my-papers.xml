                CNx catalysts show promising activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under acidic conditions, but the nature of the active site is still under debate. ORR on CNx has been found to be resistant to common poisons such as CO, H2S, and CN. In this study, we demonstrate that bubbling CO2 in the electrolyte can lead to the partial poisoning of CNx for ORR activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show a partial decrease in the ORR activity for CNx catalysts after bubbling CO2 through a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The relative stability of CO2-derived species (CO2*, H2CO3*, HCO3*, and CO3*) on 13 CNx site models at 1.0 V-RHE was examined using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations predict that HCO3 is favored adjacent to the N species on several CNx site models and CO3 is favored on pyrrolic sites. Difference spectra of the N 1s from near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of the ex-situ poisoned CNx and pristine CNx shows a shift in binding energies of N species that qualitatively match the DFT N 1s binding energy shifts due to HCO3/CO3 on the CNx site models. DFT predicts that these HCO3 surface species can block and delay the initial step of the ORR on several CNx sites.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Synergistic Role of Sm&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;3+&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Doped NiFe&#8208;LDH as High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts for Improved Anion Exchange Membrane and Water Splitting Applications</title>

      <description>Sreenivasan Nagappan, Hemalatha Gurusamy, Harpriya Minhas, Arun Karmakar, S. Ravichandran, Biswarup Pathak, Subrata Kundu, Small Methods. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405476280

                Abstract Effective first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts are crucial for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios in NiFe&#8208;LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm&#8315; 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe&#8208;LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non&#8208;noble composites for long&#8208;term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Design and Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Inorganic Frameworks Using Host Atom&#8208;Centered Building Blocks for Efficient Catalysis with Diverse Reactive Sites</title>

                Abstract The modular assembly of organic molecules commonly guides the design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), yet the systematic exploration of inorganic building blocks remains limited. Given the promising applications in catalytic reactions and topological materials, the study of metal&#8211;inorganic frameworks (MIFs)&#8212;which fundamentally differ from the well&#8208;established MOFs&#8212;has become urgent. This study introduces a strategy for designing MIFs using host atom&#8208;centered building blocks, applied to the platinum&#8211;Phosphorus (Pt&#8211;P) system. By combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations, a Pt 18 P 18 framework utilizing PtP 3 building blocks, demonstrating significant energetic benefits is proposed. PtP 3 units are employed to characterize Pt 3 P 6 clusters within the pores, leading to a &#8220;compass&#8221; model that aligns with experimental findings. To address computational challenges associated with the large periodicity of the superstructure, a robust machine learning force field is developed. The analysis, combining surface nucleation studies, first&#8208;principles calculations, and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive understanding of MIF structure. This validated Pt&#8211;P MIF exhibits exceptional catalytic properties with diverse reaction sites, significantly outperforming Pt(111) in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The findings not only present additional candidates for practical applications of metal phosphides but also highlight the vast potential of MIFs, paving the way for the discovery of numerous promising materials.</description>

      <title>Smart Compositional Design of B&#8208;Site Ordered Double Perovskite for Advanced Oxygen Catalysis at Ultra&#8208;High Current Densities</title>

                Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B&#8208;site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B&#8242; and B&#8243; sites. Controlling B&#8208;site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B&#8208;site cation with a d&#8208;band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of &#8722;8.05 mA cm &#8722;2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm &#8722;2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at &#8722;1 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), &#916;E is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as&#8208;designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.</description>

                Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source for low-carbon and sustainable mobility purposes. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. The complex nature of the ORR and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows. Here, we present a state-of-the-art study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate ORR on platinum-based surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the great potentiality of quantum computers in solving notoriously difficult systems with strongly correlated electronic structures and suggest platinum/cobalt as ideal candidate for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.</description>

      <title>The V30 benchmark set for anharmonic vibrational frequencies of molecular dimers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0238491</link>
      <description>Johannes Hoja, A. Daniel Boese, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405541010

                Intermolecular vibrations are extremely challenging to describe but are the most crucial part for determining entropy and hence free energies and enable, for instance, the distinction between different crystal-packing arrangements of the same molecule via THz spectroscopy. Herein, we introduce a benchmark dataset&#8212;V30&#8212;containing 30 small molecular dimers with intermolecular interactions ranging from exclusively van der Waals dispersion to systems with hydrogen bonds. All the calculations are performed with the gold standard of quantum chemistry CCSD(T). We discuss vibrational frequencies obtained via different models starting with the harmonic approximation over independent Morse oscillators up to second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which allows a proper anharmonic treatment including coupling of vibrational modes. However, large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency intermolecular modes are problematic for VPT2. In analogy to the often used treatment for internal rotations, we replace such problematic modes by a simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model. We compare selected dimers to the available experimental data or high-level calculations of potential energy surfaces and show that VPT2 in combination with hindered rotors can yield a very good description of fundamental frequencies for the discussed subset of dimers involving small and semi-rigid molecules.</description>

      <title>NMR Investigations of Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in MOFs and COFs</title>

                Host&#8211;guest interactions in porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) play a key role in enhancing the performance of these materials for practical applications; however, it is often very challenging to investigate these interactions at the molecular level. In recent years, many solid-state NMR (SSNMR) approaches, including in situ variable temperature (VT), 2D correlation, and pulsed field gradient (PFG) experiments, have offered unique insights into the local structure and dynamics of adsorbed guest molecules in MOFs and COFs. Recent SSNMR studies of MOFs and COFs containing guest molecules are summarized in this chapter. These reports encompass a variety of gaseous and liquid guests such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and methanol. We also highlight studies involving larger guest molecules, drugs, and biomolecules. It is apparent that SSNMR spectroscopy can provide a wealth of data pertaining to host&#8211;guest interactions in these materials; the information available commonly includes the number and location of guest adsorption sites, guest binding strengths, guest dynamics and diffusion rates, and guest-induced structural changes in the host. The studies discussed in this chapter illustrate how SSNMR spectroscopy serves as a powerful tool to probe host&#8211;guest interactions in MOFs/COFs, especially given the variety of potential target nuclei and the numerous experimental strategies that are available.</description>

      <title>Long Time Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Magnesium Hydride Dehydrogenation Enabled by Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>

                Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for solid-state hydrogen storage due to its high gravimetric hydrogen capacity as well as the abundance and low cost of magnesium. The material's limiting factor is the high dehydrogenation temperature (over 300 &#176;C) and sluggish (de)hydrogenation kinetics when no catalyst is present, making it impractical for onboard applications. Catalysts and physical restructuring (e.g., through ball milling) have both shown kinetic improvements, without full theoretical understanding as to why. In this work, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) for the Mg&#8211;H system, which was used to run long time scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a thick magnesium hydride surface slab for up to 1 ns. Our MLP-based MD simulations reveal previously unreported behavior of subsurface molecular H2 formation and subsequent trapping in the subsurface layer of MgH2. This hindered diffusion of subsurface H2 offers a partial explanation on the slow dehydrogenation kinetics of MgH2. The kinetics will be improved if a catalyst obstructs subsurface formation and trapping of H2 or if the diffusion of subsurface H2 is improved through defects created by physical restructuring.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Role of Adsorbates Entropy in the Reactivity of Single-Atom Catalysts</title>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are rapidly gaining attention as a versatile class of materials that combine the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. A growing number of studies aim to identify potential new SACs or to describe their structure and reactivity through ab initio quantum chemical simulations. While many computational studies primarily address reactions involving small molecules, such as water splitting or CO2 reduction, the application scope of SACs is rapidly broadening to include the production of fine chemicals and the conversion of biomass-derived platform molecules, processes that involve larger, more complex reactants. Using density-functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrate that, while an approximate treatment of entropy is acceptable for molecules with up to three atoms, it introduces substantial errors in reactions involving more complex molecules. Our results reveal a linear correlation between the entropy of adsorbed molecules and that of the corresponding isolated species, mirroring trends observed on extended catalytic surfaces. For the largest systems investigated in this study, the entropy of the free molecule is reduced by approximately 10&#8211;20% upon adsorption; for small molecules, this reduction can range from 50 to 70%. This disparity arises because, on SACs, the translational entropy is effectively zero, the rotational entropy is minimal, and the vibrational entropy increases with the size of the molecule. Moreover, the entropy of adsorbates scales linearly with the number of atoms in the molecule, allowing for the prediction of entropic contributions of adsorbates on SACs without additional computational cost. Using propyne hydrogenation as a test, we demonstrate that the reaction energy profile computed with current approximate approaches for estimating the entropy of adsorbates differs significantly from the profile where entropy is explicitly included. These findings highlight the importance of considering adsorbate entropy for accurately predicting the catalytic activity of SACs, particularly for reactions involving complex molecules.</description>

      <title>Controlling Co 3d/O 2p Orbital Hybridization in LaCoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by Modulating the Co&#8211;O&#8211;Co Bond Angle for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis</title>

                The orbital hybridization between metal and oxygen of perovskite catalysts can lower the overpotential and enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. This study combines density functional theory with experiments to clarify how Sr/Fe codoping modulates orbital hybridization and enhances OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3. The as-prepared La0.50Sr0.50Co0.75Fe0.25O3 shows remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 current density and a 107.03 mV dec&#8211;1 Tafel slope, outperforming most state-of-the-art perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. The experimental results confirm that Sr/Fe codoping enhances the expansion of Co&#8211;O&#8211;Co bond angles and strengthens the covalency of the Co&#8211;O bond in LaCoO3, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Moreover, increasing Sr doping reduces the distance between the Co 3d/O 2p center and the Fermi level, decreasing the energy difference between them and enhancing the degree of orbital hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. As the degree of Co 3d/O 2p orbital hybridization increases, a higher charge transfer was found between the active center and intermediate product, OOH, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step while lowering the overpotential. This study provides thorough insight into the rational design of OER catalysts based on orbital hybridization.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to a number of attractive properties allowing their application in different catalytic processes, including electrochemical ones. Due to the nature of the active site, consisting of only a few atoms, SACs are also very attractive for theoretical modeling as the active site can be directly translated into the computational model. However, as a rule, the possibility of the active site change induced by pH and electrode potential is disregarded in theoretical models. This Perspective emphasizes the need to address the actual state of SA electrocatalysts under operating conditions before considering their catalytic activity and selectivity. The concept of surface Pourbaix plot, well-known in electrochemistry, can be directly transferred to SACs, providing valuable insights and guidance for developing novel catalytic materials. We discuss recent approaches to designing Pourbaix plots for SACs and outline the importance of properly treating the actual state of SACs and other emerging types of catalysts.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Adsorbate Free Energy Using the Damping Function Method</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01079</link>

                Adsorbate free energies are important parameters in surface chemistry and catalysis. Because of its simplicity, the harmonic oscillator (HO) model remains the most widely used method for calculating adsorbate free energy in many fields, including microkinetic modeling. However, it is well-known that the HO method is ineffective for weak adsorption. In this study, we propose a translational model with a diffusion barrier to calculate the state functions of near free translation. Furthermore, an effective mass is introduced in this model. To address hindered translation uniformly, a diffusion barrier-based damping function (DF) is proposed that effectively links the harmonic vibration and translation limits. Adsorbates are divided into three categories according to their adsorption strength and diffusion barrier height. Adsorbed hydrogen atoms have a strong binding energy and relatively high vibrational frequency but a low diffusion barrier. The HT and our proposed DF methods predict that the adsorbed hydrogen atoms behave as translation above room temperature, while the previous DF method predicts that they behave as vibration at any temperature. At last, the dehydrogenation reaction of propane on the Pt(111) surface was taken as an example to illustrate the influence of different methods on the thermodynamic functions.</description>

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet&#8208;controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed&#8208;mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core&#8211;shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid&#8208;solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low&#8208;index and high&#8208;index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition&#8208; and facet&#8208;dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi&#8208;elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.</description>

                Hydrogen emerges as a pivotal clean and versatile energy carrier amid global energy challenges, urging a shift towards renewable hydrogen production. The efficiency of the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) hinges on catalyst choice, ambient conditions, and electrolyte pH. In transitioning away from costly and scarce catalysts like Pt or Ru, researchers explore Earth-abundant alternatives, notably transition metal-based quantum dots (QDs) and MXenes. QDs offer high surface area and customizable properties, while MXenes demonstrate exceptional conductivity and surface area. QDs, despite challenges such as agglomeration, prove effective when engineered into composites. MXenes, with their unique stacked structure and chemical robustness, hold promise for HER catalysis. As discussed, QDs and MXenes exhibit schematic HER representations, emphasizing their potential as catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production and their adaptability to span diverse fields, offering scalable solutions towards a renewable energy future.</description>

                Hydrogen is regarded as a vital resource for the advancement of renewable energy technologies. Electrocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a viable technique for producing ultra-pure hydrogen. The electrocatalyst, which can catalyze the electrochemical process to decrease the overpotential by increasing the current density, is critical to the effectiveness of this approach. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have become recognized as possible electrocatalysts in recent years due to their exposed surface active sites, evenly distributed interconnected pore structure, and adjustable shape. Thus, the significance of homogeneous and heterogeneous MOFs and their derivatives for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution process (HER) is summarized in this chapter. The chapter begins with an overview of the fundamentals of the electrocatalytic HER, after which the importance of various transition metal-based pristine MOFs and their derivatives towards the HER is examined. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement given their sub-par intrinsic activity and weak conductivity. Various MOF-derived composites, as well as new methodologies and procedures, are given to solve intrinsic activity and conductivity issues, emphasizing progress in MOF-based materials for a more effective HER electrocatalyst in large-scale hydrogen production.</description>

                Abstract The concentrated alkaline passivates the monolithic electrode for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) industry. Herein, a surface engineering of cathodic protection via one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of P into NiCuV is presented and the achieved monolithic electrode exhibits an enhanced electrochemical catalytic behavior and constant durability with a feedback potential of &#8722;0.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under an extremely high current density of 1A cm &#8722;2 for more than 270 h in alkaline media. The strategy of cathodic protection optimises the charge density redistribution by forming a phosphate surface layer. This preserves the particular metal (alloy) phase from oxidation while also modulating the heterarchical porous structure through P incorporation. Furthermore, an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with the NiCuVP serving as the HER catalyst and the NiFeCr LDH as the OER catalyst is constructed, which exhibits a current density of 912 mA cm &#8722;2 at 2 V at 80 &#176;C with 30 wt.% KOH electrolytes. The resultant factors for activity and durability such as the electrochemical specific area, redox behaviors and surface hydrophilicity are also systematically discussed. This research presents a practical protocol for the anticorrosion and active enhancement of AWE and AEMWE cathodes.</description>

      <title>Assessment of electron&#8211;proton correlation functionals for vibrational spectra of shared-proton systems by constrained nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0243086</link>

                Proton transfer plays a crucial role in various chemical and biological processes. A major theoretical challenge in simulating proton transfer arises from the quantum nature of the proton. The constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (CNEO) framework was recently developed to efficiently and accurately account for nuclear quantum effects, particularly quantum nuclear delocalization effects, in quantum chemistry calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we systematically investigate challenging proton transfer modes in a series of shared-proton systems using CNEO density functional theory (CNEO-DFT), focusing on evaluating existing electron&#8211;proton correlation functionals. Our results show that CNEO-DFT accurately describes proton transfer vibrational modes and significantly outperforms conventional DFT. The inclusion of the epc17-2 electron&#8211;proton correlation functional in CNEO-DFT produces similar performance to that without electron&#8211;proton correlations, while the epc17-1 functional yields less accurate results, comparable with conventional DFT. These findings hold true for both asymmetrical and symmetrical shared-proton systems. Therefore, until a more accurate electron&#8211;proton correlation functional is developed, we currently recommend performing vibrational spectrum calculations using CNEO-DFT without electron&#8211;proton correlation functionals.</description>
