                ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing sustainable materials science, yet a comprehensive and timely evaluation of the rapidly evolving AI techniques applied across the entire materials lifecycle remains lacking. This work reviews AI&#8208;driven advances in sustainable materials, specifically focusing on battery materials, thermal management materials, energy conversion materials, and catalysts. The key patterns, capabilities, and limitations of AI are identified across three interconnected phases: sustainable materials design (leveraging predictive and generative models for accelerated discovery), green processing (integrating adaptive synthesis optimization and autonomous experimentation), and extending to lifecycle management (encompassing real&#8208;time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and intelligent recycling). Then, the persistent challenges, including data sparsity, domain&#8208;specific knowledge integration, and limited model generalizability, are investigated, followed by an exploration of emerging solutions such as federated learning for privacy&#8208;preserving data sharing, physics&#8208;informed neural networks for knowledge integration, and multimodal AI for cross&#8208;modal knowledge transfer. Finally, the computational sustainability challenges of AI methods themselves are also discussed. This review highlights key bottlenecks impeding scalable adoption and discuss pathways for realizing the full potential of AI in sustainable materials development.</description>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently emerged as promising electrocatalysts for complex reactions owing to their tunable electronic structures and diverse, unique binding sites. However, their vast compositional space, in terms of both elemental variety and atomic ratios, presents a major challenge to the rational design of high-performance catalysts, as experimental efforts are often hindered by ambiguous element selection and inefficient trial-and-error methods. In this work, a bottom-up research strategy using machine learning-assisted first-principles calculations was applied to accelerate the design of quinary HEAs toward efficient multielectron transfer reactions. Here, we report the design of PtPdRhRuMo, which exhibits key physicochemical properties favoring the methanol oxidation reaction. Notably, the incorporation of Mo as the fifth element significantly activates specific binding sites on HEA surfaces, enhancing methanol adsorption and, in particular, the water dissociation ability. This facilitates hydroxyl species formation, which effectively mitigates CO intermediate adherence while promoting the complete oxidation of CH3OH to CO2 via alternative reaction pathways. Guided by theoretical predictions, experimental samples with different morphologies of mesoporous PtPdRhRuMo catalyst (m-HEANP(Mo) nanoparticles and m-HEAF(Mo) thin film) were then synthesized, demonstrating superior electrocatalysis with a large current density of up to 18.20 mA cm-2 and a mass activity of 9.89 A mgPt-1, alongside the long-term durability for efficient methanol electrooxidation applications.</description>

      <title>What formate electro-oxidation can teach us about CO poisoning on Pt during biomass oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7263225/v1</link>
      <description>Silvia Favero, Zhe Meng, Henrik H. Kristoffersen, Jan Rossmeisl, Ifan E. L. Stephens, Maria&#8208;Magdalena Titirici, Yu Katayama, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413956753

                Abstract Catalyst deactivation due to *CO poisoning is a persistent challenge in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass-derived molecules such as glycerol and glucose. On platinum catalysts, *CO forms readily as a reaction intermediate, blocking active sites and requiring high overpotentials for removal&#8212;often leading to undesired overoxidation of valuable products. Understanding the fundamental origins of *CO formation is thus critical for designing more selective and stable catalysts. Since biomass oxidation can be extremely complex and involve a multitude of adsorbates and products, here we use a simplified model system, formate oxidation, to investigate *CO formation on Pt in alkaline pH . Starting from operando surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, we show that the adsorption configuration of formate determines if the surface will be poisoned by *CO. Oxygen-bound formate (*OOCH) undergoes direct and stable oxidation to CO&#8322;, while carbon-bound formate (*COOH) disproportionates to form *CO&#8211;*OH, initiating poisoning. These insights offer a mechanistic foundation for designing Pt-based catalysts that resist *CO formation by selectively stabilizing *OOCH over *COOH intermediates, with broader implications for improving biomass electrooxidation performance.</description>

      <title>Molecular Orbital Level Micro&#8208;Electric Field in Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry for Water Treatment: From Mechanism Understanding to Scale&#8208;Up Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202509280</link>
      <description>Qingbai Tian, Qian Li, Tianran Zhang, Weihua Huang, Chuanliang Zhao, Bo Hu, Xing Xu, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413960944

                Abstract Fenton&#8208;like systems utilizing micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;engineered catalysts have emerged as a promising technology for water remediation, demonstrating distinctive advantages via their efficient electron transport networks. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces oxidant consumption but also enables thorough mineralization of contaminants. However, current research faces critical challenges in fundamental mechanistic understanding, particularly regarding reactor scale&#8208;up strategies and biological synergy mechanisms, where a cohesive theoretical framework remains to be established. This comprehensive review systematically addresses four pivotal aspects: i) Mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer dynamics and pollutant transformation pathways in micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;enhanced Fenton systems; ii) Development of structure&#8208;activity relationship models for system optimization; iii) Implementation of modular scale&#8208;up methodologies with pilot&#8208;scale validation for engineering feasibility assessment; iv) Quantitative environmental impact evaluation using full lifecycle assessment under carbon neutrality objectives. By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets.</description>

      <title>Pb-Induced Electronic Structure Modification Enhances Formic Acid Electrooxidation on Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04219</link>
      <description>Radhey Shyam Yadav, Haya Kornweitz, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413964937

                The efficiency of formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO) is often hindered by CO poisoning via the indirect pathway, underscoring the need for catalysts that promote the direct (CO-free) oxidation route. Pd-based catalysts are promising, but a limited understanding of surface interactions and catalytic behavior restricts further development. Density functional theory (DFT) combined with Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis was employed to investigate the FAEO on Pd3Pb(111) and Pd(111) surfaces, revealing a key insight into their electronic and catalytic behavior. Incorporation of Pb into the Pd lattice enhances the catalytic performance by modifying the electronic structure and introducing new active sites. This study revealed the role of the subsurface Pb atom, which enhances HCOO binding at Pd&#8211;Pd bridge sites and strengthens CO and H adsorption at hexagonal closest packed (hcp) hollow sites over face-centered cubic (fcc) sites. The FAEO process proceeds more efficiently on Pd3Pb via O&#8211;H bond cleavage, forming an HCOO intermediate with a lower activation energy (0.29 eV) than on Pd (0.35 eV). Pd3Pb favors the HCOO-mediated pathway, while Pd prefers the COOH-mediated route. Additionally, Pb significantly lowers the energy barrier for HCOO rotation (0.51 vs 0.84 eV), enhancing CO-free oxidation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Charge, Dopant, and H Saturation on the Hydrogen Evolution Activity of Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Thiolate-Protected Nanoclusters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acselectrochem.5c00260</link>
      <description>Laura Laverdure, Nisha Mammen, Hannu H&#228;kkinen, Karoliina Honkala, ACS electrochemistry.. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414005646

                This study examines the effects of charge, dopant type, and hydrogen saturation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of thiolate-protected Au25-based nanoclusters using density functional theory (DFT). By extending the analysis to include up to 10 hydrogen atoms, this work captures the behavior of these nanoclusters under realistic HER reaction conditions, providing a broader understanding of the catalytic properties. Our findings, supported by Pourbaix diagrams, reveal that high hydrogen coverages dominate under HER-relevant potentials. Pt- and Pd-doped clusters exhibit remarkable structural stability, retaining their icosahedral core even at high hydrogen coverage. The detachment of thiol (HSR) and HAu-S(R)H molecules creates more accessible active sites enhancing catalytic efficiency. These clusters also support low H (2H) coverage states at less negative potentials, further contributing to their promising catalytic activity reported in the experimental literature. In contrast, Cu-, Ag-, Zn-, Cd-, and Hg-doped clusters undergo structural collapse of the icosahedral core as hydrogen coverage increases and stabilize only high coverage clusters (&gt;7H), correlating with their lower reactivity observed experimentally. These results highlight the critical role of dopant-induced structural and electronic dynamics in governing HER pathways and provide new insights into designing efficient nanocluster catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Cone-Shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton Method: Efficient and Robust Single-Ended Transition State Optimization Algorithm</title>

                Efficient transition state location is a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. While single-ended methods are more efficient than double-ended methods, their convergence is often highly sensitive to the quality of the initial guess. Here, we propose a Cone-shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton (CCQN) method, which introduces a cone-shaped constraint to restrict the search direction, thereby effectively guiding the system from potential well regions toward saddle regions. After crossing the inflection curve, the optimization switches to the partitioned rational function optimization algorithm for further refinement. This curvature partitioned optimization strategy reduces the sensitivity to the quality of the initial guess while maintaining the efficiency of single-ended methods. Across 150 transition state optimization tasks with varying initial guess qualities, CCQN achieves an overall success rate of 93.3%, requiring only approximately 50 energy-force evaluations on average. The method exhibits strong robustness and convergence efficiency, offering a new tool for high-throughput transition state searches and mechanistic studies of complex catalytic reactions.</description>

                Precise modulation of the electronic structure in transition metals, particularly the d-band center position and spin state, remains a critical challenge to expediting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Herein, we report a NiPt/Ni-heterostructured catalyst enabling simultaneous optimization of the d-band electronic structure and spin state of Ni through regulation of the NiPt and Ni bridge sites. Combining operando spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we establish that the coordination environment and spin states of Ni at the bridge sites were effectively modulated by altering the Pt content, achieving a transition of Ni centers from the low-spin to high-spin state, and optimized intermediate adsorption/desorption behaviors. The resulting NiPt/Ni catalyst exhibits an exceptional HER performance in acidic media, achieving a benchmark current density of -10 mA cm-2 at a mere 9.8 mV overpotential and delivering an industrial-scale 1.0 A cm-2 current density in PEM electrolysis at 1.75 V.</description>

                Abstract Many high-entropy oxides exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting. In this study, a coating of oxide-carbide composites containing Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo was electrodeposited in a C 2 H 6 SO (DMSO)-based solution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of carbides, oxides, and oxygen vacancies. Except for some metallic nickel, most metals exist in the oxidized or hydroxide states. Aqua- and chloro-complexes of metal ions have been proposed to form oxides and carbides on copper via the reduction of hydrated water and organic molecules. The coating exhibited high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, achieving an overpotential of 216 mV, corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm. The long-term stability at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 was investigated for 50 h, with a stable overpotential and minor surface dissolution. The catalytic activity was determined using density functional theory, and the unsaturated oxidation number of the metal atoms was calculated to depict the relationship between the binding state and the overpotential of the active sites.

      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7463697/v1</link>
      <description>Lei Wang, Yan Chen, Xueru Wang, Xiaobin Deng, Yilun Liu, Xi Chen, Jun Zhang, Yunwei Zhang, Hang Xiao, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024291

                Abstract Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties remains a central challenge in materials science, requiring exploration of vast chemical spaces containing potentially 10100 possible structures. Current generative approaches face limitations in computational efficiency, multi-property targeting precision and mechanistic interpretability. Here, we introduce MatterGPT, an autoregressive Transformer-decoder architecture that leverages SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) representation to generate novel crystals through conditional next-token prediction. Trained on 306,533 crystal structures, MatterGPT achieves &gt; 99% structural validity, &gt; 99% structural uniqueness and &gt; 50% novelty rates while targeting both specific lattice-insensitive and lattice-sensitive properties. Critically, MatterGPT enables direct multi-property generation without post-generation filtering. Interpretability analysis reveals clear property-guided generation mechanisms and systematic chemical space exploration. The comprehensive open-source release, including MatterGPT Hub integration platform, establishes sequence-based autoregressive generation as a computationally efficient and interpretable paradigm for inverse crystal design, accelerating materials discovery across energy storage, electronics, and functional applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Modeling of Rare Earth Ions in Photonic Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bio.70297</link>
      <description>Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Mohd Zulkifli Bin Mohamad Noor, Masoud Darvish Ganji, Leonardo Goliatt, Luminescence. 40(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024557

                ABSTRACT Rare&#8208;earth ions (REIs), especially trivalent lanthanides (Ln), are central to photonic technologies due to sharp intra&#8208;4f transitions, long lifetimes, and host&#8208;insensitive emission. However, modeling REIs remains challenging due to localized 4f orbitals, strong electron correlation, and multiplet structures. This review summarizes atomistic modeling strategies combining quantum chemistry and machine learning (ML). Traditional methods, DFT+, hybrid functionals (HSE06), , and DMFT, are benchmarked; for example, hybrid DFT reproduces 4f&#8211;5d gaps in Ce:YAG within 0.1&#8211;0.2 eV. Wavefunction methods like CASSCF and CASPT2 capture Stark splittings and transition strengths in Eu:Y SiO. ML models trained on DFT data predict bandgaps with 0.2 eV error and aid inverse design of Ce&#8208;doped phosphors with 505 nm emission and 60% retention at 640 K. Unlike prior reviews, this work bridges high&#8208;level quantum modeling with ML&#8208;driven screening across key applications: upconversion (Yb&#8211;Er:NaYF), lasers (Nd:YAG), quantum memories (Pr:Y SiO), and sensors (SrAl O:Eu, Dy). Covering over 20 REI&#8211;host systems, it integrates insights from DFT, Monte Carlo, MD, and ML potentials. The review thus provides both a methodological guide and a resource for designing next&#8208;generation REI&#8208;based photonic materials.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are a promising technology for large-scale hydrogen production, yet their industrial deployment is hindered by the harsh acidic conditions and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in iridium-based electrocatalysts (IBEs), emphasizing novel optimization strategies to enhance both catalytic activity and durability. Specifically, we critically examine the mechanistic insights into OER under acidic conditions, revealing key degradation pathways of Ir species. We further highlight innovative approaches for IBE design, including (i) morphology and support engineering to improve stability, (ii) structure and phase modulation to enhance catalytic efficiency, and (iii) electronic structure tuning for optimizing interactions with reaction intermediates. Additionally, we assess emerging electrode engineering strategies and explore the potential of non-precious metal-based alternatives. Finally, we propose future research directions, focusing on rational catalyst design, mechanistic clarity, and scalable fabrication for industrial applications. By integrating these insights, this review provides a strategic framework for advancing PEMWE technology through highly efficient and durable OER catalysts. Graphical Abstract In order to realize the efficient application of the industrial PEMWEs, material design strategies for stimulating the activity and stability capability of OER electrocatalysts are summarized, including (i) morphology/support effects, (ii) structure/phase engineering, (iii) electronic configuration/interaction. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism is deeply clarified, and electrode engineering and challenges of IBEs in practical PEMWE application are focused.</description>

                Abstract Platinum and non&#8208;precious metal (PtM) alloy multimetallic catalysts have been developed to address the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathodes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, these catalysts inevitably suffer from poor lot&#8208;to&#8208;lot consistency of chemical compositions and structures during production, and the transition metal leaching in practical applications. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance monometallic Pt catalysts using innovative nanoarchitectures has become important to address the technical challenges that hinder the widespread deployment of the PEMFCs. Here, a monometallic Pt catalyst is developed, which composes of self&#8208;hole&#8208;confined Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;anchored Pt single&#8208;atoms. The monometallic Pt catalyst exhibits high ORR activity and durability, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multimetallic PtM alloy catalysts. A membrane electrode assembly utilizing the monometallic Pt catalyst as a cathode demonstrated a mass activity of 0.87 A mg Pt &#8722;1 @ 0.9 V iR&#8208;free . After undergoing 30000 square&#8208;wave cycles, the assembly exhibited a 23% decline in mass activity and a potential drop of 16 mV at 0.8 A cm &#8722;2 . The results of this study would lead to a critical breakthrough in the performance of monometallic Pt catalysts utilized in PEMFCs.</description>

                The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis lead to high overpotentials, limiting cost-effective green hydrogen production. Ni-based catalysts, recognized as promising OER electrocatalysts, require electronic structure modulation to enhance performance. However, under oxidizing conditions, Ni-based materials undergo surface reconstruction with significant electronic alterations, rendering bulk-phase studies less practical. Recent efforts focus on regulating reconstructed surface electronic structures for improved efficiency, underscoring the need for a systematic review on this critical topic. This review highlights the fundamental progress regarding the electronic structure regulation of reconstructed surface of Ni-based OER electrocatalysts for better understanding the surface reconstruction process and the structure-activity relationship, including the basic understanding of OER mechanism and surface reconstruction of Ni-based materials, the principles and practical applications of key electronic structure descriptors with their respective advantages and limitations, and recent advancements and developing bottle-necks in surface reconstruction chemistry across diverse Ni-based OER catalyst systems. Finally, the challenges facing surface reconstruction of Ni-based OER catalysts are summarized, and several future prospects are proposed to guide the in-depth analysis of the reconstruction mechanism and the rational design of Ni-based OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Correction to the Adsorption Free Energy of Oxygen-Containing Intermediates on Pt(111) by Machine-Learned Force Field-Based Thermodynamic Integrations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c03465</link>
      <description>Thanh-Nam Huynh, Bassim Mounssef, Dmitry Sharapa, Felix Studt, Tom&#225;&#353; Bu&#269;ko, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414039479

                Accurate and efficient descriptions of adsorption free energy are of fundamental importance to bringing theoretical findings closer to experiments. The present study introduced a robust combination of machine learning and (un)constrained molecular dynamics-based &#955;-path thermodynamic integration methods to accurately estimate the anharmonic correction to the free energy of adsorbing systems and, thus, the adsorption free energy. The approach was demonstrated for the adsorptions of the oxygenated species exhibiting different anharmonic behaviors, namely, atomic oxygen (O), hydroxyl (OH), and hydroperoxyl (OOH), on the Pt(111) surface. The corrected adsorption free energies reveal the significant influence of anharmonic effects, which could account for up to 39% of the entropy loss estimated by the conventional harmonic approximation, even at near room temperature. This highlights the limitations of the current harmonic approximation and underscores the need to account for anharmonicity for better descriptions of the adsorption processes. The present method paves the way for the accurate adsorption of free energy calculations to be performed routinely toward more powerful theoretical predictions of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.</description>

      <title>Oxophilic Sites Mediated Dynamic Oxygen Replenishment to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen Catalysis in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c09939</link>

                Developing efficient and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is essential for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, catalyst instability caused by lattice oxygen (OL) depletion and metal dissolution remains a critical barrier. Here, we propose an oxophilic-site-mediated dynamic oxygen replenishment mechanism (DORM), in which OL actively participates in O-O bond formation and is continuously refilled by water-derived species. Oxophilic dopants modulate the local electronic structure, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy healing, and reorganize the interfacial hydrogen-bond network to enhance water mobility, orientation, and proton accessibility, collectively promoting water dissociation and stabilizing OL catalysis. The optimized catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 289 mV and exceptional durability, operating continuously for 650 h at 10 mA cm-2 in acidic electrolyte and maintaining stable performance for 280 h at 1 A cm-2 in a PEMWE. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for dynamic OL redox and provides a rational strategy for designing robust, noble-metal-free acidic OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Mars&#8211;van Krevelen Mechanism for CO Capture on the Surface of Carbides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30173637</link>

                Electrochemical reduction processes enable the CO to be converted into a useful chemical fuel. Our study employs density functional theory calculations to analyze the (110) facets of the transition metal carbide surfaces for CO capture, incorporating the Mars&#8211;van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. All the possible adsorption sites on the surface, including carbon, metal, and bridge sites, were fully investigated. The findings indicate that the carbon site is more active relative to the other adsorption sites examined. The CO hydrogenation paths have been comprehensively investigated on all the surfaces, and the free energy diagrams have been constructed towards the product. The results conclude that the TiC is the most promising candidate for the formation of methane, exhibiting an onset potential of &#8722;0.44 V. The predicted onset potential for CrC, MoC, NbC, VC, WC, ZrC, and HfC are &#8722;0.86, &#8722;0.61, &#8722;0.61, &#8722;0.93, &#8722;0.87, &#8722;0.61, and &#8722;0.81 V, respectively. Our calculated results demonstrate that MvK is selectively relevant to methane synthesis. Additionally, we investigated the stability of these surfaces against decomposition and conversion to pure metals concerning thermodynamics and kinetics. It was found that these carbides could remain stable under ambient conditions. The exergonic adsorption of hydrogen on carbon sites, requiring smaller potential values for product formation, and stability against decomposition indicate that these surfaces are highly suitable for CO reduction reactions using the MvK mechanism.</description>

      <title>Surface Science: The Foundation of Electrocatalysis</title>

                The research community in the electrochemical field is increasingly moving toward device-level investigations in a push to demonstrate practical applicability and widen the adoption of advanced energy conversion and storage technologies. Electrochemical devices, however, are highly complex systems and require a multidisciplinary approach to reveal the fundamental processes and key physical parameters of the materials employed that determine their functional properties. These processes occur in the near-surface region of the electrodes that catalyze electrochemical reactions. Here, we present our view on the critical importance and enduring relevance of a surface science approach to advance knowledge in electrocatalysis, with foundations built on well-defined planar surfaces that could be linked to corresponding nanostructured interfaces.</description>

      <title>Strong Trapping Capability and Diffusion Suppression Effect of Silicon Carbide Surface on Tritium: A First Principle Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c10266</link>
      <description>Ziling Zhou, Zhengzhe Qu, Mengjie Wu, Yu Wang, Feng Xie, Jiejuan Tong, Yanwei Wen, Bin Shan, Feng Xie, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414070079

                Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted considerable interest for use in electronics, aerospace, and nuclear energy applications owing to its excellent electrical and mechanical properties. In the nuclear industry, SiC serves as an effective tritium permeation barrier. However, a significant discrepancy remains between the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients and the theoretical predictions. In addition, a steep tritium concentration gradient exists near the surface, whereas the concentration remains nearly uniform through the bulk, a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood. In this study, first-principles calculations were performed to investigate the influences of vacancies, grain boundaries, and surfaces on tritium diffusion in 3C-SiC. Vacancies and grain boundaries were found to have a negligible impact on the effective diffusion coefficient. In contrast, the surface exhibited a high diffusion barrier, demonstrating a strong tritium-trapping behavior. Incorporation of the surface effect into a multilayer diffusion model resulted in good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results, while also explaining the observed steep concentration gradient near the surface. These findings enhance the fundamental understanding of the tritium behavior in SiC and provide theoretical guidance for the design of high-performance tritium permeation barrier materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Halide Perovskites: An Emerging Electrocatalyst for Oxygen and Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202500713</link>

                Abstract Halide perovskites are a significant class of compounds with ABX 3 crystal structure and have shown remarkable potential in renewable energy applications such as supercapacitors, photocatalysis, and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Their efficient charge carrier mobility, superior optoelectronic properties derived from optimal bandgap and tunable composition are beneficial for the applications of halide perovskites in the sustainable energy conversion and storage field. This review highlights the inherent potential of halide perovskites as electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the bottlenecks for sustainable water splitting reactions, for fuel cells, metal&#8208;air batteries, etc., which require electrocatalysts that offer good activity and excellent stability. Though noble metal catalysts offer thriving performance, their cost and stability&#8208;related issues hinder their widespread usage. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based perovskite oxide has already established its stronghold in electrocatalysis. Similarly, their halogen counterpart, perovskite halides, also prove to be efficient contenders for noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. In this review, various suitable synthesis techniques, mechanisms, and the electrocatalytic activity of halide perovskites are discussed. This review aims to show yet another class of compounds (halide perovskites) to the researcher community that strives for the development of noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Repurposing polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste to capture carbon dioxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adv5906</link>
      <description>Margarita Poderyte, R. J. S. Lima, Peter Illum Golb&#230;kdal, Dennis Wilkens Juhl, Kasper V. Olesen, Niels Chr. Nielsen, Arianna Lanza, Jiwoong Lee, Science Advances. 11(36)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414010797

                Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a ubiquitous polymer with a lack of viable waste management solutions besides mechanical recycling, incineration, and landfilling. Herein, we demonstrate a chemical upcycling of PET waste into materials for CO2 capture via aminolysis. The aminolysis reaction products-a bis-aminoamide (BAETA) and oligomers-exhibit high CO2 capture capacity up to 3.4 moles per kilogram as a stand-alone organic solid material. BAETA shows strong chemisorption featuring high selectivity for CO2 capture from flue gas (5 to 20% CO2) and ambient air (~400 parts per million CO2) under humid conditions. Our thermally stable material (&gt;250&#176;C) enables CO2 capture at high temperatures (up to 170&#176;C) for multiple cycles. Scalability of the material production was demonstrated by performing aminolysis of untreated consumer waste PET of 1 kilogram. Our approach introduces a simple and straightforward solution that can address both plastic waste and carbon dioxide, offering a potential pathway toward net negative emissions.</description>
