                A bidirectional co-doping of transition metal Fe and post-transition metal Sn on WO3 photoanode via a facile one step flame-doping process demonstrates the challenging amelioration of both thermodynamic charge migration and surface catalytic kinetics, achieving high-efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reaction in a neutral pH. The direct flamethrower with rapid thermal flux effectively induces the bidirectional doping of Fe3+ and Sn4+ into WO3 without damaging its nanostructure and fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate. From the synergetic effect of the dual-metal doping, the photoinduced charge migration and the surface water oxidation kinetics are effectively ameliorated. As a result, the Fe/Sn co-doped WO3 photoanode shows significantly enhanced PEC response with 6.16-fold higher photocurrent density performance at 1.23 VRHE than bare WO3. This work highlights the facile metal atom co-doping method without affecting intrinsic properties of photoanode and substrate for boosting the PEC water splitting performance and solar fuel production.</description>

                The development of efficient photocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for coreduction of N2 and CO2 under ambient conditions represents a highly promising but still challenging strategy for sustainable urea synthesis. In this study, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we present a comprehensive descriptor strategy integrating geometric, electronic, and energetic factors to screen Cu-metal dual-atom photocatalysts (CuM/CeO2, where M = 27 transition metals) for urea synthesis. According to the screening of the catalyst stability, coadsorption capability of N2 and CO2, energy barriers of the rate-determining step (RDS), and urea desorption energies, CuMn/CeO2 emerged as the most promising candidate photocatalyst. Through comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Cu-Mn interatomic distance on catalytic performance, a robust volcano-type relationship was established between the energy barrier for the RDS and the formation free energy of the key intermediate NCON (&#916;GNCON). This relationship was found to be independent of the support examined in this study.</description>

      <title>Ring Contraction of Cyclooctatetraenes toward Non&#8208;Benzenoid Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Au(111)&#8208;Catalysis and Bulk Pyrolysis</title>

                Abstract The Au(111)&#8208;catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation of tetraphenylated diacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene ( DA&#8208;COT ) and tetraacenaphtho&#8208;cyclooctatetraene ( TA&#8208;COT ) was investigated and compared with their uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis. On Au(111), a strain&#8208;induced contraction of the central COT unit toward six&#8208;membered rings upon extrusion of alkynes occurred. For TA&#8208;COT , an alternative reaction pathway opened up due to the increased ring strain of the eliminated alkyne product. This pathway involved a rearrangement toward a non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing a sesquifulvalene core. Intermediates and (by&#8208;)products were observed by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), verifying the predicted reaction mechanism. Formation of [8]circulene derivatives was not observed. Uncatalyzed bulk pyrolysis only gave one ring contraction product, respectively, for both COT derivatives.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus-Driven Dual d-Band Harmonization for Reversible Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c03061</link>
      <description>Yiming Zhang, Lanling Zhao, Jun Wang, Yao Liu, Zidong Zhang, Wenwen Cai, Jizhen Ma, Jintao Zhang, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4411718410

                To develop effective electrocatalysts, the d-band center theory has been a reliable predictor of electrocatalytic activity in transition-metal-based catalysts. However, it fails to accurately describe magnetic systems influenced by spin polarization. Herein, phosphorus doping was introduced into cobalt diselenide on a hive-like carbon framework with nitrogen insertion (P-CoSe2@NC), which significantly enhances electrocatalytic performance for reversible CO2 conversion in an advanced Li-CO2 battery with specific capacities around 17,000 mAh g-1, high-rate performance, and good longevity exceeding 600 h in a pouch cell. Phosphorus doping induces lattice torsion in CoSe2, leading to strain-caused changes in the d-band center across different crystal planes, which are linked with the redistribution of spin states. To address the limitations of the traditional single d-band center model, the dual center model reveals how phosphorus doping effectively harmonizes the competition between spin orbitals, originating from changes in higher spin states. Such equilibrium moderates interactions with electrochemical intermediates to lower reaction energy barriers, enhancing reversible electrocatalysis for Li-CO2 batteries. Therefore, strain-induced changes in the d-band centers, coupled with alterations in spin states, underline the enhanced electrocatalytic performance observed. This work provides novel insights into regulating bifunctional electrocatalytic activities in spin-polarized systems through a dual d-band center approach, utilizing nonmetal doping to optimize performance.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Potency of Boron Doping on Graphene Nanoclusters as Catalysts for CO Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/slct.202500613</link>
      <description>Arikasuci Fitonna Ridassepri, Yutaro Umejima, Shota Sato, I Gusti Made Sanjaya, Nur Hayati, Samik Samik, Jun Nakamura, ChemistrySelect. 10(25)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4411724277

                Abstract Graphene materials exhibit significant potential as electrocatalysts for the CO reduction reaction (CORR), a crucial process for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the impact of boron (B) doping on the catalytic performance of graphene nanoclusters (GNCs) for CORR using density functional theory (DFT). Pristine GNC (C 54 H 18 ) and B&#8208;doped GNC (C 53 H 18 B) were examined through the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. The results demonstrate that B doping slightly enhances adsorption energy, with C 53 H 18 B exhibiting higher adsorption energy (&#8722;2.40 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 eV) than C 54 H 18 (&#8722;0.79 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 eV), indicating a modest improvement in interaction strength, which is attributed to the electron&#8208;deficient sites introduced by the B atom, which strengthen CO&#8208;surface interactions, as evidenced by a shorter distance of 3.62 &#197; in C 53 H 18 B compared to 3.92 &#197; in C 54 H 18 . Free energy diagrams for both models reveal that methanol formation follows the same pathway: *CO &#8594; *CHO &#8594; *CH 2 O&#8594; *OCH 3 &#8594;CH 3 OH. Notably, the overpotential required for spontaneous reaction is significantly lower for B&#8208;GNC (0.89 V) than for the pristine GNC (1.50 V), indicating that B doping effectively enhances the electrocatalytic activity of GNCs for CORR. These findings highlight that B&#8208;GNC is a promising candidate for metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts with improved performance for sustainable COR applications.</description>

      <title>Multivalence Driven High-Entropy Bimetallic Oxides for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>

                High-entropy materials have recently attracted much attention in diverse fields due to their tailorable compositions and unpredictable physicochemical properties. Generally, five or more metal elements occupying the same lattice sites in similar proportions are considered as a prerequisite for achieving high configuration entropy. Here we report an uncommon type of such material in V-doped RuO2, where the number of metal elements is reduced to only two. Both Ru and V ions are found in mixed oxidation states, which endow the bimetallic oxides with five different cations. Each of these cations behaves as an individual species to contribute to the configuration entropy, which is high enough to stabilize the single phase near the half-doping level. The large ionic disorder in this high-entropy oxide leads to lattice distortion, grain refining, and an evolution from metal to semiconductor, making it a superior electrochemical catalyst toward acidic water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract Molecular self&#8208;assembly strategy for Pt&#8208;O electrocatalysts is presented, achieved by facile solution processing of dopamine monomers. This mussel&#8208;inspired strategy ensures a highly defined PtO 4 atomic structure with uniform monolayer deposition across various 2D nanomaterials. By leveraging the intimate interplay between PtO 4 sites and 2D substrates, while maintaining a consistent coordination environment, underlying mechanism for enhanced kinetics in interfacial synergistic hydrogen evolution reaction is systematically elucidated. Notably, the self&#8208;assembled PtO 4 site exhibits up to a 30&#8208;fold enhancement of mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts, contingent upon the choice of substrate material. Theoretical investigation illustrates facilitated electron transfer, optimized energy barriers, and additional reaction pathways resulting from the synergistic interplay between PtO 4 and Ti 3 C 2 O 2 MXene. This straightforward, energy&#8208;efficient, and highly reliable scheme for atomic&#8208;level catalysts prospects a valuable platform toward sub&#8208;molecular level engineering of tailored electronic structures and properties.</description>

      <title>Benchmark of Approximate Quantum Chemical and Machine Learning Potentials for Biochemical Proton Transfer Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00690</link>
      <description>Guilherme M. Arantes, Jan &#344;ez&#225;&#269;, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4411792069

                Proton transfer reactions are among the most common chemical transformations and are central to enzymatic catalysis and bioenergetic processes. Their mechanisms are often investigated using DFT or approximate quantum chemical methods, whose accuracy directly impacts the reliability of the simulations. Here, a comprehensive set of semiempirical molecular orbital and tight-binding DFT approaches, along with recently developed machine learning (ML) potentials, are benchmarked against high-level MP2 reference data for a curated set of proton transfer reactions representative of biochemical systems. Relative energies, geometries, and dipole moments are evaluated for isolated reactions. Microsolvated reactions are also simulated using a hybrid QM/MM partition. Traditional DFT methods offer high accuracy in general but show markedly larger deviations for proton transfers involving nitrogen-containing groups. Among approximate models, RM1, PM6, PM7, DFTB2-NH, DFTB3, and GFN2-xTB show reasonable accuracy across properties, though their performance varies by chemical group. The ML-corrected (&#916;-learning) model PM6-ML improves accuracy for all properties and chemical groups and transfers well to QM/MM simulations. Conversely, standalone ML potentials perform poorly for most reactions. These results provide a basis for evaluating approximate methods and selecting potentials for proton transfer simulations in complex environments.</description>

                Abstract Water electrolysis is a more sustainable way to produce green hydrogen than steam methanol reforming or coal gasification. Its efficiency is limited by slow oxygen evolution processes at the anode. Highly effective anodic electrocatalysts are difficult to produce. Layered double hydroxide is a promising and thoroughly researched OER material, however, long&#8208;term stability issues arise. In this study, we examine the modification of the electronic structure of NiMn LDH through the introduction of Ce doping. The analysis of the material using XPS and XRD indicates that Ce is effectively integrated into the NiMn crystal structure, resulting in lattice distortion and alterations to the electronic structure when doped at concentrations of up to 5%. Furthermore, various electrochemical characterizations indicated that Ce doping increased the number of electrochemically active sites, improved electronic conductivity, and optimized the electrochemical kinetics. The 5% Ce&#8208;doped NiMn LDH demonstrated a current density of 30 mA/cm 2 at an overpotential of 561 mV, which is significantly lower than the 638 mV overpotential observed for NiMn LDH and considerably superior to that of commercial RuO 2 . The system exhibited complete stability throughout a 15&#8208;h operational duration at a consistent applied current density of 15 mA/cm 2 , with no indications of degradation observed.</description>

      <title>Model-based Operability and Safety Optimization for PEM Water Electrolysis</title>

                In this paper, we present a systematic approach to quantify the safe operating window of a proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system considering energy intermittency and varying hydrogen demand. The PEMWE model has been developed based on first principles, with the polarization curve validated against a lab-scale experimental setup. The impact of key operational variables is investigated which include voltage, inlet temperature, and water flowrate (utilized for both feed and system cooling). Emphasis is given on operating temperature, a safety-critical variable, as its elevation can pose significant hydrogen safety risks within both the electrolyzer cells and the storage system. The impact of temperature on process safety is quantified via a risk index considering the fault probability and consequence severity. Process operability analysis is employed to assess the achievability of a safe and feasible region for design and operations. This analysis provides a comprehensive framework to optimize PEMWE systems for enhanced operational flexibility and robust performance with application to modular hydrogen production using renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Cyclic Steady-State Simulation of Dynamic Catalysis Systems: Application to Ammonia Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.69997/sct.105384</link>
      <description>Carolina Colombo Tedesco, John R. Kitchin, Carl D. Laird, Systems and Control Transactions. 4(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4411816096

                Dynamic or Programmable Catalysis is an innovative strategy to improve heterogeneous catalysis processes by modulating the binding energies (BE) of adsorbates on a catalytic surface. The technique enables the periodic favoring of different reaction steps, overcoming limitations imposed by the Sabatier Principle and allowing for higher overall reaction rates, otherwise unattainable. Previously, we implemented a simultaneous simulation approach using the algebraic modeling language Pyomo and the solver IPOPT to obtain cyclic steady state results for a unimolecular reactive system with up to four-order of magnitude increases in computational performance compared to the previously reported sequential approach. The flexibility of the method allowed for the investigation of the influence of forcing signal parameters on system behavior and provided a framework for waveform design. In this study, we use a hybrid framework that combines the sequential and the simultaneous simulation approaches to find the cyclic steady state of a more complex system, of ammonia synthesis, comprising 19 reversible elementary reaction steps. The framework allowed us to investigate sine wave parameters with approximately 220 times less computational effort compared to the sequential approach alone. With the parameters studied, our findings indicate that frequencies exceeding 1000 Hz and compressive strains greater than 2% can negatively impact the system performance. Future work will focus on expanding the model to include lateral interactions between molecules, using other waveform as forcing signals, and integrating systematic mathematical optimization approaches. These advancements pave the way to establishing a general framework for identifying optimal waveforms across diverse dynamic catalysis systems.</description>
