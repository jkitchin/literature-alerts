                Abstract The dissolution and inactivation of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts remain significant barriers to the development of acidic water electrolysis. Here, the activity and stability of BaIrO 3 (BIO) perovskite are enhanced through the controlled regulation of metal&#8208;oxygen octahedra via B&#8208;site substitution with Co (BICO). During OER process, the dissolution of Ba and Co leads to the formation of highly active IrCoO x nanoparticles on the amorphous surface layers of BICO. The introduction of Co not only increases the concentration of high&#8208;valence Ir species with high activity but also prevents the excessive oxidation and dissolution of Ir by taking over its oxidation role during the reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal a substantial reduction in the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) after Co doping. BICO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance, requiring an overpotential of 216 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , while maintaining continuous operation for over 140 h without significant degradation, and boasting a stability number (S&#8208;number) of 4.3 &#215; 10 5 . Additionally, BICO&#8208;2 exhibits excellent activity and durability in proton exchange membranes (PEM) water electrolysis. This work introduces a novel approach for designing and fabricating efficient, long&#8208;lasting electrocatalysts, offering significant insights for advancing acidic water electrolysis technologies.</description>

      <title>Oxidation of interfacial cobalt controls the pH dependence of the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-025-01784-1</link>
      <description>Jinzhen Huang, Adam H. Clark, Natasha Hales, Kenneth Crossley, Julie Guehl, Radim Skoup&#253;, Thomas J. Schmidt, Emiliana Fabbri, Nature Chemistry. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4408934714

                Transition metal oxides often undergo dynamic surface reconstruction under oxygen evolution reaction conditions to form the active state, which differs in response to the electrolyte pH. The resulting pH dependency of catalytic activity is commonly observed but poorly understood. Herein we track Co oxidation state changes at different pH-directed (hydr)oxide/electrolyte interfaces using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterizations. Combined with in situ electrochemical analyses, we establish correlations between Co redox dynamics, the flat band potential and Co oxidation state changes to explain the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution activity. Alkaline environments provide a low flat band potential that yields a low-potential Co redox transformation, which favours surface reconstruction. Neutral and acidic environments afford an anodic shift of the Co redox transformation that increases the catalytic overpotential. The larger overpotential in neutral environments is attributable to poor Co atom polarizability and slow Co oxidation state changes. These findings reveal that interfacial Co oxidation state changes directly determine the pH dependency of the oxygen evolution reaction activity.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Selectivity Differences of NO Electroreduction on Ag and Au Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c00656</link>

                Although noble metals Ag and Au have similar chemical reactivities, their catalytic selectivity for NO electroreduction is significantly different. Namely, hydroxylamine is often considerably produced on Ag while not observed on the Au electrode. In this study, first-principles calculations and the electric field controlling constant potential (EFC-CP) method are adopted to unveil the underlying reasons. We first reveal a distinct NO* adsorption configuration, vertical on Ag and inclined on Au, leading to different reduction pathways to NOH* and HNO*, respectively. Via complete electrochemical barrier calculations and detailed kinetic analysis, we find the hydroxylamine selectivity difference between Ag and Au is mainly induced by adsorption strength of NH2OH*. On Ag, the obtained NH2OH* prefers to desorb and produce hydroxylamine, while NH2OH* is bonded strongly to Au and favors further reduction to ammonia. The study advances our understanding of factors regulating product selectivity, providing crucial insights for designing NO electroreduction catalysts toward hydroxylamine production.</description>

                Developing efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for the continuous activation of oxidants is crucial to mitigating the global water resource crisis. Guided by computational predictions, this research achieved this goal through the synthesis of a modified graphitic carbon nitride with enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Its intrinsic activity was further amplified by dynamic in-situ reconstruction using the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator system during photoreactions. Impressively, this reconstructed catalyst demonstrated the capability for at least 30 regeneration cycles while maintaining high purification efficacy. The mechanism underlying the in-situ reconstruction of active sites for periodate functionalization was elucidated through theoretical calculations, coupled with semi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical analyses. The system's capacity to detoxify recalcitrant pollutants was demonstrated through successful Escherichia coli cultivation and Zebrafish embryo experiments. The economic feasibility and environmental impacts are quantitatively assessed by the Electrical Energy per Order (EE/O) metric and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), confirming the system's scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios. This dual-site constrained interlayer insertion, and controllable in-situ catalyst reconstruction achieve durable robustness of the photocatalyst, paving the way for the development of sustainable catalytic water purification technologies. Efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for sustained oxidant activation are vital for solving the global water crisis but elusive. Here, the authors explore the in situ dynamic reconstruction of graphitic carbon nitride photocatalysts with iodine redox mediators, to develop a solar-driven Fenton-like system that activates periodate for effective and sustainable wastewater regeneration.</description>

                Abstract The stability and electronic properties of 2&#8208;D conducting metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in their potential applications in energy&#8208;related processes. In this study, The structural stability and electronic characteristics of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt) are systematically investigated using first&#8208;principles calculations. Formation energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm the excellent thermodynamic and thermal stability of these frameworks. Additionally, density of states (DOS) analysis reveals that nine of these structures exhibit high electrical conductivity, making them promising for electronic and electrocatalytic applications. To further understand their electronic structure, the d &#8208;band center and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) are analyzed, providing insight into the bonding characteristics and electronic interactions within the frameworks. Moreover, the catalytic performance of the conductive MOFs is evaluated as multifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This study highlights the robust stability and tunable electronic properties of M 3 (C 6 Se 6 ), serving as a foundation for future investigations into their functional applications in energy conversion and storage technologies.</description>

                Abstract The primary hurdle faced in the practical application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) involves improving the intrinsic kinetic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts while concurrently enhancing their durability. Although electrocatalysts based on lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) have the potential to significantly enhance the activity in OER without being restricted by scaling relationships, they are neglected in acidic electrolytes due to limited durability. In this study, an innovative approach is presented to simultaneously promote the activation of lattice oxygen and improve the durability of LOM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts by incorporating d 0 metal ions into the RuO 2 electrocatalyst. Leveraging the unique electronic properties of the d 0 metal ion, the O 2p band center and Ru&#8208;O covalency of the electrocatalyst are successfully engineered, resulting in the change in OER mechanism. Furthermore, in a single cell of PEMWE, the LOM&#8208;based electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving 3.0 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.81 V and maintaining durability for 100 h at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , surpassing commercial RuO 2 . This innovative strategy challenges the traditional viewpoint that suppressing lattice oxygen activation in OER is essential for enhancing PEMWE durability, offering new perspectives for the development of OER electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes.</description>

                Designing efficient ligand-free heterogeneous catalysts for ethylene hydroformylation to produce C3 oxygenates is of importance for both fundamental research and practical applications, but it is often hindered by insufficient catalytic activity and selectivity. This work designs isolated rhodium-cobalt (Rh-Co) sites confined within a ZSM-5 zeolite to enhance ethylene hydroformylation rates and selectivity while maintaining catalyst stability. By adjusting the Co/Al ratio in Co-ZSM-5, different sizes of Co are formed; subsequent Rh introduction produces isolated Rh1Cox clusters with different Rh-Co coordination numbers (CNs). In-situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that a Rh-Co CN of 3, corresponding to an isolated Rh1Co3 site, provides optimal bindings to reaction intermediates and thus achieves the highest hydroformylation rates among supported Rh-based catalysts. This study demonstrates the role of coordination-tuning via a secondary metal in effectively controlling the reaction pathway over single Rh atom catalysts.</description>

                Coal resources, due to their cheapness and high-energy density, are widely used in large quantities, causing greenhouse gas emissions in turn, and thus need to be utilized in a resourceful way to reduce carbon emissions. Herein, we designed an alternative route of value-added utilization using coal-based activated carbon support loaded with Fe nanoparticles for CO2 hydrogenation to liquid fuels. The coal-based derived carbon support with tunable structure, elemental composition, defects, and special surface area controlled by a proposed two-step coking-activation strategy, in which special scale-like or alveolate structures were obtained. It was demonstrated by characterization that the structure and defect of the carbon support affect the carburization behavior of iron species, and then the highest Fe5C2 content was found on FeK@AC-2.0-750 catalyst. The high level of exposure of active &#967;-Fe5C2 sites presents benign liquid fuel selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and DFT calculation further support the improved carbon chain propagation over &#967;-Fe5C2 rather than &#952;-Fe3C. Compared with commercial carbon supports, its loaded Fe-based catalyst has a better performance with 29.3% CO2 conversion and 58.8% C5+ selectivity, respectively. These results provide new insights into the development of novel nanocarbons and the efficient utilization of coal-based resources as well as broaden the design of efficient iron-based catalysts for C1 chemistry.</description>

                The electrochemical synthesis of commodity chemicals such as epoxides and glycols offers a sustainable alternative to conventional methods that involve hazardous chemicals. Efforts to improve the yield and selectivity of propylene oxidation using Pd-based catalysts have been shown to be highly sensitive to applied potential, pH, and electrochemical cell design. Record efficiencies and yields were obtained by substitution of PdO by 4d or 5d transition metals, including Pt, with thus far little rationale regarding the origin for the improvement. Through electrochemical analysis, scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we investigated the mechanism of propylene oxidation on Pd-based catalysts. We demonstrate that adsorbates forming on PdO, where Pd adopts a square-planar coordination [PdO4], differ from that forming on the surface of oxidized metallic Pd catalysts with an oxo intermediate mediating propylene oxidation on PdO. We further show that Pt substitution in PdO does not modify this oxo intermediate. Varying pH, we found that the onset for propylene oxidation is pH independent, indicating a potential-determining step where the proton is not involved in and similar reaction pathway in acidic and near-neutral conditions. Finally, our work undoubtedly demonstrates that high Faradaic efficiency toward propylene glycol and propylene oxide formation, such as those previously reported in the literature, can be achieved by means of electrode engineering and mastery of mass transport and local pH. Notably, we achieved &#8776;100% faradaic efficiency for propylene glycol at 1.7 V vs RHE in acidic media using a Pt-substituted PdO catalyst loaded onto a gas diffusion electrode.</description>

                Unveiling structure-activity correlations at the sub-nanoscale remains an essential challenge in catalysis science. During electrocatalysis, dynamic structural evolution drives the ambiguous entanglement of crystals and electrons degrees of freedom that obscure the activity origin. Here, we track the structural evolution of Ni-based model pre-catalysts (Ni(OH)2, NiS2, NiSe2, NiTe), detailing their catalytically active state during water oxidation via operando techniques and theoretical calculations. We reveal the sub-nanometric structural difference of NiO6 unit with a regular distortion in the reconstructed active phase NiOOH, codetermined by the geometric (bond lengths) and electronic (covalency) structure of the pre-catalysts on both spatial and temporal scales. The symmetry-broken active units induce the delicate balance of the p and d orbitals in NiOOH, further steering the modulation of catalytic intermediate configurations and mechanisms, with improved performance. This work recognizes the fine structural differences of the active phases from the sub-nanometer scale, and quantitatively explains their influence on activity. Our findings provide a more intuitive design framework for high-efficiency materials through targeted symmetry engineering of active units. Unveiling structure-activity correlations is essential in catalysis science. Here, the authors report the structural evolution of Ni-based pre-catalysts during the reaction and demonstrate how sub-nanometric variations affect catalytic performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction.</description>

      <title>Toward improved descriptors by refining the complex reaction network in electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0255158</link>
      <description>Lu Han, Huan Li, Jun Long, Hao Li, Jianping Xiao, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(13)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409038379

                Electrocatalysis is one of the key technologies for developing sustainable and fossil resource free routes to produce fuels and chemicals. The limiting potential (UL), defined by the reaction free energy of the most difficult electrochemical step in a given pathway, is an effective descriptor for establishing the activity trend of a set of electrocatalysts, allowing high throughput screening of new catalysts. However, the reaction network of electrocatalytic processes is rather complex, especially for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps, e.g., the synthesis of valuable C&#8211;N bond-containing chemicals. Thermochemical steps cannot be significantly enhanced by electrode potentials, where kinetics is a non-negligible issue at even high overpotentials. This makes it challenge by using limiting potential to accurately describe activity trends for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps. To this end, we propose an effective scheme to determine an improved descriptor. We suggest refining the rather complex reaction network at first. In particular, it is suggested to decouple electro- and thermochemical steps and exclude the unfavorable pathways with an excessively high thermochemical barrier. Then, a global comparison among the other pathways can be made, to determine the optimal pathway and the improved descriptor (the reaction free energy of the most difficult step of the optimal pathway, defined as &#916;GrRPD-limiting). In addition, the studies on reaction kinetics are also suggested to understand the exception of the best catalysts and provide the direction of experimental optimization. This scheme is of a great compromise between practical efficiency and the accuracy toward the rational design of electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Surface strain hampers dissociation and induces curious rotational-alignment effect for HCl on the Au/Cu(111) alloy surface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0260125</link>
      <description>Tianhui Liu, Bina Fu, Dong H. Zhang, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(13)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409038844

                We present the first six-dimensional quantum dynamics study of HCl on a strained pseudomorphic monolayer of Au deposited on a Cu(111) substrate, utilizing a newly developed machine learning-based potential energy surface. The strain in the surface lattice, resulting from a 12.62% compression of the Au monolayer, induces a significant high barrier height (1.81 eV) and a tight saddle point. These effects lead to a marked suppression of the reactivity of ground-state HCl (v = 0) on Au/Cu(111), while the dissociation probability of vibrationally excited (v = 1) HCl increases substantially. As a result, the vibrational efficiency is notably higher compared to those for HCl on pure Au(111) and alloyed Au/Ag(111) surfaces. In addition, the surface strain induces a distinctive rotational alignment effect in the title reaction, where for HCl in the (v = 0, j) states, dissociation is most favorable when an HCl molecule collides with its rotation perpendicular to the Au/Cu(111) surface (the cartwheel alignment). In contrast, for HCl in the (v = 1, j) states, the opposite (helicopter) alignment is preferred. This leads to a pronounced difference in the effects of rotational excitation, depending on whether HCl is initially in the ground or excited vibrational state.</description>

      <title>Porous Antimony Tin Oxide with a Particle Assembly Structure as an IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Support for an Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c00875</link>

                Proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds great promise for hydrogen production applications. However, the reliance of PEMWE membrane electrodes on high loadings of expensive iridium poses a significant barrier to their commercial viability. Therefore, the development of high-performance oxygen evolution catalysts with a low iridium content is of critical importance. In this research, a porous antimony tin oxide (ATO) conductive support with a particle assembly aggregate structure was fabricated by a carbon template removal method. ATO-supported IrO2 exhibits significantly improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a much lower overpotential compared to the unsupported IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, it achieves 1.8 V at 2 A cm-2 with an ultralow loading of iridium (0.3 mgIr cm-2) for the proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer. Characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations have elucidated that the enhanced performance is attributed to the porous morphology of ATO and the strong metal oxide-support interaction between IrO2 and the ATO support. These findings validate the practicality of conductive nanostructured antimony-tin-oxide-supported catalysts for PEMWE applications and offer a pathway for the design of low-Ir OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective precious metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is key to realizing the economic viability of acidic water electrolysis. Herein, galvanic displacement is employed for in situ formation of bimetallic Pt/Ru deposits on H&#8208;intercalated TiO 2 nanotube arrays. It is found that a two&#8208;step procedure yields polydisperse deposits with a dominant fraction of Ru nanoparticles coated with atomic and subnanometric Pt islands. These Pt|Ru nanointerfaces induce charge transfer from Pt to Ru, which modulates the electronic structure of Pt sites for accelerated HER kinetics. By varying the platinization time in the second step, a balance between the exposure of catalytically active Pt|Ru nanointerfaces and the total number of Pt surface sites is achieved. The optimized composite, termed Ru&#8208;30min@Pt&#8208;30min, requires an overpotential of 58 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m HClO 4 and maintains performance stability and structure integrity under prolonged operation. Moreover, it presents a 3.5&#8208;fold increase in precious metal mass activity over Pt/C at &#951; = 80 mV. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronic interactions generated by Pt&#8208;modification of Ru and hydrogenated TiO 2 surfaces provide multiple active sites with improved H ads energetics compared to pure Pt and Ru.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Rich Selenide Monolayers as Metal-Free Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reactions: A First-Principles Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7020055</link>
      <description>Yao Xu, Fengyu Li, Chemistry. 7(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409092115

                Carbon-based materials have garnered significant attention for electrocatalysis applications in fuel cells due to their unique structural and electronic properties, but rapid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of fuel cells is challenging. Dopants are typically used as active sites for ORR, and increasing the number of active sites for carbon-based catalysts remains a challenge. Here, we carried out first-principles calculations for the electrocatalytic ORR performance of the recently reported monolayer superconductors of carbon-rich selenides. Remarkably, the abundant C atoms serve as the active centers instead of the foreign atoms (Se). All the free energy changes during the ORR process are downhill, suggesting that these carbon-rich selenides hold promise as metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR. Note that the promising electrocatalytic performance of carbon-rich selenides is theoretically predicted; validation is encouraged for experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Explainable classification of goat vocalizations using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318543</link>
      <description>Stavros Ntalampiras, Gabriele Pesando Gamacchio, PLoS ONE. 20(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409049727

                Efficient precision livestock farming relies on having timely access to data and information that accurately describes both the animals and their surrounding environment. This paper advances classification of goat vocalizations leveraging a publicly available dataset recorded at diverse farms breeding different species. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for classifying goat vocalizations, yielding an average classification rate of 95.8% in discriminating various goat emotional states. To this end, we suitably augmented the existing dataset using pitch shifting and time stretching techniques boosting the robustness of the trained model. After thoroughly demonstrating the superiority of the designed architecture over the contrasting approaches, we provide insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the proposed CNN by carrying out an extensive interpretation study. More specifically, we conducted an explainability analysis to identify the time-frequency content within goat vocalisations that significantly impacts the classification process. Such an XAI-driven validation not only provides transparency in the decision-making process of the CNN model but also sheds light on the acoustic features crucial for distinguishing the considered classes. Last but not least, the proposed solution encompasses an interactive scheme able to provide valuable information to animal scientists regarding the analysis performed by the model highlighting the distinctive components of the considered goat vocalizations. Our findings underline the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in bolstering classification accuracy and highlight the significance of leveraging XAI methodologies for validating and interpreting complex machine learning models applied to animal vocalizations.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Simulations of Skaergaardite (CuPd) with a Self-Consistent Hubbard U-Correction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7020056</link>
      <description>Martino Napoli, Assimo Maris, Chemistry. 7(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409091991

                The electronic and phonon bands of Skaergaardite are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO. Skaergaardite is a copper palladium mineral (CuPd) found in the Skaergaard intrusion with a CsCl-type (B2) structure. Due to its porous structure, it presents a large surface area available for interactions, which makes it a promising catalyst. The PBE-GGA functional with a Hubbard-like localized term (DFT+U) is combined with ultrasoft and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a conventional approach with a dense Monkhorst&#8211;Pack grid of k-points 12 &#215; 12 &#215; 12 is applied. The electronic valence bands are mainly constituted by 3d orbitals of Cu and 4d orbitals of Pd and a pseudo-gap can be recognized. With respect to DFT, DFT+U causes a general downward shift in the valence band. The acoustic and optical phonon branches are separated by a few cm&#8722;1 gap at about 150 cm&#8722;1 and show a density of state curve typical of ordered materials. These results highlight the reliability of DFT+U in studying bimetallic systems with scarce experimental benchmarks, offering insights into the behavior of Skaergaardite and its potential applications in material science such as reduction reactions and hydrogen storage.</description>
