      <title>Emergence of Z-Scheme Photocatalysis for Total Water Splitting: An Improvised Route to High Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c01162</link>
      <description>Atish Ghosh, Anup Pramanik, Sougata Pal, Pranab Sarkar, &#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399998814

                Photocatalytic water splitting to spontaneously produce H2 and O2 is a long-standing goal in solar energy conversion, presenting a significant challenge without using sacrificial electron donors or external biases. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, the design of artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic systems is at the forefront of this field. These systems achieve higher redox potential by separating photogenerated electrons and holes through a fast interlayer recombination process between valence and conduction band edges. Z-scheme photocatalysis involves using two different semiconductors with distinct bandgap energies. Here, we explore potential systems based on two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures composed of carbon, nitrogen, or similar main group elements. The advantages and disadvantages of these systems are discussed, with a focus on enhancing their efficiency through strategic design. Special emphasis is placed on the dynamics of excited charge carrier transfer and recombination processes, which are crucial for developing efficient photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting.</description>

      <title>Research progress of electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cnl2.152</link>
      <description>Youze Zeng, Xue Wang, Yang Hu, Wei Qi, Zheng Wang, Meiling Xiao, Changpeng Liu, Wei Xing, Jianguo Zhu, Carbon neutralization. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400000471

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have been hailed as a promising hydrogen energy technology due to high energy conversion efficiency, zero carbon emission and the potential independence on scare and expensive noble metal electrocatalysts. A variety of platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free catalysts has been developed with superior catalytic performance to noble metal benchmarks toward cathodic oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). However, PGM electrocatalysts still dominate the anodic catalyst research because the kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) are two or three orders of magnitude slower than in that acidic media. Therefore, it is urgently desirable to improve noble metal utilization efficiency and/or develop high&#8208;performance PGM&#8208;free electrocatalysts for HOR, thus promoting the real&#8208;world implementation of AEMFCs. In this review, the current research progress of electrocatalysts for HOR in alkaline media is summarized. We start with the discussion on the current HOR reaction mechanisms and existing controversies. Then, methodologies to improve the HOR performance are reviewed. Following these principles, the recently developed HOR electrocatalysts including PGM and PGM&#8208;free HOR electrocatalysts in alkaline media are systematically introduced. Finally, we put forward the challenges and prospects in the field of HOR catalysis.</description>

      <title>From 2e&#8722; to 4e&#8722; pathway in the alkaline oxygen reduction reaction on Au(100): Kinetic circumvention of the volcano curve</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0211477</link>
      <description>Yuke Li, Bing-Yu Liu, Yan&#8208;Xia Chen, Zhi-Feng Liu, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400006273

                We report the free energy barriers for the elementary reactions in the 2e&#8722; and 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) steps on Au(100) in an alkaline solution. Due to the weak adsorption energy of O2 on Au(100), the barrier for the association channel is very low, and the 2e&#8722; pathway is clearly favored, while the barrier for the O&#8211;O dissociation channel is significantly higher at 0.5 eV. Above 0.7 V reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the association channel becomes thermodynamically unfavorable, which opens up the O&#8211;O dissociation channel, leading to the 4e&#8722; pathway. The low adsorption energy of oxygenated species on Au is now an advantage, and residue ORR current can be observed up to the 1.0&#8211;1.2 V region (RHE). In contrast, the O&#8211;O dissociation barrier on Au(111) is significantly higher, at close to 0.9 eV, due to coupling with surface reorganization, which explains the lower ORR activity on Au(111) than that on Au(100). In combination with the previously suggested outer sphere electron transfer to O2 for its initial adsorption, these results provide a consistent explanation for the features in the experimentally measured polarization curve for the alkaline ORR on Au(100) and demonstrate an ORR mechanism distinct from that on Pt(111). It also highlights the importance to consider the spin state of O2 in ORR and to understand the activation barriers, in addition to the adsorption energies, to account for the features observed in electrochemical measurements.</description>

      <title>Engineering and Design of Halide Perovskite Photoelectrochemical Cells for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) use solar energy to generate green hydrogen by water splitting and have an integrated device structure. Achieving high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency along with a long operational lifetime in these cells is crucial for the production of low&#8208;cost green hydrogen as a viable energy source. Several functional components, such as photo absorber, charge transport, and catalyst layers are interfaced in these cells to form a compact monolithic device. In this review, therefore, the engineering and design of the individual components of these cells, the interplay between them, and their interfaces are discussed in detail, as these factors determine the overall performance of the cells. The main emphasis is on halide perovskite (HP) photo absorbers, which have emerged as promising materials for use in these cells due to their superior optoelectronic properties. Recent advances in the development of efficient and stable perovskite&#8208;based cells are highlighted and reviewed. The design of catalysts for water splitting and the effect of factors such as pH and supporting cations are also examined. Finally, the scientific challenges and future directions for designing perovskite&#8208;based photoelectrochemical cells are discussed. This review can help researchers further advance this technology toward commercial production of green hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of Pd clusters on N-doped Ag nanowires for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chphma.2024.06.004</link>

                Efficient and stable Pt-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are indispensable for future fuel cells. Herein, we describe a heterostructure of Pd nanocrystals (PdNCs) on N-doped Ag nanowires (NWs) synthesized using a direct epitaxial growth strategy with a Pd loading of only 9.5 wt.%. The PdAg bimetallic heterostructure showed the highest mass activity among reported PdAg-based ORR electrocatalysts and exhibited excellent stability, with only a 1.5 mV decay in the half-wave potential even after 20000 cycles of continuous testing. The remarkably enhanced activity and durability can be attributed to the distinct advantages of the ultrasmall PdNCs, cocatalysts of N-doped AgNWs, and their heterointerfaces. This work reveals that the epitaxial growth of a heterostructure on a stable support is a promising strategy for promoting catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of Electrochemical Double Layer Approximations on Electrokinetic Predictions: Case Study for CO Reduction on Copper</title>

                Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has been useful to electrocatalyst research, yet simulating the complexities of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface hinders progress in understanding reaction mechanisms and the underlying kinetics. Though many approaches to incorporating electrochemical double layer (EDL) features in DFT calculations have been developed, uncertainty in interfacial solvent properties and the distribution of ions leave the impact of the EDL on electrocatalytic kinetics unclear. Elucidating the sensitivity of DFT predictions to the EDL properties and model is crucial. Herein, we use an analytical Grand Canonical DFT framework (aGC-DFT) to quantify the sensitivity of potential-dependent activation energies to parameters of the EDL, incorporating a Helmholtz EDL model with varying dielectric constant (&#949;r) and EDL width (d). We compute the activation barriers for OC&#8211;H, CO&#8211;H, and OC&#8211;CO bond formation from CO* on Cu. These elementary reactions are critical within the heavily debated reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction and are likely to impact overall activity and product selectivity. We show the aGC-DFT method produces consistent results with explicit GC-DFT calculations, while enabling probing of the EDL model sensitivity at a much lower computational cost. Reaction steps with significant dipole moment changes (i.e., CO&#8211;H bond formation) are highly sensitive to the chosen EDL parameters, such that the relative barriers of the OC&#8211;H, CO&#8211;H, and OC&#8211;CO bond formation steps depend significantly on EDL properties. Without knowledge of the interfacial properties of the EDL, there is substantial uncertainty in activation barriers and elementary reaction rates within a DFT analysis of electrocatalytic kinetics.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin, large area &#946;-Ni(OH)2 crystalline nanosheet as bifunctional electrode material for charge storage and oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.06.167</link>
      <description>Sayali Ashok Patil, Pallavi B. Jagdale, Narad Barman, Asif Iqbal, Amanda Sfeir, S&#233;bastien Royer, Ranjit Thapa, Akshaya K. Samal, Manav Saxena, Journal of colloid and interface science. 674(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400036923

                Bifunctional electrode materials are highly desirable for meeting increasing global energy demands and mitigating environmental impact. However, improving the atom-efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of storage systems, as well as optimizing conversion processes to enhance overall energy utilization and sustainability, remains a significant challenge for their application. Herein, we devised an optimized, facile, economic, and scalable synthesis of large area (cm2), ultrathin (&#8764;2.9 &#177; 0.3 nm) electroactive nanosheet of &#946;-Ni(OH)2, which acted as bifunctional electrode material for charge storage and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The &#946;-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet electrode shows the volumetric capacity of 2.82 Ah.cm&#8722;3(0.82 &#181;Ah.cm&#8722;2) at the current density of 0.2 mA.cm&#8722;2. The device shows a high capacity of 820 mAh.cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 0.33 Wh.cm&#8722;3 at 275.86 W.cm&#8722;3 along with promising stability (30,000 cycles). Furthermore, the OER activity of ultrathin &#946;-Ni(OH)2 exhibits an overpotential (&#951;10) of 308 mV and a Tafel value of 42 mV dec-1 suggesting fast reaction kinetics. The mechanistic studies are enlightened through density functional theory (DFT), which reveals that additional electronic states near the Fermi level enhance activity for both capacitance and OER.</description>

      <title>Control Over Nitrogen Dopant Sites in Palladium Metallene for Manipulating Catalytic Activity and Stability in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract Doping light elements in Pt&#8208;group metals is an effective approach toward improving their catalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it is challenging to control dopant sites and to establish the correlation between the doping site and the catalytic property. In this paper, this success is demonstrated in controlling N doping sites in Pd metallene to manipulate electrocatalytic properties toward ORR. A Pd metallene sample with N dopant predominantly located at the atomic vacancy site (V&#8208;N&#8208;Pd metallene) exhibits two times higher mass activity in ORR than a Pd metallene sample with N dopant mainly occupied the interstitial site (I&#8208;N&#8208;Pd metallene). However, the I&#8208;N&#8208;Pd metallene shows improved durability than the V&#8208;N&#8208;Pd metallene, with only a 4 mV decay in half&#8208;wave potential after 20 000 cycles. Computational calculation results reveal that the significantly enhanced ORR activity of V&#8208;N&#8208;Pd metallene arises from the atomic vacancy&#8208;doped N, which modulates the electronic structure of Pd metallene to weaken the adsorption energy of intermediate O * species. This work provides guidelines for manipulating catalytic properties by controlling the doping sites of light elements in metal nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking water adsorption on metal surfaces with &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0205552</link>
      <description>Mian-Le Xu, Sihang Liu, Sudarshan Vijay, Thomas Bligaard, Georg Kastlunger, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400045624

                Solid&#8211;water interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and technology. In particular, technologies evolving in the green transition, such as electrocatalysis, heavily rely on the junction of an electrolyte and an electrode as a central part of the device. For the understanding of atomic-scale processes taking place at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface, density functional theory (DFT) has become the de facto standard. The validation of DFT&#8217;s ability to simulate the interfacial solid/water interaction is crucial, and ideal simulation setups need to be identified in order to prevent avoidable systematic errors. Here, we develop a rigorous sampling protocol for benchmarking the adsorption/desorption energetics of water on metallic surfaces against experimental temperature programmed desorption, single crystal adsorption calorimetry, and thermal energy atom scattering. We screened DFT&#8217;s quality on a series of transition metal surfaces, applying three of the most common exchange&#8211;correlation approximations: PBE-D3, RPBE-D3, and BEEF-vdW. We find that all three xc-functionals reflect the pseudo-zeroth order desorption of water rooted in the combination of attractive adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate interactions and their saturation at low and intermediate coverages, respectively. However, both RPBE-D3 and BEEF-vdW lead to more accurate water adsorption strengths, while PBE-D3 clearly overbinds near-surface water. We relate the variations in binding strength to specific variations in water&#8211;metal and water&#8211;water interactions, highlighting the structural consequences inherent in an uninformed choice of simulation parameters. Our study gives atomistic insight into water&#8217;s complex adsorption equilibrium. Furthermore, it represents a guideline for future DFT-based simulations of solvated solid interfaces by providing an assessment of systematic errors in specific setups.</description>

      <title>pH-dependent formation potential of OH&#8727; on Pt(111): Double layer effect on water dissociation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoms.2024.05.009</link>
      <description>Xue Wang, Jiaxin Zhu, Yongbo Kuang, Jun Cheng, Jia&#8208;Bo Le, Nano materials science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400045888

                The adsorption/desorption of OH&#8727; on electrode surfaces is pivotal in numerous electrocatalytic reactions. To understand the effect of electrolyte pH on that process, in this work, an advanced approach combining ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) with free energy perturbation is employed to calculate the dehydrogenation free energy of water chemisorbed at differently electrified Pt(111)/electrolyte interfaces. Our findings reveal that the onset potential for OH&#8727; formation shifts negatively as the pH increases at low pH condition (pH&lt;4.3), aligning with the cyclic voltammetry curves observed in experimental studies. It indicates the dissociation of chemisorbed water is the primary route for OH&#8727; adsorption at low pH condition. Furthermore, it is also found that the variation in dehydrogenation energy across different pH is primarily due to the local hydrogen bonding network surrounding the chemisorbed water. In addition, it is proposed that at high pH conditions OH&#8722; oxidation emerges as the primary route for OH&#8727; adsorption on Pt(111) constrained by the water chemisorption process. This work provides crucial insights into the pH-dependent adsorption behavior of OH&#8727; on the Pt(111) surface and aims to guide the optimization of electrolytes to boost the efficiency of related reactions.</description>

                We propose a novel two-dimensional carbon-based structure with tetra-, hexa-, and dodeca-membered rings, which we refer to by the abbreviated name, THD-C. The structure presents a mixture of sp&#8211;sp2 hybridization and can potentially be synthesized by the topological assembly of 4-ethynyldiphenylacetylene molecules. By employing first-principles calculations, the stability and ease of synthesis of the sheet are investigated and compared with various C-allotropes. We predict its metallic behavior and excellent kinetic and dynamic stability. Due to the crystal structure of the sheet, a strong mechanical anisotropy is observed. The effects of functionalization on the electronic properties of the material are also studied, and different semiconducting systems are obtained. The potential of THD-C for energy storage in metal-based batteries, hydrogen storage, and catalysis is also investigated, and we find a superior performance in comparison to graphite and other allotropes. The quantum confinement effect is investigated by constructing nanoribbons and nanotubes of various sizes. For ribbons, we find that tailor-made electronic and magnetic properties can be obtained and explored in potential spintronic devices. Additionally, we observe that nanotubes are conducting irrespective of their chirality and can potentially be used for capture, storage, and separation of industrially relevant small gas molecules.</description>

      <title>Iron&#8211;Cobalt Phosphide Encapsulated in a N-Doped Carbon Framework as a Promising Low-Cost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalyst for Zinc-Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c02077</link>

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a vital role in many next-generation electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, motivating the search for low-cost ORR electrocatalysts possessing high activity and excellent durability. In this work, we demonstrate that iron&#8211;cobalt phosphide (FeCoP) nanoparticles encapsulated in a N-doped carbon framework (FeCoP@NC) represent a very promising catalyst for the ORR in alkaline media. The core&#8211;shell structured FeCoP@NC catalyst offered outstanding ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.86 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and excellent stability in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming commercial Pt/C and many recently reported noble-metal-free ORR electrocatalysts. The superiority of FeCoP@NC as an ORR electrocatalyst relative to Pt/C was further verified in prototype zinc-air batteries (ZABs), with the aqueous and flexible ZABs prepared using FeCoP@NC offering excellent stability, impressive open circuit voltages (1.56 and 1.44 V, respectively), and high maximum power densities (183.5 and 69.7 mW cm&#8211;2, respectively). Density functional theory calculations revealed that encapsulating FeCoP nanoparticles in N-doped carbon shells resulted in favorable electron penetration effects, which synergistically regulated the adsorption/desorption of ORR intermediates for optimal ORR performance while also boosting the electronic conductivity. Our findings offer valuable new insights for rational design of transition metal phosphide-based catalysts for the ORR and other electrochemical applications.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202403845</link>
      <description>L.-Y. Chen, Wei Zhao, Juntao Zhang, Min Liu, Jun Yin, Ru-Zhi Wang, Maorong Chai, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400122094

                As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.</description>

                The bulk properties and surface chemical reactivity of compositionally disordered Pt&#8211;Fe and Pt&#8211;Co alloys in the fcc A1 phase have been investigated theoretically in comparison to the ordered alloys of the same compositions. The results are analyzed together with our previously reported findings for Pt&#8211;Ni. Nonlinear variation is observed in lattice constant, d band center, magnetic moment, and hydrogen adsorption energy across the composition range (0&#8211;100 atomic % of Pt, xPt). The Pt 5d states are strongly perturbed by the 3d states of the base metals, leading to notable density of states above the Fermi level and residual magnetic moments at high xPt. Surface reactivity in terms of average H adsorption energy varies continuously with composition between the monometallic Fe&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Pt limits, going through a maximum around xPt = 0.5&#8211;0.75. Close inspection reveals a significant variation in site reactivity at xPt &lt; 0.75, particularly with disordered Pt&#8211;Fe alloys due in part to the inherent disparity in chemical reactivity between Fe and Pt. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Fe and Pt causes Pt-rich sites to be less reactive toward H than Pt-rich sites on disordered Pt&#8211;Ni alloy surfaces, despite less compressive strain caused. These results provide theoretical underpinnings for conceptualizing and understanding the performance of these Pt-base metal alloys in key catalytic applications and for efforts to tailor Pt-alloys as catalysts.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Reactivity Origin of Oxygen Reduction at High-Entropy Alloy Electrocatalysts with a Computational and Data-Driven Approach</title>

      <description>Yang Huang, Shih&#8208;Han Wang, Xiangrui Wang, Noushin Omidvar, Luke E.K. Achenie, Sara E. Skrabalak, Hongliang Xin, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400147811

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs), characterized as compositionally complex solid solutions with five or more metal elements, have emerged as a novel class of catalytic materials with unique attributes. Because of the remarkable diversity of multielement sites or site ensembles stabilized by configurational entropy, human exploration of the multidimensional design space of HEAs presents a formidable challenge, necessitating an efficient, computational and data-driven strategy over traditional trial-and-error experimentation or physics-based modeling. Leveraging deep learning interatomic potentials for large-scale molecular simulations and pretrained machine learning models of surface reactivity, our approach effectively rationalizes the enhanced activity of a previously synthesized PdCuPtNiCo HEA nanoparticle system for electrochemical oxygen reduction, as corroborated by experimental observations. We contend that this framework deepens our fundamental understanding of the surface reactivity of high-entropy materials and fosters the accelerated development and synthesis of monodisperse HEA nanoparticles as a versatile material platform for catalyzing sustainable chemical and energy transformations.</description>

                Abstract Fe 3 O 4 is barely taken into account as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), an important reaction for metal&#8212;air batteries and fuel cells, due to its sluggish catalytic kinetics and poor electron conductivity. Herein, how strain engineering can be employed to regulate the local electronic structure of Fe 3 O 4 for high ORR activity is reported. Compressively strained Fe 3 O 4 shells with 2.0% shortened Fe&#9472;O bond are gained on the Fe/Fe 4 N cores as a result of lattice mismatch at the interface. A downshift of the d&#8208;band center occurs for compressed Fe 3 O 4 , leading to weakened chemisorption energy of oxygenated intermediates, and lower reaction overpotential. The compressed Fe 3 O 4 exhibits greatly enhanced electrocatalytic ORR activity with a kinetic current density of 27 times higher than that of pristine one at 0.80 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), as well as potential application in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The findings provide a new strategy for tuning electronic structures and improving the catalytic activity of other metal catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Atomic Ag cluster bonding is employed to reinforce the interface between PF3T nano&#8208;cluster and TiO 2 nanoparticle. With an optimized Ag loading (Ag/TiO 2 = 0.5 wt%), the Ag atoms will uniformly disperse on TiO 2 thus generating a high density of intermediate states in the band gap to form the electron channel between the terthiophene group of PF3T and the TiO 2 in the hybrid composite (denoted as T@Ag05&#8208;P). The former expands the photon absorption band width and the latter facilitates the core&#8208;hole splitting by injecting the photon excited electron (from the excitons in PF3T) into the conduction band (CB) of TiO 2 . These characteristics enable the high efficiency of H 2 production to 16 580 &#181;mol h &#8722;1 g &#8722;1 and photocatalysis stability without degradation under visible light exposure for 96 h. Compared to that of hybrid material without Ag bonding (TiO 2 @PF3T), the H 2 production yield and stability are improved by 4.1 and 18.2&#8208;fold which shows the best performance among existing materials in similar component combination and interfacial reinforcement. The unique bonding method offers a new prospect to accelerate the development of photocatalytic hydrogen production technologies.</description>

                Abstract The development of deposition processes for metal carbide thin films is rapidly advancing, driven by their potential for applications including catalysis, batteries, and semiconductor devices. Within this landscape, atomic layer deposition (ALD) offers exceptional conformality, uniformity, and thickness control on spatially complex structures. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the thermal ALD of MoC x with MoCl 5 and 1,4&#8208;bis(trimethylgermyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyrazine [(Me 3 Ge) 2 DHP] as precursors, focusing on the functional properties and characterization of the films. The depositions are conducted at 200&#8211;300 &#176;C and very smooth films with RMS Rq &#8776;0.3&#8211;0.6 nm on Si, TiN, and HfO 2 substrates are obtained. The process has a high growth rate of 1.5 &#197; cycle &#8722;1 and the films appear to be continuous already after 5 cycles. The films are conductive even at thicknesses below 5 nm, and films above 18 nm exhibit superconductivity up to 4.4 K. In lieu of suitable references, Raman modes for molybdenum carbides and nitrides are calculated and X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used for phase analysis.</description>

                Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a key process for the energy transition. Transition metal atoms atomically dispersed on a solid support represent a promising approach to the design of new catalytic materials. The interest for single&#8208; (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) is steadily growing. In general, DACs are considered more active than SACs for NRR. In this work, the complex chemistry behind NRR is investigated on a set of SACs and DACs by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that self&#8208;interaction corrected exchange&#8208;correlation functionals must be adopted, at variance with several studies in the literature. Furthermore, it is not possible to extrapolate results obtained on conventional extended catalytic surfaces to SACs and DACs, due to a richer scenario of possible reaction paths. In general, the results show a positive effect on the catalytic activity moving from 3d to 5d metals, and from SACs and DACs. However, if the two effects work together, that is, 5d metals in DACs, the reaction intermediates may be too strongly bound, thus resulting in reduced catalytic activity. In this respect, the fact that DACs are expected to be superior to SACs in NRR is not always verified.</description>

                Abstract Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to their 100% atomic utilization efficiency. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO using SAC offers a promising approach for CO2 utilization, but achieving facile CO2 adsorption and CO desorption remains challenging for traditional SACs. Instead of singling out specific atoms, we propose a novel strategy utilizing atoms from the entire lanthanide (Ln) group to facilitate the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations, operando spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy elucidate the bridging adsorption mechanism for a representative erbium (Er) single-atom catalyst. Remarkably, we realize a series of Ln SACs spanning 14 elements that exhibit CO Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. The Er catalyst achieves an ultrahigh turnover frequency of ~ 130,000 h&#8210;1, accompanying with a remarkable 42.6% full-cell energy efficiency and record-high 94% single-pass CO2 conversion efficiency. This unparalleled catalytic platform leverages the collective potential of the lanthanide group, introducing new possibilities for efficient CO2-to-CO conversion and beyond through the exploration of unique bonding motifs in single-atom catalysts.</description>

                Green and highly selective synthesis of ammonia (NH 3 ) via electrochemical reduction reaction of toxic nitrite (NO 2 &#8722; RR) in a neutral electrolyte is a feasible solution for energy and environmental issues. Dual&#8208;nature electrocatalysts combining metal and metal&#8208;derived materials are crucial for enhancing the selectivity parameter and efficacy of this reaction. Here, Pd&#8208;, Pt&#8208;, Ru&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;decorated Co 3 (PO 4 ) 2 (CoPi) composites with a robust metal&#8211;support interaction are obtained via the one&#8208;pot pulsed laser ablation in liquid method. Among the designed composites, Ir&#8211;CoPi affords &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency, mass balance, and selectivity toward NH 3 product at sufficiently low potentials. Further, it affords the highest NH 3 yield rate of 19.13 mg h &#8722;1 cm &#8722;2 with 78.1% removal of toxic NO 2 &#8722; with a rate constant k app = 0.31 m m min &#8722;1 under &#8722;1.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. In situ experiments and theoretical investigations reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for this outstanding performance of Ir&#8211;CoPi, which can be accredited to the generation of specific active sites on the Ir component. Insights derived from the evolving intermediate reactive species provide new opportunities for large&#8208;scale NH 3 production through electrochemical techniques, density functional theory calculations, and the improvement of the corresponding industrial processes.</description>

                Presently, there is a significant focus on the investigation and advancement of polymer-modified asphalt that is both high-performing and environmentally sustainable. This study thoroughly examined the performance and modification mechanism of gutta-percha (GP) as a novel asphalt modifier. The investigation was conducted using a combination of macro- and microscopic testing, as well as molecular dynamics simulations. This work primarily examined the compatibility of GP with asphalt molecular modeling. This paper used molecular dynamics to identify the most suitable mixing temperature. Next, the gray correlation theory was used to discuss the most effective method for preparing gutta-percha-modified asphalt (GPMA). The macro-rheological tests and microscopic performance analysis provided a full understanding of the impact of GP on asphalt properties and the process of alteration. The findings indicate that eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) exhibits good compatibility with asphalt, while sulfur-vulcanized eucommia ulmoides gum (SEUG) does not demonstrate compatibility with asphalt. Both EUG and SEUG enhance the thermal stability and resistance to deformation of asphalt at high temperatures, with SEUG having a particularly notable effect. However, both additives do not improve the resistance of asphalt to cracking at low temperatures. The manufacturing method for EUG-modified asphalt (EUGMA) involves physical mixing, whereas sulfur-vulcanized eucommia ulmoides gum-modified asphalt (SEUGMA) involves physical mixing together with certain chemical processes. This research establishes a theoretical foundation for the advancement of GP as a novel environmentally friendly and highly effective asphalt modification.</description>
