      <title>Instant prediction of scientific paper cited potential based on semantic and metadata features: Taking artificial intelligence field as an example</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312945</link>
      <description>Hou Zhu, Li Shuhuai, PLoS ONE. 19(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404914188

                With the continuous increase in the number of academic researchers, the volume of scientific papers is also increasing rapidly. The challenge of identifying papers with greater potential academic impact from this large pool has received increasing attention. The citation frequency of a paper is often used as an objective indicator to gauge the academic influence of the paper. The task of citation frequency prediction based on historical citation data in previous studies can achieve high accuracy. However, it can only be executed after the paper has been published for a period. The delay is not conducive to timely discovery of papers with high citation frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting cited potential of a paper based on the metadata and semantic information, which can predict the cited potential of academic paper instantly once it has been published. Specifically, the semantic information, such as abstract, semantic span and semantic inflection, is extracted to enhance the ability of the prediction model based on machine learning. To prove the effectiveness and rationality of cited potential prediction model, we conduct two experiments to validate the model and find the most effective combination of input information. The empirical experiments show that the prediction accuracy of our proposed model can reach 88% for the instant prediction of citation.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Adsorption at the Electrochemical Metal/Water Interface: Au(111) vs Pt(111)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c06384</link>

                Reaction mechanisms in heterogeneous electrocatalysis have been known to change through the local field that arises at the electrified metal/liquid interface. First-principles simulations specifically predict that such a field can significantly modify the surface binding of dipolar or polarizable intermediates along a catalytic reaction path. This dependence can then lead to a corresponding dependence upon applied potential even for so-called "chemical" reaction steps that do not involve an explicit proton-coupled electron transfer such as, e.g., O2 adsorption during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). And yet, such effects are only now starting to be systematically explored at the atomic level. In this study, we directly compare the potential dependence of O2 adsorption as the first ORR step on Au(111) vs Pt(111). Using ab initio molecular dynamics and free energy sampling, we find that the strong dependence previously predicted at Au(111) is specifically lost at Pt(111). By decoupling the O2 potential response into contributions of different physical origin, we explain this contrast through the inherently different reactivity of the two metals. We finally discuss an indirect effect of potential through the surface coverage that can promote a dissociative-type mechanism at Pt(111) by breaking the O&#8211;O bond already during the first step of the ORR mechanism. Our results thus overall suggest a more complex mechanistic picture than hitherto anticipated; one where the local field may manifest in different, yet potentially equally important, ways over different systems.</description>

                One grand challenge for deploying porous carbons with embedded metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) moieties as platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is their fast degradation and inferior activity. Here, we report the modulation of the local environment at Fe&#8211;N4 sites via the application of atomic Sn&#8211;Nx sites for simultaneously improved durability and activity. We discovered that Sn&#8211;Nx sites not only promote the formation of the more stable D2 FeN4C10 sites but also invoke a unique D3 SnNx&#8211;FeIIN4 site that is characterized by having atomically dispersed bridged Sn&#8211;Nx and Fe&#8211;N4. This new D3 site exhibits significantly improved stability against demetalation and several times higher turnover frequency for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the shift of the reaction pathway from a single-site associative mechanism to a dual-site dissociative mechanism with the adjacent Sn site facilitating a lower overpotential cleavage of the O&#8211;O bond. This mechanism bypasses the formation of the otherwise inevitable intermediate that is responsible for demetalation, where two hydroxyl intermediates bind to one Fe site. As a result, a mesoporous Fe/Sn-PNC catalyst exhibits a positively shifted ORR half-wave potential and more than 50% lower peroxide formation. This, in combination with the stable D3 site and enriched D2 Fe sites, significantly enhanced the catalyst's durability as demonstrated in membrane electrode assemblies using complementary accelerated durability testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Disrupted Spin Degeneracy Promoted C&#8801;C Triple Bond Activation for Efficient Electrochemical Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06191</link>
      <description>Menglei Yuan, Hongyu Jiang, Ruyi Jiang, Zhao Wang, Zhihao Zhao, Bao&#8208;Lian Su, Jian Zhang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404924221

                Disrupting the spin degeneracy of the electrocatalyst and further manipulating the related orbital electron arrangement are highly desirable for activating acetylene molecules. Herein, a squarate cobalt-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Co-MOF) ([Co3(C4O4)2(OH)2]&#183;3H2O) is post-treated to accelerate the evolution from CoO6 octahedron to CoO5 pentahedron and further utilized for the electrochemical acetylene semihydrogenation reaction. Comprehensive analyses corroborate that the disrupted spin degeneracy of active sites originated from the breakage of the Co&#8211;O bond, which promotes the cleavage of the orbital energy level and the rearrangement of the d-orbital electron. The newly emerged half-occupied dx2&#8211;y2 orbitals and empty dz2 orbitals in CoO5 pentahedron concerted interplay with the bonding and antibonding orbitals of acetylene, which reduces the adsorption energy of acetylene and facilitates the activation of the inert C&#8801;C triple bond. Thus, the defective Co-MOF exhibits the superior ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 96% and partial current density of 128 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE compared to that of pristine Co-MOF (FEC2H4: 60%; JC2H4: 66 mA cm&#8211;2). This work delivers inspiration for spin-state regulation of active sites and sparks renewed interest in designing highly efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                This paper thoroughly examines the latest developments and diverse applications of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in civil engineering. It provides a critical analysis of the technology&#8217;s potential to mitigate the effects of climate change. Initially, a comprehensive outline of CCUS technologies is presented, emphasising their vital function in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission capture, conversion, and sequestration. Subsequent sections provide an in-depth analysis of carbon capture technologies, utilisation processes, and storage solutions. These serve as the foundation for an architectural framework that facilitates the design and integration of efficient systems. Significant attention is given to the inventive application of CCUS in the building and construction industry. Notable examples of such applications include using carbon (C) in cement and promoting sustainable cement production. Economic analyses and financing mechanisms are reviewed to assess the commercial feasibility and scalability of CCUS projects. In addition, this review examines the technological advances and innovations that have occurred, providing insight into the potential future course of CCUS progress. A comprehensive analysis of the environmental and regulatory environments is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and compliance with the policies of CCUS technology deployment. Case studies from the real world are provided to illustrate effectiveness and practical applications. It concludes by emphasising the importance of continued research, policy support, and innovation in developing CCUS technologies as a fundamental component of sustainable civil engineering practices. A tenacious stride toward carbon neutrality is underscored.</description>

                Abstract Ligand protected gold nanoclusters have been proposed for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) as an alternative to polycrystalline catalysts, showing higher selectivity control due to the tailored composition and precise microenvironment. Here, two gold cluster families are studied with different staple motifs (Au 25 (SR) 18 and Au 144 (SR) 60 , where SR = thiolate) doped with Ag or Cu to understand the interplay between the composition and the performance of these catalysts. Detailed cluster characterization and Density Functional Theory simulations demonstrate that the dynamic aspects involving ligand removal are crucial to unraveling the role of the dopant, the cluster curvature, and the staple structure. The best activity performance toward CO is obtained for Cu&#8208;doped Au 144 (SR) 60 at U = &#8211;0.8 V RHE as ligands are only partially depleted and the staple can bend to stabilize *CO intermediate, while Cu&#8208;containing Au 25 (SR) 18 can produce formate but shows worse CO selectivity. This study points toward the importance of ligand stability during eCO 2 R on bimetallic gold nanoclusters, paving the way for improving the design and operation of this family of catalysts.</description>

                Strain engineering has the potential to modify the adsorption process and enhance the electrocatalytic activity, especially in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the introduction of lattice strain in electrocatalysts is often accompanied by a change in chemical composition, surface morphology, or phase structure to a certain extent, impeding the investigation of the intrinsic strain effect on HER.

      <title>Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction Driven by Mo-Based Double-Atom Catalysts Anchored on Graphdiyne</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14120879</link>
      <description>Xiaoyu Chi, Yaqi Cang, Jianhua Wang, Qing Li, Xing Fan, Haiping Lin, Catalysts. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404993416

                An electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) presents an appealing strategy for ammonia (NH3) production at ambient conditions. Through systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the eNRR performance of 23 double-atom catalysts has been investigated. These catalysts are composed of a Mo atom and a transition metal atom anchored on the graphdiyne (GDY), and they are named MoM-GDYs. Among the 23 MoM-GDYs studied, 14 MoM-GDYs highlighted catalytic selectivity by inhibiting a competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and demonstrated commendable eNRR catalytic performance. MoRu-GDY, MoMo-GDY, MoFe-GDY and MoY-GDY exhibited excellent eNRR catalytic activity with limiting potentials of &#8722;0.05 V, &#8722;0.13 V, &#8722;0.21 V and &#8722;0.24 V, respectively. These 14 catalysts favor N2 adsorption compared to H and exhibit less negative UL than the &#8722;0.98 V benchmark of the stepped Ru(0001) surface. Among them, MoRu-GDY has the best catalytic activity with an UL of &#8722;0.05 V. The excellent catalytic performance originates from the synergistic effect of the dual catalytic sites, where the alternation of the consecutive and enzymatic paths effectively reduces the limiting potentials. In addition, the catalytic activity can be evaluated using &#916;G*NH3 &#8722; &#916;G*NH2 as a theoretical descriptor, while UL and the &#916;G*NH3 &#8722; &#916;G*NH2 fit coefficient R2 reached 0.99. These findings not only contribute to the development of dual-atom electrocatalysts for eNRR but also offer a valuable pathway for identifying new eNRR catalysts with high activity and selectivity.</description>

                The use of a single-atom FeN4 catalyst on defective graphene (Fe-NC) has recently emerged as an effective method for the synthesis of amino acids. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of alanine formation on FeN4-doped graphene using comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. The alanine formation reaction begins with the activation of NO molecules on the surface, followed by their reaction with hydrogen atoms provided in the system. The computational results show that NO molecules can be effectively activated on Fe-NC, facilitating the subsequent alanine formation at a relatively lower potential. The potential-limiting step in alanine production involves either the formation of HNO* or HNOH* intermediates on Fe-NG, as the free energy changes (&#916;G) in these two elementary steps are nearly equivalent. Notably, the formation of HNO* exhibits a higher activation energy (Ea) compared to HNOH* formation. This study provides valuable insights into the C&#8211;N coupling reaction and the mechanism of amino acid synthesis on single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of atomic structures with prior probabilities from universal interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevmaterials.8.123802</link>

                The optimization of atomic structures plays a pivotal role in understanding and designing materials with desired properties. However, conventional computational methods often struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy surface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima. Recent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a promising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we propose anapproach that combines the strengths of universal machine learning potentials with a Bayesian approach using Gaussian processes. By using the machine learning potentials as priors for the Gaussian process, the Gaussian process has to learn only the difference between the machine learning potential and the target energy surface calculated for example by density functional theory. This turns out to improve the speed by which the global optimal structure is identified across diverse systems for a well-behaved machine learning potential. The approach is tested on periodic bulk materials, surface structures, and a cluster.</description>

      <title>Black-box optimization technique for investigation of surface phase diagram</title>

      <description>Makoto Urushihara, Kenji Yamaguchi, Ryo Tamura, AIP Advances. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405016963

                Surface phase diagrams are useful in material design for understanding catalytic reactions and deposition processes and are usually obtained by numerical calculations. However, a large number of calculations are required, and a strategy to reduce the computation time is necessary. In this study, we proposed a black-box optimization strategy to investigate the surface phase diagram with the smallest possible number of calculations. Our method was tested to examine the phase diagram in which two types of adsorbates, i.e., oxygen and carbon monoxide, were adsorbed onto a palladium surface. In comparison with a random calculation without using machine learning, we confirmed that the proposed method obtained a surface phase diagram with a small number of calculations. In conclusion, our strategy is a general-purpose method that can contribute to the rapid study of various types of surface phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Tackling activity-stability paradox of reconstructed NiIrOx electrocatalysts by bridged W-O moiety</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54987-4</link>
      <description>Muhammad Imran Abdullah, Fang Yu-sheng, Xiaobing Wu, Meiqi Hu, Jing Shao, Youkun Tao, Haijiang Wang, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405022664

                One challenge remaining in the development of Ir-based electrocatalyst is the activity-stability paradox during acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially for the surface reconstructed IrOx catalyst with high efficiency. To address this, a phase selective Ir-based electrocatalyst is constructed by forming bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst. Through an electrochemical dealloying process, an nano-porous structure with surface-hydroxylated rutile NiWIrOx electrocatalyst is engineered via Ni as a sacrificial element. Despite low Ir content, NiWIrOx demonstrates a minimal overpotential of 180 mV for the OER at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. It maintains a stable 300 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 current density during an approximately 300 h OER at 1.8 VRHE and shows a stability number of 3.9 &#215; 105 noxygen &#183; nIr&#8722;1. The resulting W &#8211; O&#8211;Ir bridging motif proves pivotal for enhancing the efficacy of OER catalysis by facilitating deprotonation of OER intermediates and promoting a thermodynamically favorable dual-site adsorbent evolution mechanism. Besides, the phase selective insertion of W-O in NiIrOx enabling charge balance through the W-O-Ir bridging motif, effectively counteracting lattice oxygen loss by regulating Ir-O co-valency. One challenge remaining in the electrocatalysts for acidic water electrolysis is the activity-stability paradox. Here, the authors report a facile approach to tackle the challenge by introducing a bridged W-O moiety in NiIrOx electrocatalyst, enhancing the efficacy and stability simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Species mass transfer governs the selectivity of gas diffusion electrodes toward H2O2 electrosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55091-3</link>

                The meticulous design of advanced electrocatalysts and their integration into gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architectures is emerging as a prominent research paradigm in the H2O2 electrosynthesis community. However, it remains perplexing that electrocatalysts and assembled GDE frequently exhibit substantial discrepancies in H2O2 selectivity during bulk electrolysis. Here, we elucidate the pivotal role of mass transfer behavior of key species (including reactants and products) beyond the intrinsic properties of the electrocatalyst in dictating electrode-scale H2O2 selectivity. This tendency becomes more pronounced in high reaction rate (current density) regimes where transport limitations are intensified. By utilizing diffusion-related parameters (DRP) of GDEs (i.e., wettability and catalyst layer thickness) as probe factors, we employ both short- and long-term electrolysis in conjunction with in-situ electrochemical reflection-absorption imaging and theoretical calculations to thoroughly investigate the impact of DRP and DRP-controlled local microenvironments on O2 and H2O2 mass transfer. The mechanistic origins of diffusion-dependent conversion selectivity at the electrode scale are unveiled accordingly. The fundamental insights gained from this study underscore the necessity of architectural innovations for mainstream hydrophobic GDEs that can synchronously optimize mass transfer of reactants and products, paving the way for next-generation GDEs in gas-consuming electroreduction scenarios. Electrocatalysts and assembled gas diffusion electrodes frequently exhibit discrepancies in selectivity during H2O2 electrosynthesis. Here, the authors report the pivotal role of key species transport beyond the intrinsic properties of electrocatalysts in dictating electrode-scale H2O2 selectivity.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Electric&#8211;Hydrogen Coupled Integrated Energy System Considering the Integration of Wind&#8211;PV&#8211;Diesel&#8211;Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/modelling5040101</link>
      <description>Shuguang Zhao, Yuqiang Han, Qicheng Xu, Ziping Wang, Yinghao Shan, Modelling&#8212;International Open Access Journal of Modelling in Engineering Science. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405071782

                Hydrogen energy plays an increasingly vital role in global energy transformation. However, existing electric&#8211;hydrogen coupled integrated energy systems (IESs) face two main challenges: achieving stable operation when integrated with large-scale networks and integrating optimal dispatching code with physical systems. This paper conducted comprehensive modeling, optimization and joint simulation verification of the above IES. Firstly, a low-carbon economic dispatching model of an electric&#8211;hydrogen coupled IES considering carbon capture power plants is established at the optimization layer. Secondly, by organizing and selecting representative data in the optimal dispatch model, an electric&#8211;hydrogen coupled IES planning model considering the integration of wind, photovoltaic (PV), diesel and storage is constructed at the physical layer. The proposed electric&#8211;hydrogen coupling model mainly consists of the following components: an alkaline electrolyzer, a high-pressure hydrogen storage tank with a compressor and a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The IES model proposed in this paper achieved the integration of optimal dispatching mode with physical systems. The system can maintain stable control and operation despite unpredictable changes in renewable energy sources, showing strong resilience and reliability. This electric&#8211;hydrogen coupling model also can integrate with large-scale IES for stable joint operation, enhancing renewable energy utilization and absorption of PV and wind power. Co-simulation verification showed that the optimized model has achieved a 29.42% reduction in total system cost and an 83.66% decrease in carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the simulation model proved that the system&#8217;s total harmonic distortion rate is controlled below 3% in both grid-connected and islanded modes, indicating good power quality.</description>

      <title>Metal-Independent Correlations for Site-Specific Binding Energies of Relevant Catalytic Intermediates</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.4c00759</link>

                Establishing energy correlations among different metals can accelerate the discovery of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for complex reactions. Using a recently introduced coordination-based model, we can predict site-specific metal binding energies (&#916;EM) that can be used as a descriptor for chemical reactions. In this study, we have examined a range of metals including Ag, Au, Co, Cu, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru and found linear correlations between predicted &#916;EM and adsorption energies of CH and O (&#916;ECH and &#916;EO) at various coordination environments for all the considered metals. Interestingly, all the metals correlate with one another under specific surface site coordination, indicating that different metals are interrelated in a particular coordination environment. Furthermore, we have tested and verified for PtPd- and PtIr-based alloys that they follow a similar behavior. Moreover, we have expanded the metal space by taking some early transition metals along with a few s-block metals and shown a cyclic behavior of the adsorbate binding energy (&#916;EA) versus &#916;EM. Therefore, &#916;ECH and &#916;EO can be efficiently interpolated between metals, alloys, and intermetallics based on information related to one metal only. This simplifies the process of screening new metal catalyst formulations and their reaction energies.</description>

The limitations associated with lithium&#8217;s supply chain, cost, and safety concerns have prompted the exploration of alternative battery chemistries. For this reason, research to replace widespread lithium batteries with sodium-ion batteries has received more and more attention. In the present work, we report cutting-edge research, where we explored a wide range of compositions of cathode materials for Na-ion batteries by first-principles calculations using workflow chains developed within the AiiDA framework. We trained crystal graph convolutional neural networks and geometric crystal graph neural networks, and we demonstrate the ability of the machine learning algorithms to predict the formation energy of the candidate materials as calculated by the density functional theory. This materials discovery approach is disruptive and significantly faster than traditional physics-based computational methods.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent guest-memory switching of the flexible and robust adsorption characteristics of layered metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr1387</link>
      <description>Satoshi Watanabe, Shotaro Hiraide, Homare Arima, Akiko Fukuta, Miyuki Mori, Hideki Tanaka, Minoru T. Miyahara, Science Advances. 10(49)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405103471

                Flexible-robust metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique hybrid nature comprising both flexible and rigid framework characteristics, exhibit high potential for hydrocarbon separations. However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is crucial for sustainable energy solutions, focusing on energy harvesting, storage, and pollution control. Despite the development of various electrocatalysts, understanding the dynamic processes in electrochemical reactions is still limited, hindering effective catalyst design. In situ Raman spectra have emerged as a critical tool, providing molecular-level insights into surface processes under operational conditions and discussing their development, advantages, and configurations. This review emphasizes new findings at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, especially interface water molecule state, during the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in recent years. Finally, the challenges and future directions for in situ Raman techniques in electrocatalysis are discussed, emphasizing their importance in advancing understanding and guiding novel catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Cycling Zinc Sites Promote Ruthenium Oxide for Sub-Ampere Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

                Although iridium-based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, their exorbitant cost and scarcity severely restrict their widespread application. Herein, we introduce a promising alternative to iridium: zinc-doped ruthenium dioxide (TE-Zn/RuO2), which exhibits remarkable and enduring activity for acidic OER. In situ characterizations elucidate that the dynamic cycling of zinc dopants serves as both electron acceptors and donors, facilitating the activation of Ru sites at low overpotentials while thwarting peroxidation at high overpotentials, thus concurrently achieving heightened activity and robust stability. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc induces weakened Ru&#8211;O covalency, thereby stabling *OOH intermediates and instigating a sustained adsorbate evolution mechanism, dramatically stabilizing the RuO2 lattice. Importantly, the TE-Zn/RuO2 catalyst as an anode exhibits good stability over 300 h at a water-splitting current of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 in the PEMWE device, underscoring its considerable promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Novel Single-Atom Catalysts of Transition-Metal-Doped 2D AlN Monolayer as Highly Effective Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29235768</link>
      <description>Xiaopeng Shen, Qinfang Zhang, Molecules. 29(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405122489

                The single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) have garnered significant attention in recent years. The NRR is regarded as a milder and greener approach to ammonia synthesis. The pursuit of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the NRR continues to garner substantial interest, yet it poses a significant challenge. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the stability and catalytic activity of 29 transition metal atoms loaded on the two-dimensional (2D) AlN monolayer with Al monovacancy (TM@AlN) for the conversion of N2 to NH3. After screening the activity and selectivity of NRR, it was found that Os@AlN exhibited the highest activity for NRR with a very low limiting potential of &#8722;0.46 V along the distal pathway. The analysis of the related electronic structure, Bader charge, electron localization function, and PDOS revealed the origin of NRR activity from the perspective of energy and electronic properties. The high activity and selectivity towards the NRR of SACs are closely associated with the Os-3N coordination. Our findings have expanded the scope of designing innovative high-efficiency SACs for NRR.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Screening Approach for Catalytic Applications through Regulation of Adsorption Energies via Work Function</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c03385</link>
      <description>Xuhong Zhao, Jianwei Wang, Xiaobin Niu, Langmuir. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404913328

                Adsorption energy is critical in catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Optimal adsorption energy on a catalytic substrate is essential as extreme adsorption energy can reduce the reaction efficiency. Building on our previous research on the influence of work function on adsorption energy (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2024, 26, 3525&#8211;3530), we examined a range of two-dimensional semiconductor materials, including black phosphorene, boron nitride, and MoS2, as supporting substrates for the construction of silicene&#8211;semiconductor heterojunctions. Furthermore, we analyzed how work function changes impact adsorption energy during O2 adsorption and developed a theoretical model to explain this relationship. The model was validated by demonstrating the regulation of the catalytic reaction barrier in the oxygen reduction reaction and was applied to N2 adsorption via high-throughput screening. Our findings demonstrate that the work function modulates the adsorption energy in van der Waals heterojunctions, enhancing catalytic efficiency. This approach aligns with the Sabatier principle and offers a pathway for optimizing catalysts.</description>
