                NiFe-based nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising catalysts to replace platinum, ruthenium and iridium for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; production process through water splitting. Using iron (2+) sulfate and nickel acetate as the raw materials, with the molar ratio of Ni acetate to iron (2+) sulfate controlled at 8:5, the concentration of metal-ion was 0.6 mol/L, and precursor fibers rich in Ni2+, Fe2+, and SO4 2&#8722; were prepared using electrospinning technology, with polyvinyl alcohol acting as the colloid. Subsequently, composite nanorods rich in the elements of Ni, Fe, S, and C were successfully obtained at a heat treatment temperature of 1000&#176;C in an Ar gas atmosphere. The results demonstrate that the nanorod samples possessed a surface diameter of ~200 nm, and the main phases of the nanorods after heat treatment at 1000&#176;C included FeNi3 alloy, (Fe,Ni)9S8, Ni4S3, and amorphous C. Electrochemical performance tests conducted in a 1.0 mol/L KOH solution exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction properties of the catalysts prepared using FeNi3/(Fe,Ni)9S8/Ni4S3/C nanorods as the materials. The overpotential was about 258.6 mV of the catalyst material at 10 mA&#61589;cm&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Highly stable and active catalyst in fuel cells through surface atomic ordering</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado4935</link>
      <description>Ma Yanling, Jiaheng Peng, Jiakang Tian, Wenpei Gao, Jialiang Xu, Fan Li, Peter Tieu, Hao Hu, Yi Wu, Yuanlong Zhao, Lei Pan, Wen Shang, Peng Tao, Chengyi Song, Hong Zhu, Xiaoqing Pan, Tao Deng, Jianbo Wu, Science Advances. 10(42)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403533158

                Shape-controlled alloy nanoparticle catalysts have been shown to exhibit improved performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in liquid half-cells. However, translating the success to catalyst layers in fuel cells faces challenges due to the more demanding operation conditions in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Balancing durability and activity is crucial. Here, we developed a strategy that limits the atomic diffusion within surface layers, fostering the phase transition and shape retention during thermal treatment. This enables selective transformation of platinum-iron nanowire surfaces into intermetallic structures via atomic ordering at a low temperature. The catalysts exhibit enhanced MEA stability with 50% less Fe loss while maintaining high catalytic activity comparable to that in half-cells. Density functional calculations suggest that the ordered intermetallic surface stabilizes morphology against rapid corrosion and improves the ORR activity. The surface engineering through atomic ordering presents potential for practical application in fuel cells with shape-controlled Pt-based alloy catalysts.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals semiconductor InSe plastifies by martensitic transformation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado9593</link>
      <description>Yandong Sun, Yupeng Ma, Jinyu Zhang, Tian&#8208;Ran Wei, Xun Shi, David Rodney, Ben Xu, Science Advances. 10(42)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403533295

                Inorganic semiconductor materials are crucial for modern technologies, but their brittleness and limited processability hinder the development of flexible, wearable, and miniaturized electronics. The recent discovery of room-temperature plasticity in some inorganic semiconductors offers a promising solution, but the deformation mechanisms remain controversial. Here, we investigate the deformation of indium selenide, a two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductor with substantial plasticity. By developing a machine-learned deep potential, we perform atomistic simulations that capture the deformation features of hexagonal indium selenide upon out-of-plane compression. Unexpectedly, we find that indium selenide plastifies through a martensitic transformation; that is, the layered hexagonal structure is converted to a tetragonal lattice with specific orientation relationship. This observation is corroborated by high-resolution experimental observations and theory. It suggests a change of paradigm, where the design of new plastically deformable inorganic semiconductors can focus on compositions and structures that facilitate phase transformations, going beyond the conventional dislocation slip.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Underpotential Deposition at Specific Sites of N-Doped Graphene for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysis</title>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have the advantages of good active site uniformity, high atom utilization, and high catalytic activity. However, the study of its controllable synthesis still needs to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we deposited Cu SAs on nanoporous N-doped graphene by underpotential deposition and further obtained a Pt SAC by a galvanic process. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses showed that the pyridine-like N defect sites are the specific sites for the underpotential-deposited SAs. The obtained Pt SAC exhibits a good activity in a hydrogen evolution reaction with a turnover frequency of 25.1 s&#8722;1. This work reveals the specific sites of UPD of SAs on N-doped graphene and their potential applications in HERs, which provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of SACs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Bimetallic PtPd/C Cathode Catalysts to Enhance the Performance of PEM Fuel Cells</title>

                Bimetallic platinum-containing catalysts are deemed promising for electrolyzers and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). A significant number of laboratory studies and commercial offers are related to PtNi/C and PtCo/C electrocatalysts. The behavior of PtPd/C catalysts has been studied much less, although palladium itself is the metal closest to platinum in its properties. Using a series of characterization methods, this paper presents a comparative study of structural characteristics of the commercial PtPd/C catalysts containing 38% wt. of precious metals and the well-known HiSpec4000 Pt/C catalyst. The electrochemical behavior of the catalysts was studied both in a three-electrode electrochemical cell and in the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) of hydrogen&#8211;air PEMFCs. Both PtPd/C samples demonstrated higher values of the electrochemically active surface area, as well as greater specific and mass activity in the oxygen reduction reaction in comparison with conventional Pt/C, while not being inferior to the latter in durability. The MEA based on the best of the PtPd/C catalysts also exhibited higher performance in single tests and long-term durability testing. The results of this study conducted indicate the prospects of using bimetallic PtPd/C materials for cathode catalysts in PEMFCs.</description>

                Abstract The development of oxygen&#8208;dependent fuel cells is frequently hindered by the high cost of cathode materials and the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It is thus crucial to explore low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;activity catalysts with accelerated mass transport. Here, a high&#8208;throughput screening method is developed by integrating an explicit solvation model with machine learning potential&#8208;based molecular dynamics simulations, which enables the efficient evaluation of a vast array of diverse diatomic combinations and ultimately identifying Fe&#8211;Co dual&#8208;atomic sites as the optimal ORR electrocatalysts. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the diatomic Fe/Co sites loaded on 3D&#8208;interconnected ordered macroporous carbon (FeCo&#8208;3DMNC) is experimentally verified, achieving high ORR activity with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.806 V in acidic and 0.905 V in alkaline environments. Additionally, innovative hybrid acid/alkali aluminum&#8211;air fuel cells (hA/A&#8208;AAFCs) incorporating FeCo&#8208;3DMNC as the cathode catalyst demonstrate a notably high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.72 V and a record&#8208;breaking power density of 827 mW cm &#8722;2 , significantly outperforming conventional alkaline aluminum&#8211;air fuel cells. This work marks a significant advancement by combining cutting&#8208;edge computational screening with rigorous experimental validation to develop promising electrocatalysts, potentially paving the way for the advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.</description>

                The transformative impact of modern computational paradigms and technologies, such as high-performance computing (HPC), quantum computing, and cloud computing, has opened up profound new opportunities for scientific simulations. Scalable computational chemistry is one beneficiary of this technological progress. The main focus of this paper is on the performance of various quantum chemical formulations, ranging from low-order methods to high-accuracy approaches, implemented in different computational chemistry packages and libraries, such as NWChem, NWChemEx, Scalable Predictive Methods for Excitations and Correlated Phenomena, ExaChem, and Fermi&#8211;L&#246;wdin orbital self-interaction correction on Azure Quantum Elements, Microsoft's cloud services platform for scientific discovery. We pay particular attention to the intricate workflows for performing complex chemistry simulations, associated data curation, and mechanisms for accuracy assessment, which is demonstrated with the Arrows automated workflow for high throughput simulations. Finally, we provide a perspective on the role of cloud computing in supporting the mission of leadership computational facilities.</description>

                Catalysis of multicomponent transformations requires controlled assembly of reactants within the active site. Supramolecular scaffolds possess synthetic microenvironments that enable precise modulation over noncovalent interactions (NCIs) engaged by reactive, encapsulated species. While molecular properties that describe the behavior of single guests in host cavities have been studied extensively, multicomponent transformations remain challenging to design and deploy. Here, simple univariate regression and threshold analyses are employed to model reactivity in a cascade reduction of azaarenes catalyzed by water-soluble metal organic cages. Yield and stereoselectivity models help deduce unknown mechanisms of reactivity by the multicomponent, host&#8211;guest complexes. Furthermore, a comprehensive model is established for NCIs driving stereoselectivity in the reported host&#8211;guest adducts.</description>

                To quickly and efficiently screen catalytic materials with both activity and selectivity for the nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR), we adopted a strategy that considers the activity of the side reaction hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) first. It can be seen that Fe3(THT)2 (THT = triphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexathiol) has extremely excellent HER activity, with a Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G) of 0.007 eV. Based on the relationship between &#916;G and theoretical exchange current density, all TM3(THT)2 can be divided into two regions: one is the absolute values of &#916;G greater than 1 eV, the other is the absolute values of &#916;G greater than 0 eV and less than 1eV. Obviously, the candidates with the absolute values of &#916;G greater than 1 eV have poor HER performance, but this precisely provides the possibility of obtaining NORR catalytic materials with both excellent selectivity and activity. Subsequent calculation results show that the maximum &#916;G change of the rate-determining step of Ta3(THT)2 is unexpectedly only 0.05 eV. Therefore, Ta3(THT)2 may be regarded as the NORR catalytic material with both excellent performance and selectivity. Based on the electron transfer and partial density of states (PDOS) analysis, it can be seen that Ta plays a crucial role in the activation stage of NO. The approach that considers the activity of the side reaction HER first may provide a new idea for rapidly screening highly selective and active NORR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Proton exchange membrane&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems for hydrogen production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cey2.629</link>
      <description>Yangyang Zhou, H. Zhong, Shanhu Chen, Guobin Wen, Liang Shen, Yanyong Wang, Ru Chen, Li Tao, Wang Shuangyin, Carbon Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403602672

                Abstract Hydrogen energy from electrocatalysis driven by sustainable energy has emerged as a solution against the background of carbon neutrality. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems represent a promising technology for hydrogen production, which is equipped to combine efficiently with intermittent electricity from renewable energy sources. In this review, PEM&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are summarized systematically from low to high operating temperature systems. When the operating temperature is below 130&#176;C, the representative device is a PEM water electrolyzer; its core components and respective functions, research status, and design strategies of key materials especially in electrocatalysts are presented and discussed. However, strong acidity, highly oxidative operating conditions, and the sluggish kinetics of the anode reaction of PEM water electrolyzers have limited their further development and shifted our attention to higher operating temperature PEM systems. Increasing the temperature of PEM&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems can cause an increase in current density, accelerate reaction kinetics and gas transport and reduce the ohmic value, activation losses, &#916; G H* , and power consumption. Moreover, further increasing the operating temperature (120&#8211;300&#176;C) of PEM&#8208;based devices endows various hydrogen carriers (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and ammonia) with electrolysis, offering a new opportunity to produce hydrogen using PEM&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems. Finally, several future directions and prospects for developing PEM&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems for H 2 production are proposed through devoting more efforts to the key components of devices and reduction of costs.</description>

                Abstract Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot&#8208;injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation&#8208;driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2 nm). Single&#8208;nanometer CoMn 2 O 4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88 V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9 mW cm &#8722;2 ) in zinc&#8211;air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure&#8211;property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.</description>

                We uncover the origin of unique electronic structures of single-atom alloys (SAAs) by interpretable deep learning. The approach integrates tight-binding moment theory with graph neural networks to accurately describe the local electronic structure of transition and noble metal sites upon perturbation. We emphasize the complex interplay of interatomic orbital coupling and on-site orbital resonance, which shapes the d-band characteristics of an active site, shedding light on the origin of free-atom-like d-states that are often observed in SAAs involving d10 metal hosts. This theory-infused neural network approach significantly enhances our understanding of the electronic properties of single-site catalytic materials beyond traditional theories.</description>

                Abstract Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, has been utilised in many engineering fields, such as computer engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering petroleum engineering. Bagging ensemble algorithms have been employed for parameter prediction, as they theoretically outperform traditional ML algorithms. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a strategy implemented to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. A vital aspect of CCS assessment is determining carbon storage capacity, which estimates the amount of CO2 that can be stored in the subsurface. Porosity is a critical parameter in calculating this capacity. In this study, the applicability of regression friendly bagging ensemble ML models; random forest regression (RFR) and extra tree regression (ETR) to estimate porosity of a sandstone layer as part of a CCS program was investigated. RFR models were developed considering caliper log (CAL), gamma ray log (GR), neutron log (NPHI), photoelectric factor log (PE) and deep laterolog (LLD) input features and calculated porosity as targets. Moreover, four traditional (classical) ML models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and decision tree regression (DTR), were developed to compare them with the bagging ensemble models. The results showed that the RFR model achieved a testing model R2 value of 0.9668, while ETR model achieved a resting model R2 value of 0.9569. The higher R2 value of the RFR model makes it a better choice for predicting porosity in CCS assessment projects. However, if computational time is a critical factor, ETR could be preferable, as it required only1/3 of the computational time that of the RFR model. Furthermore, when the performance of these models was compared with the four traditional ML models the two bagging ensembles distinctly outperformed the traditional models.</description>
