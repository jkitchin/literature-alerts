                Seamless management of atomistic data sets is a critical prerequisite for the successful development and deployment of machine learning potentials (MLPs). Here, we present dpdata, an open-source Python library designed to streamline every aspect of MLP data handling. Built upon a flexible, plugin-based architecture, dpdata supports reading, writing, and converting between a broad range of file formats&#9472;from popular quantum-chemistry packages and molecular-dynamics engines to specialized MLP frameworks. Users may define custom data types, formats, drivers, and minimizers, enabling effortless extension to emerging software. Key utilities include automated train-test splitting, coordinate perturbation for active learning, outlier-energy removal, &#916;-learning data set generation, error-metric computation, and unit conversion. Through efficient NumPy-backed storage and system-level operations, dpdata achieves significant memory saving and inference speedups over configuration-by-configuration tools such as ASE. We also highlight practical impact, with dpdata used across published studies, for format conversion, data storage, coordinate perturbation, and utilization in other projects for data processing.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent mechanism evolution on RhRu3Ox for acidic water oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64286-1</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction, as the anodic reaction of many electrochemical devices, plays a crucial role in energy conversion. However, the insufficient stability of non-iridium-based materials during the oxygen evolution reaction has severely limited the large-scale application of such devices. Here, using a home-made operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry system, we show a temperature dependent mechanism evolution effect of RhRu3Ox in the oxygen evolution process, which highlights the role of temperature in triggering mechanism evolution. This effect enriches the strategies for pathway manipulation. Since different kinetic pathways can influence catalyst stability, this finding suggests that temperature-dependent pathway regulation may serve as an approach to optimize stability. To evaluate the potential of RhRu3Ox for practical applications, we assemble it into a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and demonstrate its stability at room temperature for over 1000 hours at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory studies suggest that the existence of a kinetic barrier related to lattice oxygen activation might be the reason for the observed temperature dependent behavior of RhRu3Ox at elevated temperatures. The oxygen evolution reaction enables many clean energy technologies, but most acid-unstable catalysts still block deployment. Here the authors report a temperature dependent mechanistic evolution in RhRu3Ox that links reaction pathways to stability, enabling durable acidic water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Facile Single-Step Synthesis of PVP-Stabilized Ru NPs for Electrochemical Hydrogen Generation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5c02899</link>

                An efficient electrochemical hydrogen generation catalyst composed of robust ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) was synthesized through a simple one-pot hydrothermal reaction, where formaldehyde was employed as a reductant and low-molecular-weight poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) was employed as a stabilizing agent. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were initially characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, which confirmed their hexagonal, close-packed ruthenium phase. Structural analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which disclosed PVP-stabilized nanoflowers composed of Ru NPs with an average diameter of 5 nm. Further, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) confirmed the presence of ruthenium and carbon, and their oxidation states were also studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-synthesized PVP-supported Ru NPs exhibited remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, with overpotentials of 51 and 39 mV at a cathodic current density of &#8722;10 mA cm&#8211;2 and corresponding Tafel slopes of 23 and 40 mV dec&#8211;1 in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Such a high performance of the PVP-protected Ru NPs was further evaluated in a continuous manner by using an electrolyzer flow cell, and our findings were supported by the corresponding density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Calculations of the Gibbs free energy for varied surface coverage on the (002) facet revealed that the individual site activity improved with an increase in surface coverage, enhancing the continuous HER performance. Besides reinforcing the exploitation of eco-friendly raw materials for nanocatalyst development, this work serves as a prelude to our upcoming systematic investigations on the influence of the molecular weight of the PVP polymer on the size of metallic nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Transition-Metal Doped Armchair Hexagonal SiC Quantum Dots: Insights into Stability, Electronic Structure, and Optoelectronic Properties from First-Principles Calculations</title>

                Abstract The rational design of stable, earth-abundant quantum dots with tunable electronic and optical properties is crucial for advancing sustainable optoelectronic and photocatalytic technologies. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) is employed to investigate pristine and 3d transition-metal (TM)-doped armchair hexagonal silicon carbide quantum dots (AH-SiC-QDs, Si&#8325;&#8327;C&#8325;&#8327;H&#8323;&#8320;). Structural analysis reveals that pristine AH-SiC-QDs exhibit high stability (5.612 eV), surpassing previously reported SiC- and AlN-based QDs. Upon TM incorporation, stability remains robust, with Ni-doping providing the strongest binding and Sc-doping the weakest. Electronic structure calculations show significant dopant-induced modifications in HOMO&#8211;LUMO distributions and bandgaps, where Ti- and Sc-doped systems achieve remarkable bandgap narrowing (1.056 and 0.919 eV), enhancing electronic coupling with the host lattice. Optical absorption studies demonstrate pronounced red-shifts into the visible and near-infrared regions, with Sc- and V-doped systems offering extended light-harvesting potential. Mulliken charge and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses confirm strong donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, orbital rehybridization, and enhanced charge transfer, directly linking dopant chemistry to improved catalytic and optoelectronic behavior. These findings establish TM-doped AH-SiC-QDs as versatile and highly tunable platforms for next-generation photocatalysis and energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Strain&#8208;Tunable Bandgaps, Strong Light Absorption, and Active Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Light Metal&#8208;Decorated Borophene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/pssr.202500326</link>
      <description>Zhen Gao, Fengxian Ma, Yalong Jiao, physica status solidi (RRL) - Rapid Research Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415387753

                Current strategies for stabilizing 2D borophene sheets and compensating for boron's electron deficiency primarily rely on transition metals, many of which are heavy and costly, thereby limiting their practical applications. In contrast, the use of light&#8208;metal elements to stabilize borophene has remained largely unexplored. This work demonstrates that the light&#8208;metal beryllium (Be) can effectively stabilize 2D boron sheets. Through swarm&#8208;intelligence structural searches combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, three stable monolayers of beryllium tetraboride (BeB 4 )&#8212;the &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phases&#8212;are predicted. The &#945;&#8208;BeB 4 phase is metallic, while &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;BeB 4 are indirect semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.39 and 1.65 eV, respectively. Notably, biaxial strain can reversibly tune &#946;&#8208;BeB 4 between semiconducting and metallic states. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;BeB 4 exhibits a high visible&#8208;light absorption coefficient (3.80 &#215; 10 5 cm &#8722; 1 ) and an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane negative Poisson's ratio, indicating auxetic behavior. Remarkably, &#945;&#8208;BeB 4 demonstrates a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption, suggesting excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These unique properties position BeB 4 monolayers as promising, lightweight, and cost&#8208;effective candidates for next&#8208;generation energy conversion and optoelectronic applications.</description>

                Abstract The efficient development of electrocatalysts for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has been greatly challenging due to the high stability of the N&#8801;N bond and the competitive interference from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work innovatively designs a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (g&#8208;C 16 N 19 ) with a super&#8208;large pore structure based on the self&#8208;doping strategy and first&#8208;principles calculations, and constructs TM@g&#8208;C 16 N 19 (TM = Ti &#8764; Au) single&#8208;atom catalyst systems. By establishing a &#8220;Four&#8208;Step&#8221; screening model, it is found that W@g&#8208;C 16 N 19 exhibits the best NRR catalytic performance, with an ultralow limiting potential (U L ) of &#8208;0.23 V. Combining electron structure analyses such as charge density difference, ICOHP value, Bader charge, and spin magnetic moment, the micro&#8208;mechanism of W@g&#8208;C 16 N 19 effectively activating the &#963;/&#960; bonds of N 2 molecules through strong d&#8208;p orbital hybridization is revealed. Furthermore, based on the pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;free energy results calculated by the constant potential model, pH&#8208;potential coupling analysis shows that the configuration has a decisive influence on activity: the E&#8208;I/S&#8208;V mode dominates in alkaline media, while the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;O pathway is predominant under acidic conditions. In the E&#8208;I configuration, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (PDS) of NRR decreases with the decrease of the electrode potential; conversely, the energy barrier of the PDS of NRR in the E&#8208;O/S&#8208;V/S&#8208;O configuration increases with the decrease of the electrode potential.</description>

                Abstract Accurately identifying and enhancing catalytic activity in metal&#8208;free, carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts remains a fundamental challenge, largely due to the difficulty of concurrently optimizing hydrophilicity and oxygen affinity at active sites. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;driven strategy is presented to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). By integrating hydrazone linkages with alkoxy&#8208;functionalized pore walls, a hydrophilic skeleton capable of forming tunable intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks is constructed. These interactions induce asymmetric electron distributions that enhance the simultaneous adsorption of water and oxygen molecules. Consequently, the hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs exhibit a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 V, outperforming all previously reported metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the improved activity originates from favorable * OOH and * OH adsorption energies at hydrogen&#8208;bonding centers, along with stabilized O 2 /H 2 O binding. This synergistic modulation of the local microenvironment&#8212;through hydrogen bonding and electronic structure engineering&#8212;affords enhanced activity, selectivity, and long&#8208;term durability. This work offers a rational design paradigm for advancing metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts toward sustainable energy conversion.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are widely used in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) due to their distinctive electronic configuration and coordination environment. However, designing catalysts with porous structures that provide more active sites is a challenge in practice. Herein, we utilized the porous network structure of melamine foam (MF) and high temperature calcination to increase the number of nickel atoms to promote the formation of Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; active sites, resulting in nitrogen-coordinated nickel SACs with high catalytic activity. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test demonstrates that the optimal calcination temperature of 900 &#176;C can achieve a Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; site content of 9.47 at.%, which is significantly higher than that of other temperature conditions. This confirms that the calcination temperature has a decisive regulatory effect on the nitrogen-doped configuration and the formation of active sites. Furthermore, MF facilitated efficient electron transfer, resulting in improved catalytic performance. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) could reach 91% at -0.66 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ Infrared Spectroscopy for real-time monitoring has demonstrated a linear relationship between Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the reaction intermediate &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO content, indicating that an elevated Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; content may facilitate the generation of more active sites and expedite the kinetic process of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination in the Ni-N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; surface is responsible for the superior catalytic activity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR due to the moderate adsorption strength of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;COOH with less negative U&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.87 V). This experiment provides an innovative way to increase the active site content of SACs in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.</description>

                The processes that determine the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on metal surfaces remain a topic of discussion despite their long-standing importance in improving the efficiency of hydrogen generation. A major cause of this uncertainty is the extreme heterogeneity of the environment at the water&#8211;metal interface, which complicates the construction of simple models. To make progress, computationally efficient modeling methods need to be developed to handle the intricate nature of the water interface. In this paper, we use an implicit electrolyte approach suitable for ab initio dynamics, which allows the surface chemistry to be explicitly modeled with density functional theory while approximating the electrolyte with a continuum method. This approach incorporates ionic screening in the electrolyte via a Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann model, enabling the modeling of charged electrochemical interfaces in a dynamic, fluctuating environment. Our results qualitatively reveal a new factor that is likely important in understanding the HER: the location and structure of the interface where hydrogen is generated differ from where protons are exchanged between the water and metal. In particular, hydrogen is generated in regions where the water density is low (i.e., where the water film has dewetted from the substrate), while the adatom&#8211;water exchange reaction occurs in regions of high water density. Thus, the diffusion of hydrogen between these regions needs to be considered in the overall kinetics and may be a rate-limiting step.</description>

      <title>Axial Fluorine-Modulated M-N &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; -C SACs for Electrochemical CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction: Mechanistic Insights into Ligand Interaction Strength</title>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on axial modification have received much attention with respect to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Revealing the action mechanism of ligands and, at the same time, constructing the interaction relationship between ligands and the structure and activity of catalysts can provide important guidance for the design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the CO2RR. In this paper, the mechanism of the reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) on 19 transition metal-coordinated nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N4-C) and axial F atom modified M-N4-C (M-N4F-C) was studied through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the influence of axial F atoms on M-N4F-C catalytic activity was further revealed. The electrocatalytic reduction activity of M-N4-C SACs toward CO2 depends strongly on the outermost d-shell electron number and electronegativity of the selected metal. The incorporation of axial atoms alters the coordination structure and charge distribution of the central metal atoms, which not only enhances the stability (especially the electrochemical stability) of the M-N4F-C SACs but also modulates the adsorption strength of the intermediate species, thereby either increasing or decreasing the catalytic activity. The catalytic activity is determined by the intrinsic properties of the ligands and metal atoms. Four SACs (Mn-N4-C, Zn-N4-C, Co-N4F-C, and Ru-N4F-C) that can be utilized for the CO2RR are used in the experiments, exhibiting remarkable catalytic activity and stability. Importantly, the electronegativity of the ligands (&#951;ACL), the number of lone pairs of electrons in the ligand (m), and the electronegativity of the central metal atom (&#951;M) are proposed as key factors to describe the interaction relationship between the ligand and the metal center. Based on these parameters, a ligand interaction strength (&#955;) is introduced to quantitatively evaluate this interaction. Furthermore, several ligands with different &#955; values (CN &lt; F &lt; O &lt; N) were employed for axial modification, demonstrating that &#955; can effectively elucidate the influence of ligands on the geometric and electronic structures of SACs. By correlating &#955; with the adsorption energy of critical intermediate *OCHO, V-N4CN-C, Cr-N4CN-C, and Mo-N4CN-C were identified as promising electrocatalysts for the CO2RR. Our study provides useful guidance for understanding the influence of axial ligands on the electrocatalytic CO2RR and for designing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts.</description>

                Combining the numerous advantages of copper foil and borophene, the electrochemical performance of copper foil-supported borophene loaded with 4d transition-metal single-atom catalysts (CF@&#945;-B_TM) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated using density functional theory (DFT). We systematically analyze the CF@&#945;-B_TM catalyst stability, electronic properties, and catalytic activity in the hydrogen-oxygen electrode reaction. In the oxygen electrode reaction, as the atomic number of the loaded metal atoms increases, the adsorption energy of intermediates on CF@&#945;-B-TM gradually increases, while the adsorption ability gradually decreases. Afterward, it was calculated that the OH-modified CF@&#945;-B_Rh_OH exhibited excellent ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic activities with ORR and OER overpotentials of 0.35 and 0.47 V. In the hydrogen electrode reaction, CF@&#945;-B_Mo exhibited high HER catalytic activities with overpotentials of 0.05 V.</description>

                Abstract The kinetics of sulfur catalytic reactions serve as a fundamental cornerstone for maximizing both the capacity and stability of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Recently, investigations into Li&#8208;S catalysts predominantly center around the optimization of energy levels to bolster adsorption and catalytic conversion processes. However, a significant oversight persists, as the profound influence of electron spin states on charge transfer dynamics and orbital interactions is frequently neglected. Herein, NH 4 MnF 3 is synthesized as a sulfur host due to the strongly polarized Mn&#8208;F bonds, which generate a stronger ligand field and endow it with remarkable electrochemical activity. By capitalizing on the electric field&#8208;induced effect exerted by adjacent Co atoms, the crystal structure of NH 4 MnF 3 is optimized, successfully inducing spin&#8208;orbit splitting at the Mn centers. This achievement significantly enhances the overlap with the p z orbitals of polysulfides, effectively expediting the kinetic processes of sulfur redox reactions within LSBs. Notably, the Co&#8208;NH 4 MnF 3 demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance. Specifically, at a high rate of 2 C, it retains a remarkable specific capacity of 686 mAh g &#8722;1 even after 1000 cycles. This work unveils the pivotal role played by the electron spin states of active centers in sulfur catalytic conversion.</description>

                A design strategy of metal-boron (M-B) hybrid dual-atom catalysts (HDACs) anchored on g-C2N (M-B@C2N) and a mechanism of protonated N&#8801;N bond breaking promoting C-N coupling has been proposed for electrocatalytic reduction of N2 to urea with CO (NCR). Using density functional theory calculations, the stability, activity, and selectivity of 13 M-B@C2N HDACs are systematically evaluated. V-B@C2N has been screened as an excellent HDAC using a four-step screening strategy. N2 can be adsorbed on V and B atoms of V-B@C2N with a side-on configuration, and it can be activated by reversible dynamic evolution of the interatomic distance between the V and B atoms and by charge transport differences between the two N atoms and V-B sites. The inert N&#8801;N bond is gradually weakened by two successive protonation steps until broken to form 2*NH with a kinetic energy barrier of 0.72 eV, further promoting two-step C-N coupling of 2*NH and *CO coadsorbed on V-B sites to form *NHCONH with kinetic energy barriers of 0.08 and 0.03 eV. V-B@C2N not only exhibits excellent activity and selectivity for urea electrosynthesis with a limiting potential of only -0.44 V but also suppresses the competitive N2 reduction (NRR) and hydrogen evolution reactions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Catalytic Activity and Selectivity by Tuning the Coordination Environment of Cu Embedded on the WX &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X&#9552;S, Se, and Te) Monolayer for the Nitric Oxide Reduction Reaction: Insights from the DFT Approach</title>

                In this work, the effect of the coordination environment in Cu embedded in an X-vacant WX2 (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayer for the electrochemical NO reduction reaction (NORR) is investigated using the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) approach. The stability of the Cu-WX2 single-atom catalyst (SAC), NO adsorption configurations, and different reaction pathways for the electroreduction of NO to NH3 are systematically examined. The catalytic activity and NH3 selectivity are investigated at both low and high NO coverages by analyzing various descriptors such as the density of states, charge density difference, crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP), and Gibbs free energy change. The major NORR competing with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also the byproducts like N2O and N2 formation are greatly suppressed by our Cu-WX2 SACs. Among three different SACs, Cu-WTe2 shows an excellent catalytic performance with the lowest limiting potential of &#8722;0.26 V, which follows the most favorable N-distal reductive pathway in their free energy profile. Overall, our results may pave the way for developing a single-atom catalyst under ambient conditions for ammonia synthesis and also offer directions for the rational design of a highly efficient NORR electrocatalyst.</description>

                Abstract The chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anodic process in the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but relies heavily on dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) containing high&#8208;loadings of expensive noble metal oxides. To address this challenge, herein, a comprehensive big data analysis encompassing a broad set of the reported CER experiments to date, combined with catalytic volcano modeling is conducted using binding energy as a key descriptor. Leveraging these data&#8208;driven and theoretical insights, highly efficient non&#8208;precious single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is designed for CER. Among them, the predicted NiN 3 O&#8208;O SAC exhibited remarkable catalytic activity and selectivity, as confirmed by subsequent proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments. Under acidic conditions (1 M NaCl, pH 0.9), NiN 3 O&#8208;O demonstrates a low overpotential of 75 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and an exceptional Cl 2 selectivity of 95.8%, surpassing commercial DSA electrodes. Mechanistic investigations further reveal that the on&#8208;top oxygen (O ot ) in NiN 3 O&#8208;O serves as the active center, with a strong preference for chloride ion adsorption over competing intermediates, which underlies its superior catalytic performance. This work establishes non&#8208;precious SACs as highly effective CER catalysts, opening a promising avenue for the development of cost&#8208;effective and efficient CER electrocatalysts.</description>

                (Scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) has significantly advanced materials science but faces challenges in correlating precise atomic structure information with the functional properties of devices due to its time-intensive nature. To address this, an analytical workflow is introduced for the holistic characterization, modelling, and simulation of device heterostructures. This workflow automates the experimental (S)TEM data analysis, providing an in-depth characterization of crystallographic information, 3D orientation, elemental composition, and strain distribution. It reduces a process that typically takes days for a trained human into an automatic routine solved in minutes. Utilizing a physics-guided artificial intelligence model, it generates representative descriptions of materials and samples. The workflow culminates in creating digital twins of systems limited with at least one axis of translational invariance -3D finite element and atomic models of millions of atoms-enabling simulations that provide crucial insights into device behavior in practical applications. Demonstrated with SiGe planar heterostructures for scalable spin qubits, the workflow links digital twins to theoretical properties, revealing how atomic structure impacts materials and functional properties such as spatially-resolved phononic or electronic characteristics, or (inverse) spin orbit lengths. The versatility of the workflow is demonstrated through its application to a wide array of materials systems, device configurations, and sample morphologies.</description>

      <title>Topological Duality: Constructing High&#8208;Nuclearity Metal Clusters with Unleashed Active Sites for Efficient and Durable CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>

                Precise control of active sites with atomic resolution in metal nanoclusters (MNCs) presents a promising avenue for catalyst engineering towards CO2 electroreduction. However, effective strategies to construct high-nuclearity MNCs while balancing catalytic stability and active-site exposure remain scarce. Herein, we propose a "topological-duality-driven" strategy to construct a high-nuclearity Cu24Ag54 nanocluster, featuring an octahedral {Cu24} shell and a double-truncated cubic {Ag54} core with exposed {Ag3} vertices on {111} facets. Notably, the double-truncated cubic is a previously unexplored concave polyhedron with over twice the number of {111} facets compared to conventional structures. As a catalyst for CO2 electroreduction, Cu24Ag54 delivers exceptional performance including a Faradaic efficiency for CO of &#8764;98%, catalytic stability exceeding 100 h, and current densities up to 750 mA cm-2 (total current 3 A), ranking among the highest values of the reported MNCs. Dedicated studies show the nested structure and increased electron delocalization underpin the catalyst durability. The facilitated electron transfer from Ag to the key intermediate *COOH and electron delocalization effect significantly reduce the energy barrier for *COOH formation by 50%. This work provides a new perspective on the potential of topological geometries in designing high-nuclearity MNCs for highly efficient and robust CO2 electroreduction at industrial current density.</description>

                A design methodology is presented here for MoTex/Ni(OH)2 heterostructured catalysts that enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. This approach relies on the transfer of mechanically exfoliated MoTe2 nanosheets to Au/Si substrates followed by electrochemical Te dissolution to induce defect-mediated, partial semiconducting (2H) to metallic (1T') phase transitions. Immersing the resulting MoTex into a nickel nitrate hydrate solution results in a heterostructure consisting of 2H-MoTex/Ni(OH)2 and 1T'-MoTex/Ni(OH)2 domains, which enables high stability and improved efficiency for the OER compared to IrOx. Both machine-learning potential and density functional theory calculations searched and evaluated all atomic sites for this materials system, thus revealing the enhancement mechanisms of OER via four-electron transfer processes with lowered free energy barriers in the rate-determining steps.</description>

      <title>Elastic Properties of Defective 2D Polymers from Regression Driven Coarse-Graining</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01339</link>

                Two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) are an interesting class of polymers due to their reticular synthetic assembly, which make them an ideal platform for designing materials with specific target properties. Predicting and understanding their elastic behavior is crucial for their application. However, a realistic calculation of their properties remains computationally challenging due to the ubiquitous presence of defects in synthesized 2DPs. Here, we introduce a coarse-graining (CG) approach based on elastic beams called MikadoRR with parameters extracted from a simple regression-based fitting. This approach allows us to accurately calculate the elastic properties of defective 2DPs up to the microscale. Furthermore, we show that design principles of 2DPs for tailored elastic properties can be derived from this CG model.</description>

                Abstract We investigate the emergence of Deep Learning as a technoscientific field, emphasizing the role of open labeled datasets. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we evaluate the role of datasets like Canadian Institute of Advanced Research - 10 classes (CIFAR-10) in advancing computer vision and object recognition, which are central to the Deep Learning revolution. Our findings highlight CIFAR-10&#8217;s crucial role and enduring influence on the field, as well as its importance in teaching ML techniques. Results also indicate that dataset characteristics such as size, number of instances, and number of categories, were key factors. Econometric analysis confirms that CIFAR-10, a small-but-sufficiently large open dataset, played a significant and lasting role in technological advancements and had a major function in the development of the early scientific literature as shown by citation metrics.</description>

                Artificial enzymatic electrochemistry has emerged as an effective method to extend the catalytic abilities of enzymes, further increasing selectivity and efficiency, while also addressing limitations with stability, substrate scope, and reaction scale. Bioelectrochemical methods are powerful analytical tools to understand and optimize the structure and function of artificial enzymes. However, advancements in this field are hindered by the challenges of practical implementation and insufficient foundational knowledge required for effective integration of biological and electrochemical techniques. This review aims to provide clear examples of artificial enzymatic electrochemistry with an emphasis on the techniques and data that can be obtained for each example. Additionally, we provide an overview of enzymatic electrochemistry experimental design to encourage the incorporation of these techniques into future enzymology research. The review concludes by discussing the outlook and perspective on future opportunities for development.</description>

                Abstract Seawater electrolysis offers a sustainable route for hydrogen production but challenges, including sluggish water dissociation, chloride&#8208;induced poisoning, and metal hydroxide precipitation. Combinations of 36 three cost&#8208;effective host metals (Co, Ni, Cu) and twelve oxophilic dopants are screened to optimize alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, stability, and seawater compatibility. Oxophilic dopants improve water dissociation and chloride resistance but may accelerate hydroxide accumulation. Computational screening identified Ni&#9472;V, Ni&#9472;Mo, and Co&#9472;V as top candidates. Subsequent experiments confirmed Ni 20 V exhibits superior HER activity, achieving 76 mV lower overpotential than Pt/C at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. In the overall water splitting system, it retained excellent durability with only an 81 mV increase after 200 h. Moreover, Ni 20 V achieved a price activity of 801.2 A $ &#8722;1 at 1.9 V, which is nearly 1000 times higher than commercial Pt/C. This work advances cost&#8208;effective, durable alternatives to Pt&#8208;based HER catalysts for seawater electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Dual-Pathway Redox-Targeting Catalysis Promoting Electrochemical Kinetics for Bromine-Based Flow Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c12435</link>
      <description>Qianyun Wang, Qiming Zhang, Jianwei Wang, Zhikang Zhou, Fuming Lai, Kedi Cai, Qinzhi Lai, Qian Wang, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415545222

                Bromine-based flow battery (BFB) boasts numerous merits of high energy density, intrinsic safety, and low cost, making it highly promising in the field of large-scale energy storage. However, the inferior activity and significant permeation of the bromine cathode severely hinder its commercialization. Herein, a Prussian blue analogue Co2Fe(CN)6 (CoHCF) coated with a nitrogenous carbon composite (CoHCF@NC) is designed to catalyze the redox-targeting reactions at the bromine cathode. The cationic pairs of CoIII/CoII and the anionic pairs of FeIII(CN)6/FeII(CN)6 in CoHCF are both coupled with Br2/Br&#8211; in the redox potential range, which enables a two-pathway redox-targeting catalysis for the bromine cathode, thereby remarkably promoting the electrochemical kinetics. Besides, the ZIF-derived nitrogenous carbon (NC) framework guarantees smooth electron transmission for the uniformly embedded CoHCF catalyst. Consequently, the zinc&#8211;bromine flow battery assembled with CoHCF@NC catalyst delivers an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 86.1% and 65.3% at 80 and 200 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, and maintains a stable operation for 300 cycles at 80 mA cm&#8211;2. This work proposes a design strategy to enhance the redox-targeting catalysis, effectively improving the practical performance of BFB.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Accelerating Energy Materials Discovery: Bridging Quantum Accuracy with Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202503356</link>
      <description>Kwang S. Kim, Advanced Energy Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415545508

                Abstract Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized energy materials discovery through two key paradigms: ML potentials enabling quantum&#8208;accurate atomistic simulations with 2&#8208;4 orders of magnitude speedup over density functional theory, and ML&#8208;driven screening that efficiently navigates vast chemical spaces for rapid materials optimization. Advanced approaches, including graph neural networks and sparse Gaussian process regression incorporate physical symmetries and conservation laws, going beyond traditional statistical methods. Applications span battery materials, electrocatalysts, solar cells, phase change memory, and hydrogen storage systems, enabling simulations of thousands of atoms over extended timescales beyond the reach of quantum mechanical methods. Together, these complementary ML approaches enable predictive computational models spanning atomic to macroscopic scales. Current challenges include data quality, extrapolation to new chemical spaces, and physical interpretability. Emerging solutions involve equivariant architectures, active learning strategies, and physics&#8208;informed neural networks. The convergence of ML methodologies with experimental workflows can accelerate materials discovery and optimization. This addresses critical sustainable energy challenges in conversion, storage, and utilization while supporting the development of autonomous discovery platforms. In this way, ML helps overcome computational limitations in multiscale energy materials research and supports the efficient design of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Catalysis Understanding via Large Language Model Data Extraction and Shallow Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.5c01087</link>
      <description>Brianna R. Farris, Kevin C. Leonard, JACS Au. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415398029

                Catalysis is inherently complex. The lack of precise knowledge available to experimental researchers about the microenvironment, catalytic sites, mechanisms, and changes that occur under reaction conditions has hindered the effectiveness of deep-learning artificial intelligence algorithms to predict catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. Given the type and quality of data available in the scientific literature, there are still open questions on how machine learning can be used by experimentalists working in the field of catalysis to accelerate catalyst design. Here, we present a framework that leverages large language models to extract textual data from known and trusted sources to automatically generate large, but relatively low-fidelity, experimental catalysis data sets across many research groups. We also show that instead of using deep-learning models, which require high-quality data, shallow learning models with posthoc interpretability can extract valuable information about experimental catalytic systems from these low-fidelity data sets. The innovation of this work lies not in the model development but in the prompt engineering, data encoding, and question architectures employed to extract meaningful information. We applied this framework to two different model reactions: the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide and the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. We showcase that this framework has the ability to uncover known and established facts within the catalysis community, such as the catalytic properties of Cu, as well as novel insights, including the critical role of voltages above a certain threshold in producing multicarbon products from CO2. We anticipate that this proposed framework will serve as an entryway for experimental catalytic researchers to utilize machine learning to rapidly process literature, generate novel hypotheses, and design experiments to accelerate catalyst development.</description>

      <title>Alchemical diastereomers from antisymmetric alchemical perturbations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0283286</link>
      <description>O. Anatole von Lilienfeld, Giorgio Domenichini, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(16)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415425006

                The energy difference between two iso-electronic systems can be approximated by the first order Hellmann&#8211;Feynman derivative with respect to the linear alchemical coupling parameter, evaluated using the electron density of the corresponding averaged Hamiltonian. This approximation is exact up to third order because even-order contributions cancel out. This finding holds for any iso-electronic compound pair (dubbed &#8220;alchemical diastereomers&#8221;), regardless of differences in configuration, composition, or energy, and consequently, relative energy estimates for all possible iso-electronic alchemical diastereomer pairs require only O(1) self-consistent field cycles for any given averaging reference Hamiltonian. We discuss the relation to the Verlet algorithm, alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) [Krug et al., J. Chem. Phys. 162, 044101 (2025)], relative properties such as forces, ionization potential or electron affinities, and Levy&#8217;s formula for relative energies among iso-electronic systems that uses the averaged electron density of the two systems [Levy, J. Chem. Phys. 70, 1573 (1979)]. Density functional theory based estimates accurately reflect trends in the charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomic molecule series with 14 protons (N2, CO, BF, BeNe, LiNa, HeMg, HAl), with systematically increasing errors. Using alchemical Hellmann&#8211;Feynman derivatives for toluene, we demonstrate the concept&#8217;s broader applicability by estimating relative energies for all 36 possible alchemical diastereomer pairs from vertical iso-electronic charge-neutral antisymmetric BN doping of toluene&#8217;s aromatic ring, with mean absolute errors of a few milli-Hartrees.</description>

      <title>tmQMg* Data Set: Excited State Properties of 74k Transition Metal Complexes</title>

      <description>Hannes Kneiding, David Balcells, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415511040

                The application of machine learning approaches to meaningful problems in chemistry and materials science is still challenged by the limited availability of data. In order to close this gap, we report the tmQMg* data set, which provides excited state properties for 74k mononuclear transition metal complexes extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database. All properties were computed at the TD-DFT &#969;B97xd/def2SVP level of theory. The strongest electron excitations in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges are included, together with the wavelengths and intensities of the first 30 excited states. Further, natural transition orbitals were computed for the strongest excitations in the visible range to determine the nature of the associated charge transfers. By computing the TD-DFT spectra in both gas phase and acetone, we quantified solvatochromic effects, which are also provided with the data set, in terms of both wavelength shifts and intensity changes. The tmQMg* data set will enable the development of discriminative and generative artificial intelligence models with respect to absorption spectra, charge transfer character, and solvatochromism, enabling novel advances in the field of transition metal photochemistry.</description>
