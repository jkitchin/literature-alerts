                Magneto-ionics, which refers to the modification of the magnetic properties of materials through electric-field-induced ion migration, is emerging as one of the most promising methods to develop nonvolatile energy-efficient memory and spintronic and magnetoelectric devices. Herein, the controlled generation of ferromagnetism from paramagnetic Co&#8211;Ni oxide patterned microdisks (prepared upon thermal oxidation of metallic microdisks with dissimilar Co&#8211;Ni ratios, i.e., Ni25Co75 and Ni50Co50) is demonstrated under the action of voltage. The effect is related to the partial reduction of the oxide phases to their metallic forms. Samples richer in Co show stronger magneto-ionic activity, which manifests in lower-onset threshold voltages, faster switching rates, and larger values of the attained saturation magnetization. By means of scanning electron microscopy, a cobalt segregation phenomenon has been experimentally observed upon thermal oxidation, which has been theoretically discussed from the diffusivities' viewpoint. X-ray diffraction characterization has revealed transitions between purely mixed Ni and Co oxides, in the OFF state, to a mixture of oxide and metallic phases, in the ON state, because of the oxygen ion motion outward/inward the Co&#8211;Ni oxide microdisks, depending on the voltage polarity. Ab initio calculations reveal that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy migration is lower in CoO than in NiO, in agreement with the obtained magneto-ionic responses. The observation of magneto-ionic effects in patterned disks (and not only in archetypical continuous films) is a step further for the practical utilization of this phenomenon in real miniaturized devices.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have the potential to act as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts for the oxygen&#8208;redox reactions in metal&#8208;air batteries. However, achieving both high performance and stability in these SACs has been challenging. Here, a novel and facile synthesis method is used to create cobalt&#8208;doped&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon structures (Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) containing cobalt&#8208;SACs by carbonizing a modified ZIF&#8208;11. HAADF&#8208;STEM images and EXAFS spectra confirmed that the structure with the lowest cobalt concentration contains single cobalt atoms coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (Co&#8208;N&#8324;). Electrochemical tests showed that this electrocatalyst performed exceptionally well in both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (E1/2 &#8776; 0.859 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (Ej = 10: 1.544 V), with excellent stability. When used as a bi&#8208;functional electrocatalyst in the air cathode of a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB), a peak power density of 178.6.1 mW cm &#8722;2 , a specific capacity of 799 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 and a cycle&#8208;life of 1580 is achieved. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the concentration and the position of the pyridinic nitrogen with Co play a critical role in determining the overpotential of this electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;redox reactions. The unprecedented performance of this electrocatalyst can bring paradigm changes in the practical realization and application of metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Atomic Adsorption Energies Prediction on Bimetallic Transition Metal Surfaces Using an Interpretable Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Density Functional Theory Approach</title>

                Abstract In this study, we identified features with the largest contributions and property trends in predicting the adsorption energies of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen adsorbates on transition metal (TM) surfaces by performing Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;based calculations and Machine Learning (ML) regression models. From 26 monometallic and 400 bimetallic fcc(111) TM surfaces obtained from Catalysis&#8208;hub.org, three datasets consisting of fourteen elemental, electronic, and structural properties were generated using DFT calculations, site calculations, and online databases. The number of features was reduced using feature selection and then finely&#8208;tuned random forest regression (RFR), gaussian process regression (GPR), and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were implemented for adsorption energy prediction. Finally, model&#8208;agnostic interpretation methods such as permutation feature importance (PFI) and shapely additive explanations (SHAP) provided rankings of feature contributions and directional trends. For all datasets, RFR and GPR demonstrated the highest prediction accuracies. In addition, interpretation methods demonstrated that the largest contributing features and directional trends in the regression models were consistent with structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships of TMs like the d&#8208;band model, the Friedel model, and higher&#8208;fold adsorption sites. Overall, this interpretable ML&#8211;DFT approach can be applied to TMs and their derivatives for atomic adsorption energy prediction and model explainability.</description>

      <description>Kensaku Kodama, Naoto Todoroki, Small Methods. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407049795

                Abstract Hydrogen plays a key role in maximizing the benefits of renewable energy, and the widespread adoption of water electrolyzers and fuel cells, which convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and electrical energy into each other, is strongly desired. Electrocatalysts used in these devices, typically in the form of nanoparticles, are crucial components because they significantly affect cell performance, but their raw materials rely on limited resources. In catalyst research, electrochemical experimental studies using model catalysts, such as single&#8208;crystal electrodes, have provided valuable information on reaction and degradation mechanisms, as well as catalyst development strategies aimed at overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and durability, across spatial scales ranging from the atomic to the nanoscale. Traditionally, these experiments are conducted using well&#8208;defined, simple model surfaces like bare single&#8208;crystal electrodes in pure systems. However, in recent years, experimental methods using more complex interfaces&#8212;while still precisely controlling elemental distribution, microstructure, and modification patterns&#8212;have been established. This paper reviews the history of those studies focusing on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions and oxygen evolution reactions, which account for the majority of efficiency losses in fuel cells and water electrolyzers, respectively. Furthermore, potential future research themes in experimental studies using model electrodes are identified.</description>

      <title>Electronic descriptors for designing high-entropy alloy electrocatalysts by leveraging local chemical environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56421-9</link>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) present a vast compositional space for fine-tuning electrocatalytic activities, leveraging millions of distinct active sites on the surface. However, the intricate local chemical environment poses challenges to the rational and efficient design of HEA electrocatalysts with high reactivity. Here, focusing on noble-metal HEAs for oxygen reduction reactions, we propose a straightforward yet effective descriptor for quantitively determining the local reactivities of HEAs. This descriptor is based on a linear combination of the intrinsic d-band filling of the active center and the neighborhood electronegativity. Our model offers an accurate and robust description of the binding strengths of intermediates with different adsorption configurations on HEAs, supported by external density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the local environmental electronegativity of the HEA surface is strongly related to the d-band profile of the center atom(s) embedded within. Finally, we establish a library of activity maps for HEAs encompassing nine noble-metal elements, suggesting that Pd-rich and Ir-rich alloys, such as Pd&#8211;Ag, Ir&#8211;Pt, Ir&#8211;Au compositions, hold promise as potential candidates for optimal electrocatalysts. High entropy alloys hold promises for enhanced oxygen reduction reaction. Here, the authors develop a straightforward yet effective descriptor for rational designing high entropy alloy electrocatalysts with the aid of surface local chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Predicting electrocatalytic urea synthesis using a two-dimensional descriptor</title>

                Electrochemical synthesis routes powered by renewable electricity can provide sustainable chemical commodities by replacing conventional fossil-based processes. Increasing research focuses on value-added chemicals like the indispensable fertilizer urea, which also constitutes a study case for electrochemical CN-coupling. To guide the identification of highly selective catalysts, we aim to provide new insight by analysing existing experimental data on the selectivity of transition metal catalysts towards electrochemically synthesized urea. Firstly, we project high dimensional experimental data using principal component analysis (PCA) to lower dimensions, and thereby confirm that urea selectivity is correlated with the selectivity towards CO and NH3. Furthermore, we identified the most suitable two-dimensional descriptors for selectivity prediction out of various adsorption energies calculated using density functional theory (DFT). We suggest that the adsorption energies of *H and *O on transition metal slabs predict the selectivity towards urea in the co-reduction of CO2 and nitrite ( $${{\rm{NO}}}_{2}^{-}$$ ). Electrochemical synthesis routes powered by renewable electricity can provide sustainable chemical commodities by replacing conventional fossil-based processes. Here, the authors employ computational methods to provide new insight towards the identification of highly selective catalysts, by analysing existing experimental data on the selectivity of transition metal catalysts towards electrochemically synthesized urea.</description>

      <title>Breaking linear scaling relationships in oxygen evolution via dynamic structural regulation of active sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55150-9</link>
      <description>Zheye Zhang, Hongyan Zhao, Shibo Xi, Xiaoxu Zhao, Xiao Chi, Hong Bin Yang, Zhongxin Chen, Xiaojiang Yu, Yang&#8208;Gang Wang, Bin Liu, Peng Chen, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407087380

                The universal linear scaling relationships between the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates limit the performance of catalysts in multi-step catalytic reactions. Here, we show how these scaling relationships can be circumvented in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction by dynamic structural regulation of active sites. We construct a model Ni-Fe2 molecular catalyst via in situ electrochemical activation, which is able to deliver a notable intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity. Theoretical calculations and electrokinetic studies reveal that the dynamic evolution of Ni-adsorbate coordination driven by intramolecular proton transfer can effectively alter the electronic structure of the adjacent Fe active centre during the catalytic cycle. This dynamic dual-site cooperation simultaneously lowers the free energy change associated with O&#8211;H bond cleavage and O&#8211;O bond formation, thereby disrupting the inherent scaling relationship in oxygen evolution reaction. The present study not only advances the development of molecular water oxidation catalysts, but also provides an unconventional paradigm for breaking the linear scaling relationships in multi-intermediates involved catalysis. Circumventing linear scaling relationships in multi-step catalytic reactions is meaningful but challenging. Here, the authors report a method to break this scaling relationship in the oxygen evolution reaction through dynamic regulation of the active site in a Ni-Fe molecular complex catalyst.</description>

      <title>Bias Dependence of the Transition State of the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

                The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the most prominent electrocatalytic reactions of green energy transition. However, the kinetics across materials and electrolyte pH and the impact of hydrogen coverage at high current densities remain poorly understood. Here, we study the HER kinetics over a large set of nanoparticle catalysts in industrially relevant acidic and alkaline membrane electrode assemblies that are only operated with pure water humidified gases. We discover distinct kinetic fingerprints between the iron triad (Fe, Ni, Co), coinage (Au, Cu, Ag), and platinum group metals (Ir, Pt, Pd, Rh). Importantly, the applied bias changes not only the activation energy (EA) but also the pre-exponential factor (A). We interpret these changes as entropic changes in the interfacial solvent that differ between acid and base and entropic changes on the surface due to a changing hydrogen coverage. Finally, we observe that anions can induce Butler&#8211;Volmer behavior for the coinage metals in acid. Our results provide a new foundation to understand HER kinetics and, more broadly, highlight the pressing need to update common understanding of basic concepts in the field of electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) employing Ir/Ru&#8208;free anodes emerges as a bright prospect for green hydrogen society. Here, a Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 nanosheet electrocatalyst is reported, in situ grown on stainless&#8208;steel paper, as an efficient and durable self&#8208;supporting AEMWE anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interstitial [MnSe 4 ] tetrahedra elevate the Fermi level and narrows the band gap of the electrocatalyst, thereby expediting electrode reaction kinetics and increasing the electrical conductivity. In addition, the interstitial Mn atoms attenuate the electron density of Ni and Fe and motivate phase transition to actual active (Mn, Fe)&#8208;doped &#947; &#8208;NiOOH species. The downward d &#8208;band center of Ni active center facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting * OOH desorption step, refreshing the active center, and reducing the free energy barriers for OER. Accordingly, the Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 electrode achieves OER overpotentials of 149 and 232 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. The AEMWE cell incorporating Ni 0.8 Fe 0.2 Mn 0.1 Se 2 anode demonstrates high performance (1.0 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.68 V cell ) and durability (at 1 A cm &#8722;2 for 300 h), surpassing most AEMWE cells that use NiFe&#8208;based anodes. This work highlights the potential of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anodes for efficient and durable AEMWE.</description>

                Abstract Six types of M x Sb y compounds (Fe, Co, and Ni antimonides) are synthesized in form of mono&#8208;dispersed nanocrystallites (NCs) via a hot&#8208;injection metathesis&#8208;reduction. Various contents of Sb atoms are found to drive crystallographic structure and re&#8208;coordination in the M x Sb y materials, leading to rhythmical changes of orthorhombic M 3 Sb&#8594;hexagonal MSb&#8594;monoclinic (or orthorhombic) MSb 2 . The crystallography is identified as crucial factor in electrocatalysis of water splitting at cathodic and anodic electrodes, respectively. Owning to the in&#8208;plane microstrain distributed along (001) plane, the synthesized Ni 3 Sb NCs are more suitable to catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), sharing overpotential (&#951; 10 ) of 93 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 with Tafel slope of 45 mV dec &#8722;1 , and extremely low hydrogen adsorption resistance (0.019 &#937;) is obtained. The orthorhombic FeSb 2 NCs featured with larger deprotonation capacity of 13.71 mC V &#8722;1 excelled in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrolysis, and is confirmed to facilitate minimal deformation of the OOH * . The integrated devices (FeSb 2 &#8214;Ni 3 Sb) are tested as efficient catalyst for overall water splitting (1.58 V@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with long stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidated the particular coordination of Sb with proper electronegativity (2.05) is able to adjust active sites, relax electronic attraction, and benefit electrochemical reactions.</description>

                Abstract An efficient approach for fabrication of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst is desirable for designing the energy storage and conversion devices in real&#8208;world usages due to low cost and excellent catalytic properties. The preparation of hollow carbon capsules (HCC) containing cobalt (Co)&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported by a simple synthesis process without using templates for the first time. Initially, cobalt phenylphosphonate (Co&#8208;MOF) nanorods are fabricated through a simple hydrothermal approach. The as&#8208;formed Co&#8208;MOF is covered with a thin coating of polydopamine (DP&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF) through chemical polymerization of dopamine in Tris&#8208;HCl (pH 8.5). The DP&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF is used as self&#8208;degraded template for the formation of HCC under pyrolysis. The formation mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of HCC are investigated. The hollow structure derived under N 2 exhibits a low overpotential (295 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with excellent stability (90.98%) for 150 h, which is further verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, the designed anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer based on C&#9472;Co&#9472;N as cathode delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 (at 2.19 V) and 1000 mAcm &#8722;2 (at 2.33 V) in 1.0 m KOH at 60 &#176;C. The fabricated new Co&#8208;based electrocatalyst is highly beneficial for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance AEMWEs.</description>

                A chemical recycling process that reduces polymers to their raw materials plays a crucial role in circular economy. To contribute to chemical recycling, this study proposes a system that simulates the process of depolymerization from polymer-to-monomer using reactive molecular dynamics (MD). Two MD methods, Reax force field (ReaxFF) and neural network potential (NNP), were employed to simulate the depolymerization of a polystyrene model. We validated the simulation accuracies by comparing monomer yields and decomposition products with experimental results. The results showed that NNP-MD accurately replicated the degradation and redecomposition processes and achieved consistency with the experimental data at various temperatures. ReaxFF-MD, however, was less able to represent the depolymerization process. We conclude that NNP-MD is capable of simulating polymer depolymerization results that are consistent with experimental observations. These results contribute to the development of methods for efficient chemical recycling and the broader realization of a circular economy.</description>

                In actual flight conditions, the surface of thermal protection materials may experience stress, and the impact of surface strain on catalytic reaction and mechanical&#8211;chemical coupling has not been fully explored. In this study, a surface gas&#8211;solid interaction model was constructed using reaction molecular dynamics and density functional theory methods. The surface catalytic reaction characteristics of &#945;-SiO2 (001) under up to 2% uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain were investigated. Results indicate that both uniaxial stretching along the X axis and biaxial stretching along the X and Y axes inhibit the catalytic recombination reaction at higher surface temperatures. For the uniaxial stretching model, when the strain reaches 2%, the catalytic coefficient decreases by 21.2%, whereas for the biaxial stretching model, it decreases by 34.3%. From the perspectives of surface morphology and energy, the study reveals that tensile strain reduces the undercoordination degree of Si atoms on the surface, reduces the surface energy of &#945;-SiO2 (001), increases the activation energy of the atomic oxygen recombination reaction, alters the recombination pathways of oxygen atoms, strain-induced selective desorption of oxygen atoms reduces the recombination probabilities of both Eley&#8211;Rideal and Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood pathways, ultimately decreasing the catalytic recombination coefficient.</description>

                The electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e-ORR) represents one of the most prospective avenues for the in situ synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the four-electron competition reaction constrains the efficiency of H2O2 synthesis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop superior catalysts to facilitate the H2O2 synthesis. In this study, graphite-phase carbon nitride and cerium dioxide composites (g-C3N4/CeO2) with varying CeO2 loadings were prepared with favorable 2e-ORR electrocatalysts. The optimized composite, containing 20 wt % CeO2 (g-C3N4/CeO2-20%) exhibited the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 97% and notable H2O2 yielding of 9.84 mol gcat.&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at the potential of 0.3 V (vs RHE) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the improvement of the selectivity and yield of H2O2 for the composites were attributed to the charge transfer between g-C3N4 and CeO2, which causes the active site C atom donating electrons to form C+, thereby enhancing the adsorption and desorption of *OOH intermediates. Additionally, the g-C3N4/CeO2-20% composite exhibits excellent 2e-ORR performance in neutral and acidic electrolytes and demonstrates superior capability in electro-Fenton degradation of organic pollutants. This study not only provides new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of g-C3N4/CeO2 composites but also demonstrates an effective method for designing 2e-ORR catalysts.</description>

      <title>ABFML: A problem-oriented package for rapidly creating, screening, and optimizing new machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0247559</link>
      <description>Xingze Geng, Jianing Gu, Gaowu Qin, Lin&#8208;Wang Wang, Xiangying Meng, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(5)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4407141817

                Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) require ongoing improvement and innovation to effectively address challenges across various domains. Developing MLFF models typically involves extensive screening, tuning, and iterative testing. However, existing packages based on a single mature descriptor or model are unsuitable for this process. Therefore, we developed a package named ABFML, based on PyTorch, which aims to promote MLFF innovation by providing developers with a rapid, efficient, and user-friendly tool for constructing, screening, and validating new force field models. Moreover, by leveraging standardized module operations and cutting-edge machine learning frameworks, developers can swiftly establish models. In addition, the platform can seamlessly transition to the graphics processing unit environments, enabling accelerated calculations and large-scale parallel simulations of molecular dynamics. In contrast to traditional from-scratch approaches for MLFF development, ABFML significantly lowers the barriers to developing force field models, thereby expediting innovation and application within the MLFF development domains.</description>

                Abstract The controlled formation of a functional adlayer at the catalyst&#8208;water interface is a highly challenging yet potentially powerful strategy to accelerate proton transfer and deprotonation for ultimately improving the performance of proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). In this study, the synthesis of robust vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possessing high proton conductivities is reported, which are subsequently hybridized with ruthenium dioxide yielding high&#8208;performance anodic catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ spectroscopic measurements corroborated by theoretical calculations reveal that the assembled hydrogen bonds formed between COFs and adsorbed oxo&#8208;intermediates effectively orient interfacial water molecules, stabilizing the transition states for intermediate formation of OER. This determines a decrease in the energy barriers of proton transfer and deprotonation, resulting in exceptional acidic OER performance. When integrated into a PEMWE device, the system achieves a record current density of 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 at only 1.54 V cell voltage, with a long&#8208;term stability exceeding 180 h at industrial&#8208;level 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . The approach relying on the self&#8208;assembly of an oriented hydrogen&#8208;bonded adlayer highlights the disruptive potential of COFs with customizable structures and multifunctional sites for advancing PEMWE technologies.</description>

                Abstract This current investigation evaluates the feasibility of employing potential adsorbents obtained from various biomass waste substances, namely, (i) coconut shell, (ii) rice husk, and (iii) eucalyptus wood, for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture applications. Activated carbons are obtained from abundantly available renewable biomass residues by single&#8208;stage activation. The adsorption properties are evaluated using advanced techniques. Further, the adsorbents are packed in an in&#8208;house fabricated post&#8208;combustion adsorption chamber. In this investigation, the feasibility of employing adsorbents for capturing CO 2 and NO by using an adsorption technique in a diesel engine&#8208;operated standby diesel generator set intended to supply electrical power to a guest house, hostels, faculty quarters, and residential area in an educational institution in India is investigated. Essential parameters such as (i) maximum adsorption capacity, (ii) fractional adsorption kinetics, (iii) regenerability and reusability, (iv) dynamic adsorption of the breakthrough curve, and (v) isosteric enthalpy of adsorption of adsorbent samples are also examined. Compared to the other adsorbents examined, eucalyptus wood adsorbent mitigates CO 2 and NO by 50% and 36% at full load, respectively.</description>

                Using quantum chemical modelling, in this work, we considered the structure effects determining the adsorption of H and O atoms on (111), (100), (110) and (211) surfaces of gold, nickel and platinum nanoparticles. Surface deformation enhanced the adatom bonding to active sites with a large coordination number on flat (111) and (100) surfaces, while no distinct tendency was observed on kinked (110) and (211) surfaces. The effect of the neighboring atoms depends on the coupling matrix element Vad2. For metals with a considerable matrix element, the adsorption energy decreases with the rise in coordination number, and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Structure Prediction of Ionic Epitaxial Interfaces with Ogre Demonstrated for Colloidal Heterostructures of Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c12713</link>

                Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers exciting opportunities to create a wide variety of functional heterostructures. However, assessing structural compatibility&#9472;the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth&#9472;is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters and crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end, we implemented developments tailored for the high-efficiency prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include the use of pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and the use of a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically calculated based on the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for perovskite-based CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in excellent agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Finally, combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface, and to assign a structure to several other reported metal halide- and oxide-based interfaces. The Ogre package is available on GitHub or via the OgreInterface desktop application, available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</description>
