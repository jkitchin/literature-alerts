                Strain is a widely used strategy for electrocatalyst engineering. Overstraining, however, can lead to unintentional materials transformation. We investigate the impact of strain on the surface morphology of a rutile RuO2(110) film grown on a symmetry-matching rutile TiO2(110) substrate. When the film thickness exceeds 9 nm, the RuO2 surface relaxes by forming step edges that expose the {011} plane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the (011) facet is among the lower energy surfaces of rutile RuO2, suggesting that this formation incurs minimal energetic penalties. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the film maintains the (110) structure of the terrace during electrochemistry. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) further reveals the insensitivity of the Ru dissolution to strain. Our findings show a strain-relieving pathway via surface reconstruction in RuO2(110) and provide an example of a strain-relieving mechanism that does not affect dissolution.</description>

                Abstract It is desirable but challenging to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) applications. In this work, a series of cerium oxide&#8208;coated cobalt vanadium oxide nanoplates (denoted as CVO@CeO 2 ) are prepared using different CeO 2 loadings through a facile two&#8208;step method. Compared to bare CVO, CeO 2, and commercial RuO 2 , the CVO@CeO 2 &#8208;0.20 catalyst presents much higher activity toward OER in alkaline solutions. Moreover, the CVO@CeO 2 &#8208;0.20 also exhibits superior open&#8208;circuit voltage and durability when utilized as the cathode in ZABs. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results disclose that the decoration of CeO 2 on CVO not only regulates the formation of high&#8208;spin state Co 3+ , optimizing the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, but also activates lattice oxygen, enhancing the lattice oxide oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway. This research presents the CVO@CeO 2 heterojunction as an excellent catalyst for the OER and proposes a promising interface&#8208;regulated strategy for developing catalysts based on the reinforcement of AEM and LOM mechanisms.</description>

                Abstract In this study, we employ the pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL) to tailor the surface properties of cobalt (II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) platelets grown in the &lt; 111 &gt; direction. By varying the laser intensity and pulse number, we systematically investigate the relationship between defect formation and catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and selective oxidation of two alcohols. Our results reveal that the PUDEL processing leads to the formation of lattice distortions, the gradual alteration of three different paramagnetic defect sites, a partial reduction of Co 3 O 4 , and enrichment of the Co 3 O 4 (111) surface with hydroxyl groups (*OH), which significantly enhances OER activity. Theoretical investigations confirm that optimized hydroxyl coverage is critical for determining OER activity. The observed trends in selectivity and conversion efficiency for the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol (CA) and ethylene glycol (EG) suggest different reaction mechanisms. The activity trend of the selective oxidation of CA appears to follow the trend of a defect&#8208;attributed paramagnetic species that was assigned to a surface&#8208;near, distorted high&#8208;spin (S = 3/2) Co 2+ . In turn, the catalytic activity and OER activity trends for the EG oxidation showed similar trends, which followed the density of a paramagnetic CoO x species observed during EPR spectroscopy. In particular, the highest OER activity and EG conversion were both found for moderate (2 PPV, ), yet not too intense PUDEL processing. Our findings establish PUDEL as a precise method for catalyst optimization, both for thermal and electro&#8208;catalytic oxidation over defect&#8208;enriched cobalt oxides, which enables the correlation of specific laser&#8208;induced defects with catalytic activity trends.</description>

      <title>Determining the Potential of Maximum Entropy from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adts.202500958</link>

                Abstract Understanding electrochemical interfaces at the atomic level is essential for optimizing catalytic performance in energy conversion and storage technologies. This study introduces a computational framework based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to predict the potential of maximum entropy (PME) a descriptor of electric double layer disorder and charge transfer efficiency. By integrating AIMD with the generalized computational hydrogen electrode, it is systematically investigated how electrolyte composition, cation identity, and pH effect the position of PME. The approach reproduces experimental shifts in PME for Au and Pt electrodes and provides unprecedented insights into the emergence of multiple PME values in mixed&#8208;cation systems. The findings challenge conventional models of electrolyte structuring by revealing the presence of multiple PME values within mixed&#8208;cation systems. This suggests a more complex interplay between cations, adsorbates, and interfacial disorder than previously assumed. The computational framework developed in this study provides a predictive tool for understanding these interactions, offering new strategies for tuning electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract The existence of Cl &#8722; in seawater electrolysis weakens the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and causes material failure by chlorine pitting. Introducing anion layers not only repels the transition of Cl &#8722; without retarding the diffusion of oxygen&#8208;containing anions but also can be generated in situ on the outer surface. Here, a hierarchical catalyst consisting of a MnO 2 layer formed on a Ni foam substrate covered uniformly by a nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) active layer is developed through interfacial electrostatic engineering. It was found that the introduced Lewis acid layer (MnO 2 ) can spontaneously generate OH &#8722; groups on the outer surface in situ to repel Cl &#8722; by electrostatic repulsion force. Meanwhile, Ni&#8208;active sites anchored inside the MnO 2 matrix can improve the low activity of MnO 2 . The multilayer NiFe&#8208;LDH@MnO 2 /NF anode can operate steadily at the current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at 70 &#176;C for 100 h and maintain 97.9% OER selectivity. Furthermore, the OER overpotential was reduced by 136 mV, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial Ni mesh in industrial environments, especially the device can be powered by wind energy. The work offers an efficient strategy for designing high&#8208;performance seawater electrolysis with low cost and high stability.</description>

                Abstract The development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) remain challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) at the cathode. In this context, a novel N&#8208;doped graphitic shell&#8208;encapsulated cobalt catalyst is presented as an air electrode with exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving an ORR half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 0.81 V and an OER overpotential of 349 mV in an alkaline medium. The catalyst demonstrated excellent cycling durability and delivered superior power density in both liquid and solid&#8208;state ZABs. Furthermore, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB is assembled with the catalyst, and it maintained a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.360 V for &gt;10 000 s. The catalyst achieved a peak power density of 127 mW cm &#8722;2 &#8212;significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C + RuO 2 system (74 mW cm &#8722;2 ). When two tandem&#8208;junction ZABs are connected in series, they achieved an OCV of 2.75 V and powering a &#8220;ZAB&#8221; LED strip and a mini fan. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the enhanced performance resulted from optimized binding energies between the Co@N(py) active sites and reaction intermediates. An in situ Raman study is carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism through transient intermediate detection.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bifunctional Electrocatalysts Through p&#8208;Block Metal Incorporation in Transition Metal Doped N&#8208;Graphene for Oxygen Evolution and Reduction Reactions</title>

                Abstract Development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for renewable energy storage and conversion technologies. While transition metal (TM) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;doped graphene systems (TM&#8208;N&#8208;G) are well&#8208;known for their electrocatalytic performance, their bifunctional activity for both OER and ORR remains limited and inefficient. In this work, bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of TM&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G systems (TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) is investigated by incorporating p&#8208;block metals (PM = Al, Ga, In, Sn, and Bi) into an N 4 cavity, resulting in TM&#8208;PM&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G structures. Systematic DFT calculations reveal that among all the system configurations, Co&#8208;Ga&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G and Co&#8208;Sn&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G emerge as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts. The enhanced catalytic activity of Co centres is attributed to optimal interactions with reaction intermediates, as elucidated by scaling relations, volcano plots, and contour maps. These optimal interactions are explained by changes in electronic structure of catalysts and charge redistribution at the TM sites, induced by incorporated PMs. A new descriptor &#978; is proposed to describe the catalytic activity, performing better than conventional d&#8208;band center. Additionally, several unifunctional catalysts are identified. This detailed analysis provides key insights and design strategies for developing high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts via PM doping in TM&#8208;N&#8208;G systems.</description>

                The nitrite electroreduction reaction (NO2RR) offers a green and sustainable pathway for environmental wastewater treatment and ammonia (NH3) generation. Herein, defect-rich trimetallic AuCuRh nanowires (AuCuRh NWs) with a large number of grain boundaries, twin boundaries, and atomic steps are successfully synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction. Due to its self-stability and high activity, AuCuRh NWs can efficiently drive the stable NO2RR at 0 V potential (Faradaic efficiency: 98.32%, NH3 yield rate: 20.49 mg h-1 mgcat -1). Moreover, AuCuRh NWs also reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity for the formaldehyde electrooxidation reaction (FOR), which can reach 10 mA cm-2 at only 0.35 V potential. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system assembled with AuCuRh NWs requires only the electrolysis voltage of 0.38 V to achieve the co-production of NH3, formate, and hydrogen and ultra-stable continuous electrolysis for 300 hours. The NO2RR||FOR electrolysis system can be further decreased to only 0.29 V under illumination due to plasmon-enhanced activity. This study provides an energy-efficient coupling strategy for the stable co-production of value-added chemicals.</description>

                This research focused on successfully synthesizing CuWO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites using microwave assistance, and their potential as electrochemical supercapacitors and electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions was thoroughly investigated. Structural studies demonstrated the anchoring of the spherical CuWO4 nanoparticles with a triclinic structure on the g-C3N4 surface. The CuWO4/g-C3N4 system showed an impressive specific capacitance of 111 F g-1 and excellent stability (85%) in supercapacitor applications. It also exhibited remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, efficiently facilitating both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in distinct electrolytes. Notably, it achieved a standard current density of 10 mA cm-2 with significantly lower Tafel slopes (46 mV dec-1 (HER) and 104 mV dec-1 (OER)) compared to pristine CuWO4. The nanocomposite's superior electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of g-C3N4 and CuWO4, leading to high capacitance and excellent catalytic activity. Additionally, the nanocomposite exhibited enhanced nonlinear absorption and refraction upon He-Ne laser excitation, suggesting potential applications in optical devices. These findings highlight the promising prospects of CuWO4/g-C3N4 nanocomposites as multifunctional materials for energy storage and catalysis. DFT calculations further validate the experimental findings by providing insights into the electronic structures, quantum capacitance, adsorption geometries, and overpotentials of the hybrid systems. The calculated overpotential trend of CuW/gCN &lt; CuW agrees with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tuning axial ligand coordination for enhanced activity and selectivity in metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon single-atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction</title>

                Axial ligand coordination plays a critical role in modulating the catalytic activity and selectivity of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we systematically investigate FeN4, CoN4, and NiN4 active sites coordinated with a broad range of axial ligands to elucidate how ligand environments influence reaction energetics across different metal centers. Free energy analyses reveal that axial ligands can substantially modify key steps in the ORR pathway, including *OOH formation and *OH desorption, with distinct effects observed for each metal. FeN4 exhibits tunable activity and selectivity depending on the ligand, balancing between 4e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; pathways. CoN4 shows a pronounced preference toward the 2e&#8722; pathway under specific ligand environments, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production. In contrast, NiN4 displays generally high energy barriers and limited ORR activity across all axial ligands. These results establish a comparative framework for understanding how axial ligand coordination governs ORR performance and provide guidance for the rational design of M&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs with tailored activity and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Partitioning adsorption energy: An electronegativity-based descriptor for hydrogen adsorption on group IV and III&#8211;V 2D honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0295089</link>
      <description>Yi Sheng Ng, Jin&#8208;Cheng Zheng, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(14)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414969325

                Understanding and predicting hydrogen adsorption energy is key to designing effective electrocatalysts. In this study, we develop a physically interpretable descriptor within a framework that decomposes atomic hydrogen adsorption energy into intuitive contributions, applied to 22 group IV and III&#8211;V 2D honeycomb materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energy is decomposed into two components: bond energy, approximated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), and the energy cost of forming the additional bond, termed distortion energy Ed. This decomposition facilitates analysis of adsorption trends beyond treating adsorption energy as a single quantity. We find that ICOHP correlates strongly with the adsorption site electronegativity (R2 = 0.86), improving to R2 = 0.91 when electronegativity differences and structural parameters are included. Ed shows moderate correlation with the unrelaxed vacancy energy Evac (R2 = 0.60) and can be accurately modeled (R2 = 0.92) using similar dependences on electronegativity and structural parameters. Notably, Evac can be expressed in terms of the sum of electronegativities, enabling a DFT-free formulation. Combining both components into an Eads descriptor, we achieve an R2 score of 0.82 across both group IV and III&#8211;V systems. Further analysis reveals that increasing the adsorption site electronegativity weakens adsorption unless the lattice constant is sufficiently large. In addition, we identify a linear relationship between ICOHP and the zero-point energy change, allowing the descriptor to be extended to the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, a key indicator of hydrogen evolution reaction activity.</description>

      <title>Grand-Canonical Equivariant Neural Potentials for Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01381</link>
      <description>Jia-Lan Chen, Xin&#8208;Rui Qi, Jinze Zhu, Jin Li, Xuechun Jiang, Wei&#8208;Xue Li, Jin&#8208;Xun Liu, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414970226

                Electrochemical reactions under constant potential underpin critical processes in energy storage, catalysis, and corrosion but remain challenging to model owing to the voltage insensitivity of conventional machine learning potentials. The lack of a unified framework incorporating grand-canonical constraints into machine-learned models fundamentally limits accurate, scalable simulations of potential-dependent interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a constant-potential, E(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network (CPMPNN) that integrates grand-canonical electronic structure principles with a global excess-charge parameter that is dynamically redistributed via a multihead attention mechanism. The atomic geometry is encoded through a graph neural network that preserves the full symmetry of the Euclidean group in three dimensions (E(3))&#9472;including translations, rotations, and reflections. Benchmarking against the grand-canonical DFT confirms that the CPMPNN retains first-principles accuracy while achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude computational speedup. Applied to key electrocatalytic processes&#9472;CO dimerization in CO2 reduction and the Volmer step in hydrogen evolution on Cu(100)&#9472;CPMPNN captures how the applied potential modulates the reaction thermodynamics, charge distribution, and transition-state structures, providing mechanistic insight into potential-dependent kinetics. By bridging first-principle accuracy with molecular dynamics scalability, CPMPNN provides a transferable framework for operando modeling of electrified interfaces, enabling new mechanistic insights into potential-controlled electrocatalysis.</description>

                Ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) is a benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media but suffers from slow dissolution under operating conditions, limiting its long&#8208;term durability. Here, density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode model is employed to elucidate the atomistic mechanisms governing RuO 2 surface corrosion across a relevant potential window from 0 to 1.5 V standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) . The study reveals a potential&#8208;dependent switch in dissolution pathways: at anodic potentials above 1.21 V SHE , direct oxidative dissolution leads to soluble RuO 4 , whereas at lower potentials, coupled proton&#8211;electron transfer reactions drive the formation of soluble hydroxylated species, specifically Ru(OH) 4 and RuO 2 (OH) 2 . Key surface intermediates act as energetic basins, regulating transient dissolution during potential cycling and shutdown. Furthermore, it is shown that doping RuO 2 with W, Ti, or Ir shifts the onset potentials for these corrosion pathways, enhancing surface stability by widening the potential window where the materials are stable. These insights advance the mechanistic understanding of RuO 2 degradation and support rational strategies for designing durable OER catalysts in acidic water&#8208;splitting technologies.</description>

                In molecular studies, the accurate parametrization of small molecules stands as an essential yet growing demand. Addressing this, we introduce ParametrizANI, a tool crafted explicitly for establishing detailed protocols for dihedral parametrization using GAFF and OpenFF force fields. The robust PyTorch-based program, TorchANI, forms the backbone of ParametrizANI, functioning as a benchmark to uphold precision in parametrization tasks. TorchANI plays a pivotal role in enabling ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models, which are trained to predict potential energy surfaces and related molecular properties with high accuracy. Our work on ParametrizANI goes beyond just creating a tool; it is about building a research-friendly environment, free from the constraints of limited resources. We are committed to democratizing research, enabling teams of all sizes to perform dihedral parametrization with DFT-level accuracy. This tool opens up new possibilities in molecular dynamics and related fields. It marks a significant step forward in improving the scientific community's ability to parametrize small molecules. For a detailed look at its features, we invite you to check out ParametrizANI on GitHub (https://github.com/palermolab/ParametrizANI).</description>

      <description>Xuewen Xiao, A. Allouche, E. Dartois, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Magoul&#232;s, Daniel Pel&#225;ez, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414992617

                In this work, we introduce an automated methodology for the efficient and relatively inexpensive exploration of large high-dimensional chemical spaces, with particular focus on number-of-atoms-conserving processes, such as in mechanochemical reactions. Our approach combines: (1) a physically motivated stochastic global-landscape exploration phase (mechanochemical distortion), which efficiently overcomes entropic barriers, and (2) a local exploration phase in which the previously determined local basins are sampled with molecular dynamics and graph theory. Specifically, this last phase makes use of the (vdW-) transition state search using a chemical dynamical simulations algorithm. Our methodology requires minimal input from the user. As a case study, we have explored the conformational landscape, including transition states and minimum energy paths, of the C60H10 hydrogen-carbon clusters owing to their astrochemical relevance as potential carriers of the aromatic infrared bands. From a single initial seed (geometry), we have obtained a series of 212 mechanochemically relevant conformers, and from just 3 of them, we have obtained a set of &gt;13 000 minima spanning the domain of our interest. The underlying chemical network has been fully characterized and rationalized using statistical analysis tools. Our case study perfectly illustrates the potential of our approach in the automatic generation of chemical databases, in other words, annotated data for the training of data-hungry deep learning models in chemistry.</description>

      <title>Electron Donor Gd&#8208;Evoked Pd&#9472;OH* Interaction Modulation via Alloying for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202514759</link>

                Abstract Excessive adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) on palladium (Pd)&#8208;based materials is a critical factor limiting their catalytic activity. Alloying presents a powerful strategy to overcome this inherent challenge. In this study, the alloying of the low electronegativity lanthanide gadolinium (Gd) with Pd is explored. Pioneering theoretical calculations indicate that Gd, acting as an electron donor, induces charge redistribution between the metals. This process weakens the over&#8208;adsorption of OH* intermediates on the Pd surface and reduces the reaction overpotential. Subsequent experiments yield Pd 3 Gd solid&#8208;solution nano&#8208;alloys supported on conductive carbon black (Pd 3 Gd/C&#8208;600), resulting in a 30 mV enhancement in half&#8208;wave potential and a 4.5 fold increase in mass activity in an alkaline medium compared to Pd/C&#8208;600. Due to its superior performance in ORR, Zn&#8208;air batteries utilizing Pd 3 Gd/C&#8208;600 cathodes demonstrate remarkable peak power density and stability over 330 h. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of rare earth alloys and their catalytic chemistry in ORR.</description>

                DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA, affecting cellular function and disease development. Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, analyzes large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions. Over the past two decades, advances in bioinformatics technologies for arrays and sequencing have generated vast amounts of data, leading to the widespread adoption of machine learning methods for analyzing complex biological information for medical problems. This review explores recent advancements in DNA methylation studies that leverage emerging machine learning techniques for more precise, comprehensive, and rapid patient diagnostics based on DNA methylation markers. We present a general workflow for researchers, from clinical research questions to result interpretation and monitoring. Additionally, we showcase successful examples in diagnosing cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and multifactorial diseases. Some of these studies have led to the development of diagnostic platforms that have entered the global healthcare market, highlighting the promising future of this field.</description>

                Abstract Ni&#8211;N 4 &#8211;PAN&#8211;NC, consisting of an atomic Ni&#8211;N 4 site, mimics the intramolecular electron&#8208;harnessing of natural laccase (LAC) confined in a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (LAC@ZIF&#8208;8) for anodic electrooxidation of bisphenol&#8208;A (BPA). We have introduced a facile &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;resorcinol&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped conjugated &#8208;C&#8801;N. The atomically dispersed Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom in Ni&#8211;N 4 &#8208; PAN&#8211;NC exhibits high activity for the paired electrolysis of ORR and the electrooxidation of BPA with an enhanced current density. The single Ni&#8211;N 4&#8211; PAN&#8211;NC electrode effectively withdraws the electrons from electrooxidizing BPA due to a built&#8208;in electric field via incorporation of Ni&#8211;N 4 . The paired electrolysis of Ni&#8211;N 4&#8211; PAN&#8211;NC biofuel cells is determined by LSV, EIS, and power&#8208;polarization curve for anodic electrooxidation of BPA. Machine learning molecular dynamics (ML&#8208;MD) simulation depicts non&#8208;covalent interaction (hydrogen bonding) between the O&#8208;hydroxyl of BPA and the N of the Ni&#8211;N 4&#8211; PAN&#8211;NC, suggesting preferential adsorption on the Ni&#8211;N 4&#8211; PAN&#8211;NC surface via weak van der Waals interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the aromatic rings of BPA and the conjugated PAN&#8208;NC. An increased power density with increased concentration of BPA in the absence of ABTS suggests a DET mechanism of BPA electrooxidation on Ni&#8211;N 4 , unlike a MET in the presence of ABTS when using LAC@ZIF&#8208;8. Thus, single atomic Ni &#8722; N 4 opens avenues with a DET mechanism.</description>

                Abstract A central challenge in water electrolysis lies with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) where the formation of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) is hindered by the constraint of angular momentum conservation. While the reactants OH &#8722; or H 2 O are diamagnetic (DM), the O 2 product has a paramagnetic (PM) triplet ground state, requiring a change in spin configuration when being formed. This constraint has prompted interest in spin&#8208;selective catalysts as a means to facilitate OER. In this context, the roles of magnetism and chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in promoting the OER reaction have recently been investigated through both theoretical and experimental studies. However, pinpointing the key principles and their relative contribution in mediating spin&#8208;enhancement remains a significant challenge. This roadmap offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on current experimental trends and theoretical developments in spin&#8208;enhanced OER electrocatalysis and outlines strategic directions for integrating incisive experiments and operando approaches with computational modeling to disentangle key mechanisms. By providing a conceptual framework and identifying critical knowledge gaps, this perspective aims to guide researchers toward dedicated experimental and computational studies that will deepen the understanding of spin&#8208;induced OER enhancement and accelerate the development of next&#8208;generation catalysts.</description>

                Green transformation demands efficient protocols to convert renewable energy into usable forms. Microwave (MW)&#8211;driven catalytic systems offer a promising electrification strategy for chemical processes by enabling targeted, energy-efficient reactions. Unlike conventional heating, MW irradiation can localize energy at catalytic active sites. A major breakthrough is the selective MW heating of isolated metal ions or nanoparticles. This study presents a general catalyst design strategy to control MW-induced heating of single metal ions by tuning the zeolite framework and electrostatic interactions. Key structural and electronic factors governing atomic-scale energy localization are identified. Applying this approach to the reverse water-gas shift reaction results in energy efficiency improvements via targeted heating of single-ion sites. These findings mark a milestone in MW-assisted catalysis, establishing a framework for using MW energy in heterogeneous systems. The work introduces design principles for single-atom-antenna MW catalysts, advancing the development of next-generation catalytic reactors driven by electromagnetic energy.</description>

      <title>Total Galvanic Replacement Strategy for Synthesizing Hollow Multimetallic Nanocrystals Toward Enhanced Catalysis</title>

                Abstract The synergistic effects in multimetallic nanocrystals make them attractive catalysts, but constructing hollow architectures with controlled features poses substantial challenges. Here, the galvanic replacement reaction between Ag nanocubes and three metal precursors (Pd 2+ , Pt 2+ , and Au 3+ ) is used to demonstrate that both atomic mixing and atomic arrangements of the resulting AgPdPtAu hollow nanocrystals can be tuned through four distinct precursor addition strategies. This study reveals that increasing the mixing entropy induces a transition from phase&#8208;separated domains to a homogeneous solid solution. Moreover, preferential bonding between deposited and template metals promotes the formation of nanocubes enclosed by {100} facets with square atomic arrangements. When dispersed on semiconductor supports, these facet&#8208;controlled AgPdPtAu hollow nanocrystals exhibit enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Pt&#8208;containing bridge sites act as primary hydrogen adsorption centers, exhibiting high local electron density and strong hydrogen binding. Additionally, bridge sites formed by mixed&#8208;affinity metal pairs (e.g., AuPt and AgPd), coupling strongly (Pt or Pd), and weakly (Au or Ag) hydrogen&#8208;adsorbing elements, exhibit near&#8208;optimal hydrogen adsorption and serve as key active sites for hydrogen evolution. This study establishes a versatile approach for engineering multimetallic hollow nanocrystals with tunable structures for catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Isopropanol Electro-Oxidation on PtCu Alloys for Aqueous Organic Redox Chemistry Toward Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30194027</link>
      <description>Jinyao Tang, Xiaochen Shen, Laura Newsom, Rongxuan Xie, Parsa Pishva, Yanlin Zhu, Bin Liu, Zhenmeng Peng, Molecules. 30(19)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415040971

                Integration of renewable energy into modern power grids remains limited by intermittency and the need for reliable energy storage. Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage, yet their widespread adoption is hindered by the high cost. In this study, we investigate isopropanol as a redox-active species with Pt-Cu alloy electrocatalysts for aqueous-organic RFBs. A series of PtxCu catalysts with varying Pt:Cu ratios were synthesized and studied for isopropanol electro-oxidation reaction (IPAOR) performance. Among them, PtCu demonstrated the best performance, achieving a low activation energy of 14.4 kJ/mol at 0.45 V vs. RHE and excellent stability at 1 M isopropanol (IPA) concentration. Kinetic analysis and in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed significantly reduced acetone accumulation on PtCu compared to pure Pt, indicating enhanced resistance to catalyst poisoning. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further identified the first proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) as the rate-determining step (RDS) with C-H bond scission as the preferred pathway on PtCu. A proof-of-concept PtCu-catalyzed H-cell demonstrated stable cycling over 200 cycles, validating the feasibility of IPA as a low-cost, regenerable redox couple. These findings highlight PtCu-catalyzed IPA/acetone(ACE) chemistry as a promising platform for next-generation aqueous-organic RFBs.</description>

      <title>Active Center Inheritance: A Design Principle for Constructing Atomically Dispersed Bimetallic OER/ORR Catalysts Derived from Single-Atom Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5c04004</link>
      <description>Wenwen Li, Yiming Mo, Lingzhi Kang, Caixia Li, Jingnan Zheng, Chenglong Qiu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415068230

                Atomically dispersed bimetallic catalysts (ADCs), an emerging class of electrocatalysts, combine the synergistic advantages of dual-metal active sites with the atomic dispersion and high metal utilization efficiency characteristic of single-atom catalysts (SACs). Their unique structural features offer the potential to exceed the catalytic performance of conventional systems but simultaneously pose challenges due to the absence of well-established rational design principles. This paper proposes and validates a structural design strategy, "Active Center Inheritance," wherein high-performance SACs are transformed into ADCs by retaining the same active center (M&#8211;Nx). This approach not only preserves high catalytic activity but also significantly reduces the computational cost associated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations over 13,500 candidate systems, thereby accelerating the discovery of bifunctional electrocatalysts. A total of 17 high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts were identified through this strategy. This strategy was successfully generalized to three other ADC structural systems with different spatial arrangements. Moreover, a unified descriptor (&#966;), composed of four key electronic and atomic features, was constructed to effectively correlate the adsorption behaviors of critical reaction intermediates (*OH, *O, and *OOH) across diverse systems. The results reveal that SACs and ADCs can achieve comparable catalytic activity when constructed with the same M&#8211;Nx active center, thereby enabling the synergistic optimization of active sites. This work provides a theoretical basis and a rational design framework for the development of efficient multisite electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Bridging Text Mining and Quantum Simulations for the Design of 2D Monochalcogenide Materials</title>

                The formulation of a structured framework dedicated to the systematic review of the literature, identification of potential compounds, theoretical quantum chemistry characterization, and assessment of the significance of stability descriptors is essential for accelerating the discovery of two-dimensional materials for technological applications. In this work, we selected the two-dimensional monochalcogenides (MQ), which have attracted increased interest due to their potential applications in future devices, as prototype materials for the present investigation. Our framework started with a natural language processing analysis of more than 5400 articles, revealing a growing research interest in the two-dimensional MQ compounds, especially in electronics, energy, and fundamental studies. This led to the selection of 27 diverse MQ compounds across 13 distinct two-dimensional structural phases for density functional theory calculations, resulting in an extensive database of physicochemical properties. We evaluated formation enthalpies, uncovering clear stability trends (e.g., stability declines with heavier chalcogens, dynamic robustness of GeSe), and evaluated equilibrium lattice parameters, noting predictable expansions and significant anisotropies. Bader charge analysis offered insights into charge-transfer and ionicity trends. Our electronic structure analysis identified band gaps (direct or indirect, depending on the M element group and the weight of the chalcogen) and optical absorption anisotropies significantly influenced by crystal symmetry and spin orbit coupling. Importantly, band alignment calculations classified all possible heterojunctions as type I, II, or III, underscoring their extensive potential for future optoelectronic device development. Additionally, we incorporated machine learning, using a random forest approach, along with our density functional theory calculations to accurately forecast trends in energetic properties. This analysis identified the electronic charge as a highly significant stability descriptor among the 34 descriptors, underscoring its importance for future machine learning endeavors. Hence, this study offers a streamlined framework for the characterization and discovery of promising two-dimensional materials, highlighting the synergy between data-driven analysis and quantum-based simulations.</description>

                Over the past two decades, the integration of machine learning (ML) into theoretical and computational chemistry has transformed the scale and scope of discovery that is possible on a computer. In this Perspective, I share my personal journey from early density functional theory method development for small transition metal complexes to the building of automated workflows and ML models for catalysis, redox chemistry, and materials design. I will describe my unlikely path toward machine learning starting from minimal models of catalysts and the use of structural databases to gain data-driven insights. I will then describe our experiences in training machine learning models for discovery, including active learning and descriptor-based approaches that enabled data-driven exploration despite limited experimental reference data for open-shell transition metal complexes. As an example of overcoming these limitations, I will describe our more recent efforts that culminated in experimental validation of our computational predictions. Along the way, challenges in data curation, DFT method sensitivity, and synthetic realism have shaped the trajectory of the field. I conclude with reflections on the rapid rise of generative AI, agentic workflows, and the enduring need to ask questions that truly advance molecular discovery.</description>

      <title>Robust catalyst assessment for the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-025-01691-z</link>
      <description>Devesh K. Pathak, Rajkumar Jana, Ruth Bello, Kelsey White, Kelsey A. Stoerzinger, Communications Chemistry. 8(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415021585

                The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) can enable distributed conversion of waste to ammonia. Unlike the electrocatalytic dinitrogen reduction reaction, measurements of NO3RR often consider a fixed quantity of the nitrate anion in a batch system, presenting unique concerns for measurements of catalytic activity and selectivity. In addition, the sensitivity of kinetics and transport to electrolyte composition&#8212;where a diverse range of waste feedstocks are of interest&#8212;can have a notable impact on catalyst performance, hindering catalyst comparison. We highlight reaction complexities and advocate best practices for robust measurement of catalyst activity, selectivity, and Faradaic efficiency in this burgeoning field. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is widely studied, but under a range of conditions, with implications on catalyst performance. Here, the authors highlight potential pitfalls in comparing across (and within) existing literature and suggest approaches to assess electrocatalysts under common conditions.</description>

      <title>Defect compensation as a strategic approach to enhance photocatalytic water splitting performance of SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                Abstract Determining suitable dopants with optimized doping concentration is critical to design efficient water splitting photocatalysts. However, there is currently a lack of fundamental knowledge to guide this process. Herein, we examine the impact of Al 3+ , Mg 2+ , and Ga 3+ on the photocatalytic performance of SrTiO 3 and propose a defect compensation model to understand the doping effect. Doped SrTiO 3 crystals were grown hydrothermally and treated in molten SrCl 2 . The hydrogen production rates from 50 catalysts produced in this way were measured with a high&#8208;throughput parallelized and automated photochemical reactor (PAPCR). The investigation revealed that all three dopants significantly enhance the photocatalytic reactivity. According to Brouwer diagrams computed using available reaction constants, the optimum reactivity is achieved when the concentration of acceptor dopants fully compensates the oxygen vacancy donors. The improved reactivity can be attributed to the reduction in free electron concentration, resulting in a space charge layer that is 1000 times longer. Consequently, this situation enhances the number of photogenerated charge carriers capable of being separated by the band bending and transported to the surface.</description>

      <title>Graph neural networks for predicting metal&#8211;ligand coordination of transition metal complexes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415658122</link>
      <description>Jacob Toney, R. Michel, Aaron Garrison, Ilia Kevlishvili, Heather J. Kulik, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 122(41)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414857994

                High-throughput virtual screening campaigns are invaluable for surveying the combinatorial space of possible transition metal complexes (TMCs), but they rely on accurate metal&#8211;ligand connectivity for meaningful results. Here, we curate a dataset of 70,069 unique ligands of known coordination from experimental structures of TMCs deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using this dataset, we train separate graph neural network models to predict the total number and individual identities of ligand coordinating atoms with high accuracy and precision. Interpreting each model in terms of the learned molecular representations uncovers trends aligned with our understanding of coordination chemistry as well as chemical insights. Next, we integrate the trained models with the high-throughput screening software molSimplify and illustrate their utility by generating 1,175 TMCs and validating their geometries with density functional theory calculations. We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.</description>
