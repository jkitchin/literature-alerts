                Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the key step for energy conversion in electrocatalysis. Atomic-scale simulation acts as an indispensable tool to provide a microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the quantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical constant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical electrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to explicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient grand canonical sampling, further assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical conditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET simulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a physical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring protons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET paths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to classical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of NQEs may reshape our fundamental understanding of other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios of energy conversion processes.</description>

                FeM (M = Se, Te) chalcogenides have been well studied as promising magnets and superconductors, yet their potential as electrocatalysts is often considered limited due to anion dissolution and oxidation during electrochemical reactions. Here, we show that by using two-dimensional (2D) FeTeSe nanosheets, these conventionally perceived limitations can be leveraged to enable the reaction-driven in-situ generation of anisotropic in-plane tensile and out-of-plane compressive strains during the alkaline low-concentration nitrate reduction reaction (NO3-RR). The reconstructed catalyst demonstrates enhanced performance, yielding ammonia with a near-unity Faradaic efficiency and a high yield rate of 42.14 &#177; 2.06 mg h-1 mgcat-1. A series of operando synchrotron-based X-ray measurements and ex-situ characterizations, alongside theoretical calculations, reveal that strain formation is ascribed to chalcogen vacancies created by partial Se/Te leaching, which facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of OH-/NO3- from the electrolyte, resulting in an O(H)-doped strained lattice. Combined electrochemical and computational investigations suggest that the superior catalytic performance arises from the synergistic contributions from the exposed strained Fe sites and surface hydroxyl groups. These findings highlight the potential of 2D transition metal chalcogenides for in-situ structural engineering during electrochemical reactions to enhance catalytic activity for NO3-RR and beyond.</description>

      <title>A charge calibration strategy for describing the charge transfer during the electrochemical elementary step</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0240019</link>
      <description>X. C. Lv, Sheng&#8722;Jie Qian, Hao Cao, Yang&#8208;Gang Wang, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(15)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409456230

                Constant potential modeling of electrocatalytic processes remains a significant challenge in the field of computational catalysis, primarily due to the difficulty in simultaneously considering the influence of constant potential conditions, explicit solvent environment, and the double-layer structure. In this work, we propose a charge calibration strategy for electrocatalytic processes. This strategy accounts for charge transfer in systems with explicit solvation and ions during constant-potential free energy modeling. In our strategy, interfacial counter-ions are employed to model the Helmholtz layer and determine the surface charge density, which defines the electrode potential. During the simulation of electrochemical reactions, extra charges are introduced/extracted to/from the system to compensate for electron transfer between the electrode and the reaction species and keep a constant surface charge density along the reaction profile. Our method showcases the impact of potential-dependent solvent reorganization on reaction kinetics and underscores the importance of constant potential kinetics. We anticipate that the strategy presented here will inspire further theoretical and experimental studies for electrochemistry interfaces.</description>

                The d orbital physics are closely related to the catalytic activity of transition-metal-based catalysts in Li-S batteries. However, challenges remain in understanding the optimal electronic configuration, causing a lack of guidance in the precise design of catalysts. Herein, by virtue of LaCoO3-based catalysts with different combinations of low-spin states and high-spin states of Co3+, a volcano relationship between dz2 filling number (from 0.95 to 1.29) and S/Li2S redox reaction kinetics is revealed. The best kinetics are provided at the dz2 filling number of 1.12. As a result, the assembled Li-S battery shows a low decay rate of 0.026% per cycle in a 1500-cycle test and a high energy density of 460.7 Wh kg-1 in a practical pouch cell. This work reveals the critical influences of dz2 electronic states on catalyzing the S/Li2S redox reaction and provides insights into finely regulating the electronic structures of high-performance catalysts for practical Li-S batteries.</description>

      <title>Modeling electronic absorption spectra with nuclear quantum effects in constrained nuclear&#8211;electronic orbital framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0254111</link>
      <description>Xi Xu, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(15)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409457827

                Electronic absorption spectra serve as versatile and powerful tools in experiments. Accurate theoretical simulation of electronic absorption spectra is challenging because multiple factors such as environmental effects and nuclear quantum effects contribute to spectrum lineshapes. This work proposes a protocol to model electronic absorption spectra in the constrained nuclear&#8211;electronic orbital framework. Solvent effects, temperature effects, and particularly nuclear quantum effects can be taken into consideration in this unified framework. This protocol is applied to investigate the electronic absorption spectrum of the pyridine molecule in water. Nuclear quantum effects are found to induce a broadening and red shift of the absorption spectrum of pyridine.</description>

                Abstract The rising demand for sustainable green hydrogen production necessitates efficient and cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts. Inspired by the catalytic activities of columbite&#8208;tantalite, this study combines a scalable cutting&#8208;edge synthesis approach with atomic&#8208;level structures and metal&#8208;center&#8208;mediated mechanisms to unravel its operational performance and stability. Using ad in situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure combined with Density Functional Theory (DFT), the results reveal distinctive valence band peaks and moderate charge transfer from Mn and Fe sites, enabling stable adsorption and reduced activation barriers. In contrast, the high&#8208;valence Nb and Ta centers at the B&#8208;sites promote favorable d &#8208;band alignment, enhancing orbital overlap with oxygen p&#8208; orbitals. This facilites electronic delocalization, lowers charge accumulation, and reduces activation barriers of intermediates species. Fe and Mn at the A&#8208;sites exhibit strong redox reactivity and optimal adsorption for OH* and O*, supporting efficient electron fransfers. Solvation effects modeled via VASPsol further stabilize key intermediates, especially O*, reducing the energy barrier for water dissociation. Notably, FeMn(NbTa) 2 O 6 &#8208;columbite catalysts stand out with a cell voltage of 1.81 V at a current density of 700 mA cm &#8722;2 , compared to 40% Pt/C&#8208;RuO&#8322; (1.75 V) at the same current density in the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Also, the FeMn(NbTa) 2 O 6 &#8208;columbite exhibits long&#8208;term stability at 800 mA cm &#8722;2 , surpassing the benchmark 40% Pt Vulcan&#8208;RuO 2 after 200 h in AEMWE. This work significantly advances current research and establishes a design rule for selecting metal compositions in the development of advanced electrocatalysts in alkaline water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Mild-Condition Conversion of Methane to Acetic Acid over MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Confined Rh&#8211;Fe Sites</title>

                The oriented conversion of CH4 to CH3COOH at low temperature, even room temperature, is both scientifically significant and industrially applicable for CH4 utilization, yet it is extremely challenging due to the difficulties associated with efficient CH4 activation and controllable C-C coupling. In this study, we for the first time achieve the room-temperature conversion of CH4 to CH3COOH using molecular O2 and CO over MoS2-confined Rh-Fe sites, which delivers an unprecedented CH3COOH selectivity of 90.3% and a productivity of 26.2 &#956;mol gcat.-1 h-1 at 25 &#176;C. Furthermore, the productivity of CH3COOH can be enhanced to 105.6 &#956;mol gcat.-1 h-1 at 80 &#176;C, while maintaining a high selectivity of 95.6%. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation reveal the critical role of Rh-Fe synergy in the selective formation of CH3COOH. The confined Fe sites in MoS2 enable the activation of O2 to generate highly reactive Fe&#9552;O center for CH4 dissociation to CH3 species at room temperature, which then readily couple with adsorbed CO on adjacent Rh sites to form the key CH3CO intermediate for CH3COOH production. The unique structure of Rh-Fe sites offers synergistic catalytic properties that effectively balance C-H activation and C-C coupling, successfully addressing the trade-off between activity and selectivity in the carbonylation of CH4 to CH3COOH under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenation-Facilitated Spontaneous N-O Cleavage Mechanism for Effectively Boosting Nitrate Reduction Reaction on Fe2B2 MBene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30081778</link>
      <description>Yuexuan He, Zhiwen Chen, Qing Jiang, Molecules. 30(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409480531

                The electrochemical reduction of toxic nitrate wastewater to green fuel ammonia under mild conditions has become a goal that researchers have relentlessly pursued. Existing designed electrocatalysts can effectively promote the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), but the study of the catalytic mechanism is not extensive enough, resulting in no breakthroughs in performance. In this study, a novel mechanism of hydrogenation-facilitated spontaneous N-O cleavage was explored based on density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the Ead&#8722;*OH (adsorption energy of the adsorbed *OH) was used as a key descriptor for predicting the occurrence of spontaneous N-O bond cleavage. We found that Ead&#8722;*OH &lt; &#8722;0.20 eV results into spontaneous N-O bond cleavage. However, excessively strong adsorption of OH* hinders the formation of water. To address this challenge, we designed the eligible Fe2B2 MBene, which shows excellent catalytic activity with an ultra-low limiting potential for NO3RR of &#8722;0.22 V under this novel reaction mechanism. Additionally, electron-deficient Fe active sites could inhibit competing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), which provides high selectivity. This work may offer valuable insights for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.</description>

                Even highly planar, polished metal surfaces display varying levels of roughness that can affect their optical and electronic properties, impacting performance in state-of-the-art microelectronics. Current methods for smoothing rough metallic surfaces require either the removal or addition of substantial amounts of material using complex processes that are incompatible with 3-dimensional nanoscale features needed for state-of-the-art applications. We present a vapor-phase process that results in up to a 60% smoothing of nanometer-scale rough gold surfaces through a single exposure to a class of ligands called N-heterocyclic carbenes. This process does not require removal or addition of metal from the surface and provides smoothing at the &#197;ngstr&#246;m scale. Smoothing occurs in a single deposition, giving quantifiable differences in the adsorption behavior of the resulting surfaces. The process takes place through an adatom-extraction-driven destabilization and restructuring of the surface in a self-limiting manner. This process is achieved without the use of harsh chemical etchants or mechanical intervention, takes only minutes, and can easily be integrated with vapor-phase processing in situ in microfabrication workflows. Our observations demonstrate atomic layer restructuring, a technique that compliments atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching in the fabrication and processing of high-precision materials.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Mechanism and Intermediates of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract The Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) plays a crucial role in corrosion mechanisms and the operation of electrochemical energy devices, affecting both stability and efficiency. Despite extensive research, the exact mechanisms and intermediates involved in ORR continue to be subjects of study. The literature reports a range of intermediates and mechanisms, which can be complex and, at times, contradictory. This paper conducts a comprehensive literature review with a primary focus on ORR mechanisms on steel, while also examining platinum, gold, and carbon electrodes. Recent advancements in experimental techniques and theoretical modeling have improved our understanding of ORR, which is essential for corrosion science and energy conversion technologies. This review compiles and analyzes the existing literature on the ORR, focusing on its behavior across different electrodes, including platinum, gold and steel/iron. The study identifies key intermediates such as HO2-, O2-, H2O2, OOH, and OH through electrochemical measurements and in situ spectroscopic methods, mapping their formation and consumption. Understanding these ORR pathways and their interactions with other corrosion processes contributes to the refinement of predictive corrosion models.</description>

      <title>Ten&#8208;Electron Count Rule of MXene&#8208;Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Sulfur Reduction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cnl2.70011</link>

                ABSTRACT Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are proposed as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity and specific energy. However, the actual capacity utilization is greatly limited by the poor reactivity of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR), which motivates us to develop corresponding high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Inspired by the application of MXene and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in improving SRR, a virtual screening on the MXene&#8208;supported SACs from the imp2d database is carried out. Finally, six kinds of top catalysts are identified for SRR, and most of them can be considered as variants of the previous representative SRR catalysts, which reflects the rationality of our screening. Meanwhile, the stability and reactivity metrics of the SACs are calculated by density functional theory (DFT) and show obvious trends depending on the type of adatom/MXene. For the critical intermediate binding that can tune SRR activity, further electronic structure analysis reveals the so&#8208;called 10&#8208;electron count rule, whose decisive role is also reflected by the Shapley value analysis from machine learning (ML). It is noteworthy that this count rule was used to analyze the SACs for hydrogen/carbon/nitrogen&#8208;related reactions before, and our successful attempt to optimize SRR further indicates its universality in catalysis fields. Overall, the 10&#8208;electron count rule not only rationalizes the nature of SAC&#8211;adsorbate interactions but also provides intuitive design guidance for novel SRR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Recent Strategies for Ni3S2-Based Electrocatalysts with Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Performance: A Tutorial Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms26083771</link>
      <description>Yucheng Shen, Jixing Bai, Huijie Wei, Jun Gu, Qi Cao, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 26(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409503461

                Water electrolysis represents one of the most environmentally friendly methods for hydrogen production, while its overall efficiency is primarily governed by the electrocatalyst. Nickel sulfides, e.g., Ni3S2, are considered to be highly promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their distinctive chemical structure. However, the practical application of Ni3S2-based electrocatalysts is hindered by unsatisfactory high overpotential in the HER and weakened catalytic performance under alkaline conditions. Therefore, in this regard, further research on Ni3S2-based catalysts is being carried out to tackle these challenges. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in Ni3S2-based in improving the HER performance of Ni3S2-based electrocatalysts. The review may offer some inspiration for the rational design and synthesis of novel transition metal-based catalysts with enhanced water electrolysis performance.</description>

                Abstract Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523 V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm &#8722;1 ) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kg cell &#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm &#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C is achieved.</description>

                Abstract The construction of control groups of scientists is often a daunting effort. This paper presents , an open-source Python-based software designed to efficiently query the Scopus database via RESTful API. searches for researchers with publication profiles similar to a given researcher up to a given year based on all main standard bibliometric indicators. The user can choose flexibly a set of parameters to restrict the search to more or less narrow boundaries upfront and obtain additional similarity indicators to select a subset of authors after the search. Advanced settings also allow narrowing the search to a list of affiliations and to minimize the possible errors arising from ambiguous author profiles. One basic search can be set up in a few command lines and the average time of computation goes between 60 and 300 minutes. We discuss the functioning, characteristics, limitations and possible extension of the software.</description>

      <title>Strategic Surface Engineering of Lithium Metal Anodes: Simultaneous Native Layer Elimination and Protective Layer Formation &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Gas&#8211;Solid Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c03708</link>
      <description>Siwon Choi, Seongwook Chae, Taemin Kim, Hyeonsol Shin, Jin-Gyu Bae, Seung Geol Lee, Ji Hoon Lee, Hyeon Jeong Lee, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409529449

                Lithium (Li) metal has received significant attention as an anode material for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, the high reactivity of Li metal leads to the formation of a native layer on its surface, inducing nonuniform Li+ flux at the electrolyte/Li metal interface, which promotes the growth of Li metal dendrites. In this study, perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES) was vaporized to chemically react with the native layer and modify the Li metal surface. This gas-solid reaction removes the native layer while simultaneously forming a homogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. The Si-O-Si network formed through condensation reactions between PFOTES molecules, combined with the fluorinated carbon chain of PFOTES, facilitates rapid Li+ kinetics at the Li metal/electrolyte interface. Consequently, the exchange current density of PFOTES-modified Li (PFOTES-Li) increased to 0.2419 mA cm-2, which is 20 times higher than that of Bare-Li (0.0119 mA cm-2). The SEI layer derived from PFOTES effectively mitigates Li pulverization and the formation of dead Li during the long-term cycling. As a result, the PFOTES-Li||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 203.4 mAh g-1 under a high areal loading of 4.2 mAh cm-2. This study demonstrates a gas-solid reaction strategy for removing the native layer from the Li metal surface while forming a stable SEI layer, thereby ensuring high Li+ conductivity and mechanical stability, thus improving the cycling stability of Li metal batteries.</description>

      <title>Design of Twisted Two-Dimensional Heterostructures and Performance Regulation Descriptor for Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Nitric Oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c02696</link>
      <description>Xingxing Wen, Oleg V. Prezhdo, Lai Xu, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409538585

                The electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) represents an attractive alternative for valorizing waste NO streams (NORR). However, discovering efficient catalysts for NO-to-NH3 conversion remains challenging. We have designed metal-intercalated twisted graphene-BN heterostructures, in which metal atoms act as electron-transfer bridges. The twisted configuration facilitates cross-interface charge transfer, redistributing electrons from the graphene-metal interface to the metal-BN interface and BN surface. This electronic modulation enables boron atom adjacent to the metal center in BN to serve as active sites, promoting strong chemisorption and enhanced activation of NO. After high-throughput screening of the stability and NO capture ability of various transition metal-intercalated twisted heterostructures, we have investigated systematically the NORR pathways across 30 candidates. The results show that the rBN-Ti-G&#952; and rBN-V-G&#952; heterostructures exhibit exceptional NO-to-NH3 catalytic performance under optimized twisting conditions. Additionally, using sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) for model training, we propose a descriptor and establish a relationship between the twist angle and catalytic activity. This study bridges the gap in applying twisted heterostructures to NORR electrocatalysis and provides new insights and strategies for designing high-performance NORR catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Cu&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reactions facilitate the transformation of CO 2 into economically viable multicarbon products. There remains a pressing need to design efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective catalysts to enhance the selectivity for these multicarbon products. Metal&#8208;oxide heterogeneous interface can modify the electronic structure of metal surfaces, influencing the adsorption energy of crucial intermediates and thereby enhancing the selectivity for multicarbon products. In this study, Cu/ZnO electrodes are prepared by magnetron sputtering to achieve a Faraday efficiency of 51.2% for C 2 H 4 at &#8722;1.17 V. The Cu/ZnO heterogeneous interface provided abundant active sites for the reaction, and the lower work function facilitated the multi&#8208;electron transfer process necessary for the reduction of CO 2 to C 2 H 4 , thereby enhances the catalytic performance. DFT calculations reveal that the upward shift in the d&#8208;band center of Cu/ZnO, compared to pure Cu, enhances the adsorption energy of the crucial intermediate * CO. Moreover, the C&#8208;C coupling achieved on Cu/ZnO through the * CHO&#8208; * CHO pathway, which features lower energy barriers, ensures high selectivity in the conversion of CO 2 to C 2 H 4 . This work provides a promising and effective strategy for the large&#8208;scale development of metal&#8208;oxide catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to C 2 H 4 .</description>

                Abstract Natural biomass-derived carbon material is one promising alternative to traditional graphene-based catalyst for oxygen electrocatalysis. However, their electrocatalytic performance were constrained by the limited modulating strategy. Herein, using N-doped commercial coconut shell-derived activated carbon (AC) as catalyst model, the controllably enhanced sp 2 -C domains, through an flash Joule heating process, effectively improve the edge defect density and overall graphitization degree of AC catalyst, which tunes the electronic structure of N configurations and accelerates electron transfer, leading to excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance (half-wave potential of 0.884 V RHE , equivalent to commercial 20% Pt/C, with a higher kinetic current density of 5.88 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and oxygen evolution reaction activity (overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA cm 2 ). In a Zn-air battery, the catalyst shows outstanding cycle stability (over 1200 h) and a peak power density of 121 mW cm &#8722;2 , surpassing commercial Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the enhanced catalytic activity arises from the axial regulation of local sp 2 -C domains. This work establishes a robust strategy for sp 2 -C domain modulation, offering broad applicability in natural biomass-based carbon catalysts for electrocatalysis.</description>

                We conducted an upgrade prediction for NRR electrocatalysts on g-C 16 N 5 featuring the local coordinationof TM&#8211;N 4 , with Mo@g-C 16 N 5 standing out. Using the constant-potential method and an implicit solvent model, we find the electric double-layer capacitance is key in modulating the kinetic barrier.</description>

                In recent years, the TMN4 moieties have demonstrated significant catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in graphene, CxNy, and other carbon-based two-dimensional (2D) support materials. Modifying the coordination number and species of N atoms in the TMN4 moieties has proven to be an effective approach to regulate their catalytic activity. In this research, by incorporating different triphenylene ligands, we have successfully constructed TMA2B2 (TM = Co, Rh, Ir; A/B = N, O, S, Se) moieties with varying coordination environments within 2D metal organic frameworks (MOFs), which are linked by TM and triphenylene. These moieties serve as an effective model to elucidate the structure-property relationship of two-dimensional 2D-MOFs in OER and ORR. Our findings confirm that alterations in the coordination environment can finely tune the d-band electron distribution of the TM within the TMA2B2 unit, particularly activating the dyz and dz2 orbitals of O2, thereby influencing the interactions between TM and key intermediates. We discovered that the regulatory effect of the coordination environment is closely linked to the electronegativity of the coordinating atoms, which led us to establish reliable descriptors such as &#966;1 and &#966;2 to elucidate the impact of coordination environments on the performance of OER/ORR. This criterion can be applied to numerous other 2D-MOFs and provides an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship facilitates the development of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR applications.</description>

      <title>A Pulsed Tandem Electrocatalysis Strategy for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                Electroreduction of CO2 to value-added C2 products remains hindered by sluggish C-C coupling kinetics and competing side reactions. Inspired by the tandem catalytic mechanisms of multienzyme systems, we designed a dual-site single-atom nanozyme (DSAN) comprising FeN4 and FeO4 sites (FeN4-FeO4). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations under constant potential reveal that the FeN4 site functions as a CO generator, while the FeO4 site facilitates CO migration, C-C coupling, and subsequent C2 product formation. To further optimize the catalytic efficiency, we introduced a pulsed electrocatalysis strategy by alternating between zero potential and -0.7 V. This approach dynamically modulates active-site functions: at -0.70 V, CO2 adsorption and *CH3CH2OH formation are facilitated, while at 0 V, CO migration and C-C coupling are enhanced due to the spin-state transitions during potential switching. Additionally, the zero potential suppresses excessive hydrogenation of key intermediates, thereby improving CH3CH2OH selectivity. These findings highlight the synergistic strategy integrating tandem catalysis and pulsed potential control, offering a novel and effective approach for CO2-to-C2 conversion using SAN catalysts.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study on the CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) Performance of h-BN-Based Single-Atom Catalysts Modified with Transition Metals</title>

                The reasonable design of low-cost, high-activity single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial for achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2RR. In this study, we systematically explore, using density functional theory (DFT), the performance of transition metal (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn)-doped defect-type hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) SACs TM@B&#8722;1N (B vacancy) and TM@BN&#8722;1 (N vacancy) in both CO2RR and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (ICOHP) analysis reveals that these catalysts weaken the sp orbital hybridization of CO2, which promotes the formation of radical-state intermediates and significantly reduces the energy barrier for the hydrogenation reaction. Therefore, these theoretical calculations indicate that the Mn, Fe, Co@B&#8722;1N, and Co@BN&#8722;1 systems demonstrate excellent CO2 chemical adsorption properties. In the CO2RR pathway, Mn@B&#8722;1N exhibits the lowest limiting potential (UL = &#8722;0.524 V), and its higher d-band center (&#8722;0.334 eV), which aligns optimally with the adsorbate orbitals, highlights its excellent catalytic activity. Notably, Co@BN&#8722;1 exhibits the highest activity in HER, while UL is &#8722;0.217 V. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that Mn@B&#8722;1N shows 16.4 times higher selectivity for CO2RR than for HER. This study provides a theoretical framework for designing bifunctional SACs with selective reaction pathways. Mn@B&#8722;1N shows considerable potential for selective CO2 conversion, while Co@BN&#8722;1 demonstrates promising prospects for efficient hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Visualization of the Key Proton Activities in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Electrochromic Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202500631</link>
      <description>Yaping Jiang, Jun Hu, Hang Cai, Hongxiang Zeng, Hongyu Wang, Jiangbei Wan, Zhen Wang, Zhigang Chen, Zhigang Zhao, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409620546

                Abstract The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising route to produce sustainable hydrogen energy carrier for global carbon neutrality. The HER performance is largely determined by the overall proton activities, but the identification of such key proton activities in microscopic HER process is rather difficult. Herein, the study demonstrates a visualized HER concept by integrating the fundamental HER process with electrochromic technology on a well&#8208;designed Pt@WO 3 platform in acidic electrolyte, where the overall proton activities in HER process can be rapidly discriminated by the color changes of Pt@WO 3 electrochromic electrode. In contrast to bare WO 3 counterpart, the Pt@WO 3 electrochromic electrode displays a rather more positive potential of initial&#8208;coloration state and faster decoloration rate associated with significantly improved reaction kinetics of hydrogen intercalation and deintercalation within WO 3 component. Correspondingly, the as&#8208;prepared Pt@WO 3 catalyst electrode exhibits a remarkable HER activity with a lower onset&#8208;potential (45 mV, proton adsorption and accumulation) and smaller Tafel slope (50 mV dec &#8722;1 , proton desorption), nearly 11.1&#8208; and 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement than those of bare WO 3 counterpart. It is believed that the work in integrating the interesting visualization functionality into fundamental HER process may improve the readability of such microscopic electrocatalytic reaction and advance the exploration of more intelligent electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Thymoquinone (TQ), a compound with diverse pharmacological benefits, faces limited availability from natural sources. In this study, the design of a highly efficient electrocatalyst, Pt clusters loaded on CeO 2 with rich oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;Pt/CeO 2 ), for the electrocatalytic oxidation of thymol (TY) or carvacrol to produce TQ is reported. The introduction of oxygen vacancies to the surface of Vo&#8208;Pt/CeO 2 significantly reduces the adsorption energy of TQ, facilitating its desorption and preventing product accumulation and catalyst poisoning. As a result, Vo&#8208;Pt/CeO 2 demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance, achieving &#8776;100% selectivity and up to 98% yield of TQ under 1.2 V RHE . In situ, Raman spectroscopy indicates that the electrocatalytic oxidation mechanism of TY involves water attacking the TY intermediate to form thymohydroquinone, which is subsequently oxidized to TQ. Overall, this work provides novel insights into the catalyst design and presents a new strategy for sustainable TQ synthesis.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Approaches to Corrosion Resistant Alloy Development</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5006/c2023-19410</link>
      <description>Christopher D Taylor, conference. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4409501561

                Abstract Given that the foundation of aqueous corrosion of alloys is rooted in electrochemistry, the search for new alloy formulations should be derived from the fundamental electrochemical properties of the elements and their compounds. Properties of relevance include the standard reduction potential of the elements, the electronic work function, the newly re-discovered property of the ionic work function, as well as additional properties such as the cohesive energy, the oxide formation potential, and the ability to catalyze the important cathodic reactions such as oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen reduction reaction. Following trends in &#8220;materials informatics&#8221; an approach has been developed to create work flows for exploring new element combinations that can be optimized for one or more of these features. We demonstrate in this work how the approach may be followed to suggest new alloys with superior resistance to localized corrosion, and how it may be expanded to include microstructural characteristics as well as to provide a basis for more quantitative predictions of corrosion rates in a given environmental condition.</description>
