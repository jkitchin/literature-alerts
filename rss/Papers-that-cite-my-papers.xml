      <title>Unraveling the Defluorination Mechanism of Sodium Fluoro-Aluminates on Graphite: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.5c00956</link>

                The graphitized carbon blocks are used as cathode and anode materials on modern aluminum electrolyzers, which provide a reaction interface between molten salts and a graphitized cathode for the electrochemical reaction. The first-principle calculations were performed to clarify the defluorination mechanism of fluoro-aluminates on graphite cathodes in aluminum electrolysis for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction. The adsorption behaviors of intermediates involved in defluorination reactions on graphite surfaces are analyzed, revealing their spontaneous adsorption based on their adsorption energies and charge density differences. Furthermore, the defluorination pathways of both single Na3AlF6 clusters and fluoride-aluminate polymers are elucidated. Notably, Na3AlF6, after undergoing the thermochemical defluorination process to obtain AlF3, preferentially undergoes electrochemical defluorination via Al-F-Al polymerization. The key findings indicate that the chemical defluorination of Na3AlF6 leading to NaAlF4 serves as a pivotal step, facilitating the overall defluorination process and enhancing the aluminum production efficiency. This work provides fundamental insights into optimizing aluminum electrolysis processes.</description>

      <title>Protons Accumulate at the Graphene&#8211;Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c02053</link>
      <description>Xavier R. Advincula, Kara D. Fong, Angelos Michaelides, Christoph Schran, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409871406

                Water's ability to autoionize into hydroxide and hydronium ions profoundly influences surface properties, rendering interfaces either basic or acidic. While it is well-established that protons show an affinity to the air-water interface, a critical knowledge gap exists in technologically relevant surfaces like the graphene-water interface. Here we use machine learning-based simulations with first-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of hydroxide and hydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that protons accumulate at the graphene-water interface, with the hydronium ion predominantly residing in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion exhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and further away from it. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals local polarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement. Proton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation of surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for ion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Dissolution: Paths in High-Entropy Alloy Composition Space</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44210-025-00057-3</link>

                Abstract The stability of a nanoparticle catalyst during electrochemical reaction is crucial for its application. Despite increasing interest in multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs), for electrocatalysis and emerging models for their catalytic activity, there is limited work on frameworks that can predict the metastability of these alloys under reaction conditions, including stability against electrochemical surface dissolution. Incorporating electrochemical stability in multi-objective optimization would advance HEAs as a catalyst discovery platform. To address the knowledge gap on electrochemical stability, we propose a methodology for simulating the dissolution of n-element alloy nanoparticles comprised of density functional theory and machine-learning regression to calculate the dissolution potentials of the surface atoms. We demonstrate the methodology for the Ag&#8211;Au&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt&#8211;Rh&#8211;Ru HEA system with the conditions of the oxygen reduction reaction. We investigated trends in stability against dissolution through a compositional grid search for the octo-metallic composition space, uncovering two alloying strategies to increase stability against electrochemical surface dissolution: Alloying with a noble metal or a metal with high relative surface energy. In the simulations, stabilization ensues from forming a protective surface layer, and consequently, the dissolution of persistent alloyed nanoparticles results in core&#8211;shell structures. The model enables tracing the evolution of the surface and dissolved composition during electrochemical dissolution, forming paths of dissolution and revealing unretainable surface compositions.

      <description>Nutth Tuchinda, G. B. Olson, Christopher A. Schuh, Applied Physics Letters. 126(17)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409933088

                Grain boundary chemistry plays a critical role for the properties of metals and alloys, yet there is a lack of consistent datasets for alloy design and development. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials science, open materials models and datasets can be used to overcome such challenges. Here, we use a universal interatomic potential to compute a grain boundary segregation and embrittlement genome for the &#931;5[001](210) grain boundary for FCC and BCC binary alloys. The grain boundary database calculated here serves as a design tool for the embrittlement of high-angle grain boundaries for alloys across 30 base metals of Ag, Al, Au, Ba, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe (both BCC and FCC), Ir, K, Li, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rb, Rh, Sr, Ta, Ti, V, W, Yb, and Zr with 75 solute elements for each.</description>

                Abstract Nickel&#8208;based catalysts are among the most promising materials for electrocatalytic water splitting, particularly for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and tunable electrochemical properties make them attractive alternatives to precious metal catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the advancements in nickel&#8208;based catalysts, including pure nickel, alloys, oxides, hydroxides, and spinels, emphasizing their synthesis methods, structural properties, and electrocatalytic performance. Recent nanostructuring, doping, and hybridization innovations with conductive supports have significantly enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and efficiency. Despite notable progress, challenges remain in improving long&#8208;term durability, minimizing surface degradation, and scaling up production for industrial applications. Addressing these limitations through advanced catalyst design, in situ characterization, and integration with renewable energy sources will be crucial for widely adopting nickel&#8208;based catalysts in sustainable hydrogen production. This review highlights the key developments and future directions in the field, underscoring the role of nickel&#8208;based materials in enabling the hydrogen economy and global decarbonization efforts.</description>

                The activation of CO 2 is essential for efficient electrochemical conversion, yet its weak physisorption on pristine Cu surfaces severely hinders catalytic performance. To overcome this limitation, we designed Cu stepped structures to create highly reactive sites for enhanced CO 2 adsorption and further doped the edges with 3 d transition metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) to improve CO 2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these dopants significantly reduce the O&#63743;C&#63743;O angles and elongate the C&#63743;O bonds, transforming CO 2 from its original linear configuration into a bent geometry at the interface. Notably, dual&#8208;V and dual&#8208;Fe doping on Cu stepped surfaces demonstrates a strong interaction with CO 2 , leading to a high degree of activation. The computational results demonstrate that these modifications significantly enhance CO 2 activation and favor methane generation. This study provides valuable insights into the design of advanced Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts for efficient and selective CO 2 activation, offering a pathway toward sustainable CO 2 utilization.</description>

                Abstract An innovative palladium&#8208;doped zinc cobalt oxide nanoelectrocatalyst, ZnPd x Co 2&#8208;x O 4 (0.00 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.08)@NF, is successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The resulting material exhibits a spinel oxide phase, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The electrocatalytic performance of ZnPd x Co 2&#8208;x O 4 (0.00 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.08)@NF is evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show significant improvements in efficient hydrogen production, with an overpotential of 31 mV, a Tafel slope of 54.36 mV dec&#8315; 1 , and sustained stability for over 72 h, using chronopotentiometry methods. Doping with 8.0% Pd concentration enhances the highest electrochemical performance of the nanoelectrocatalyst, supporting the idea that Pd doping improves HER activity. The results suggest that the increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and faster charge transfer kinetics at the interface between the semiconductor and electrolyte contribute to enhanced performance. The DFT calculations performed in this work confirm the role of Pd in improving the catalytic activity of the ZnCo 2 O 4 spinel catalyst. Overall, this study has made a significant contribution to the development of sustainable energy solutions, offering a promising path toward the efficient production of hydrogen fuel.</description>

                The development of stable and efficient single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains challenging. This work reports a novel NH3-assisted pyrolysis strategy to synthesize Co-N4 SACs with controlled nitrogen coordination environments on crumpled graphene supports. The pyrrolic N4-coordinated Co sites demonstrate superior OER activity compared to their pyridinic counterparts, achieving an overpotential of 351 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 m H2SO4. Combined density functional theory calculations and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that the pyrrolic coordination environment facilitates enhanced OH- adsorption and subsequent OER kinetics due to its unique electronic structure and geometric flexibility. A multi-layered protective mechanism in the pyrrolic system enables exceptional stability during long-term acidic OER operation, stemming from higher defect formation energy of Co sites and strategic distribution of sacrificial nitrogen species in the graphene network. These findings provide fundamental insights into designing stable single-atom catalysts for challenging electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Realizing Direct Hot-Electron Transfer from Metal Nanoparticles to Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c00373</link>
      <description>P. K. Verma, Samir Kumar Nayak, Khushboo Bhardwaj, Sharma S. R. K. C. Yamijala, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409984514

                Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of forever synthetic chemicals. They are widely utilized in industries and household appliances because of their remarkable stability and distinctive oil- and water-repellent properties. Despite their broad applications, unfortunately, PFAS are hazardous to all forms of life, including humans. In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS has raised significant interest in degrading these substances. However, the strong C-F bonds in these chemicals pose several challenges to their degradation. Plasmons of noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) offer many exciting applications, including photocatalytic reactions. However, an atomistic understanding of plasmon-driven processes remains elusive. In this work, using the real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we have studied the real-time formation of plasmons, hot-carrier generation, and subsequent direct hot-carrier transfer from metal NPs to the PFAS. Our simulations show that there is an apparent direct hot-electron transfer from NPs to PFAS. Moreover, using Ehrenfest dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that the transferred hot electrons can efficiently degrade PFAS without requiring any external thermal bath. Thus, our work provides an atomistic picture of plasmon-induced direct hot-carrier transfer from NPs to PFAS and the efficient degradation of PFAS. We strongly believe that this work generates the impetus to utilize plasmonic NPs to mitigate PFAS.</description>

      <title>The Role of Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Oxygen Evolution Activity of Copper Oxides</title>

                Cu-based oxides and hydroxides represent an important class of materials from a catalytic and corrosion perspective. In this study, we investigate the formation of bulk and surface Cu3+ species that are stable under water oxidation catalysis in alkaline media. So far, no direct evidence existed for the presence of hydroxides (CuOOH) or oxides, which were primarily proposed by theory. This work directly places CuOOH in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) Pourbaix stability region with a calculated free energy of -208.68 kJ/mol, necessitating a revision of known Cu-H2O phase diagrams. We also predict that the active sites of CuOOH for the OER are consistent with a bridge O* site between the two Cu3+ atoms with onset at &#8805;1.6 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), aligning with experimentally observed Cu2+/3+ oxidation waves in cyclic voltammetry of Fe-free and Fe-spiked copper in alkaline media. Trace amounts of Fe (2 &#956;g/mL (ppm) to 5 &#956;g/mL) in the solution measurably enhance the catalytic activity of the OER, likely due to the adsorption of Fe species that serve as the active sites . Importantly, modulation excitation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ME-XAS) of a Cu thin-film electrode shows a distinct Cu3+ fingerprint under OER conditions at 1.8 V vs RHE. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy of polycrystalline Cu in 0.1 mol/L (M) KOH revealed features consistent with those calculated for CuOOH in addition to CuO. Overall, this work provides direct evidence of bulk electrochemical Cu3+ species under OER conditions and expands our longstanding understanding of the oxidation mechanism and catalytic activity of copper.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser-induced diffusion and desorption of CO adsorbed on a weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling surface: Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0256832</link>
      <description>Federico J. Gonzalez, Alberto S. Muzas, J. I. Juaristi, M. Alducin, H. F. Busnengo, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(17)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410005931

                In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CO molecules chemisorbed on Cu(110) under femtosecond laser irradiation. We use the two temperature model and a previously developed potential energy surface based on density functional theory total energies (obtained using the nonlocal vdW-DF2 functional) and parameterized using artificial neural networks. We find that laser irradiation induces diffusion parallel to [1&#772;10] much more efficiently than parallel to [001] due to a significantly smaller energy barrier in the former case (i.e., 0.12 vs 0.49 eV). We also observe photoinduced desorption (an endothermic process characterized by &#916;E = 0.6 eV) with a probability that exhibits a power law dependence with laser fluence. At the lowest fluence studied (F = 30 J m-2), for which experimental data are available, the theoretical photoinduced diffusion probabilities both parallel and perpendicular to [1&#772;10] agree with the measured values, whereas our calculations predict desorption probabilities smaller than those obtained in experiments. Our MD simulations show that (i) the energy exchange with the hot electron bath is the main responsible for photoinduced processes and (ii) phonons tend to reduce the kinetic energy of the adsorbate, as keeping fixed the position of the Cu atoms during the simulations (thereby quenching CO-phonon energy exchange) significantly increases CO diffusion and desorption probabilities. Thus, our study advances the understanding of ultrafast surface dynamics on metal surfaces with weak electron-phonon coupling, and we hope that it will motivate further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>LAGNet: better electron density prediction for LCAO-based data and drug-like substances</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-025-01010-7</link>
      <description>Konstantin Ushenin, Kuzma Khrabrov, Artem Tsypin, Anton Ber, Egor Rumiantsev, Artur Kadurin, Journal of Cheminformatics. 17(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409922207

                The electron density is an important object in quantum chemistry that is crucial for many downstream tasks in drug design. Recent deep learning approaches predict the electron density around a molecule from atom types and atom positions. Most of these methods use the plane wave (PW) numerical method as a source of ground-truth training data. However, the drug design field mostly uses the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) for computation of quantum properties. In this study, we focus on prediction of the electron density for drug-like substances and training neural networks with LCAO-based datasets. Our experiments show that proper handling of large amplitudes of core orbitals is crucial for training on LCAO-based data. We propose to store the electron density with the standard grids instead of the uniform grid. This allowed us to reduce the number of probing points per molecule by 43 times and reduce storage space requirements by 8 times. Finally, we propose a novel architecture based on the DeepDFT model that we name LAGNet. It is specifically designed and tuned for drug-like substances and &#8711;2 DFT dataset.</description>

                Machine learning and automation are transforming scientific research, yet the implementation of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) remains costly and complex, and it remains difficult to learn how to use these facilities. To address this, we introduce Claude-Light, a lightweight, remotely accessible instrument designed for prototyping automation algorithms and machine learning workflows. Claude-Light integrates a REST API, a Raspberry Pi-based control system, and an RGB LED with a photometer that measures ten spectral outputs, providing a controlled but realistic experimental environment. This device enables users to explore automation at multiple levels, from basic programming and experimental design to machine learning-driven optimization. We demonstrate the application of Claude-Light in structured automation approaches, including traditional scripting, statistical design of experiments, and active learning methods. In addition, we explore the role of large language models (LLMs) in laboratory automation, highlighting their use in instrument selection, structured data extraction, function calling, and code generation. While LLMs present new opportunities for streamlining automation, they also introduce challenges related to reproducibility, security, and reliability. We discuss strategies to mitigate these risks while leveraging LLMs for enhanced efficiency in self-driving laboratories. Claude-Light provides a practical and accessible platform for students and researchers to develop automation skills and test algorithms before deploying them in larger-scale SDLs. By lowering the barrier to entry for automation in scientific research, this tool facilitates broader adoption of AI-driven experimentation and fosters innovation in autonomous laboratories.</description>
