                Abstract Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O 2 ) batteries are perceived as a promising breakthrough in sustainable electrochemical energy storage, utilizing ambient air as an energy source, eliminating the need for costly cathode materials, and offering the highest theoretical energy density (~ 3.5 kWh kg &#8211;1 ) among discussed candidates. Contributing to the poor cycle life of currently reported Li&#8211;O 2 cells is singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) formation, inducing parasitic reactions, degrading key components, and severely deteriorating cell performance. Here, we harness the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of chiral cobalt oxide nanosheets (Co 3 O 4 NSs) as cathode materials to suppress 1 O 2 in Li&#8211;O 2 batteries for the first time. Operando photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a 3.7-fold and 3.23-fold reduction in 1 O 2 during discharge and charge, respectively, compared to conventional carbon paper-based cells, consistent with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry results, which indicate a near-theoretical charge-to-O 2 ratio (2.04 e &#8722; /O 2 ). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that chirality induces a peak shift near the Fermi level, enhancing Co 3 d &#8211;O 2 p hybridization, stabilizing reaction intermediates, and lowering activation barriers for Li 2 O 2 formation and decomposition. These findings establish a new strategy for improving the stability and energy efficiency of sustainable Li&#8211;O 2 batteries, abridging the current gap to commercialization.</description>

                This work reports the synthesis and electropolymerization of 4&#8208;aminophenoxy&#8208;substituted Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine to prepare a phenazine (PNZ)&#8208;bridged Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine polymer as a durable catalyst for heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECO 2 R). At &#8211;1.19 V versus normal hydrogen electrode, the ECO 2 R under catalysis of the target polymer effectively produces CO with 94% faradaic efficiency (FE CO ), CO partial current density of 5.5 mA cm &#8722;2 , and turnover frequency of 1.1 s &#8722;1 over 2 h. Moreover, the polymeric system exhibits remarkably higher stability than the monomeric one by achieving average FE CO , current density and a turnover number of up to 93%, 7 mA cm &#8722;2 and 5.3 &#215; 10 5 , respectively, along 120&#8208;h electrolysis. Variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry indicates efficient electron transfer within polymeric bulk through the PNZ linkage, while in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals a higher proportion of electrochemically active Co I species in the polymer film than the monomer one. In addition, density functional theory calculations using the real&#8208;space GPAW framework are conducted to investigate charge penetration in the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer network in comparison to that in the monomeric counterpart. These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of the robust Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based catalyst and contribute to the progress of an efficient CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202519434</link>
      <description>Huimin Qi, Lu Fan, Qichang Li, Qin Wu, Zhongyang Kang, Yuying Hou, Lina Su, Shaobo Li, Zhiqi Huang, Guang Feng, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413539743

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrocatalysts due to their unique structural features and superior physicochemical properties. A key breakthrough in this field is the development of ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials (&lt;5 nm), which establish HEAs as sufficiently advanced catalysts with extremely superior performance. Despite rapid progress, a comprehensive review of the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;activity relationships of sub&#8208;5 nm HEA nanomaterials is still absent. This review provides the first systematic overview specifically focusing on sub&#8208;5 nm ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials for electrocatalytic applications. In particular, this review comprehensively summarizes recent research on ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials, focusing on their synthesis strategies, characterization methods, unique properties, and electrocatalytic applications, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR), and formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Furthermore, this work originally proposes some unique advantages of ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials, including the enhanced utilization of metal atoms, optimal binding energy, and remarkable nano&#8208;size effects. Meanwhile, it discusses the challenges and future directions for ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials. This work aims to offer valuable insights for advancing the field and the development of efficient electrocatalysts for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Surface Defects on WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Photoelectrodes for Catalyzing Chloride Oxidation in Water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.5c01806</link>

                Tungsten oxide (WO3) is an n-type semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies (&#9633;O&#8226;&#8226; in Kroger-Vink notation) or surface protonation as HxWO3. It is one of the few acid-stable oxides under large positive bias, which makes WO3 ideal for interrogating the mechanism of the chloride oxidation reaction (COR). The large, positive valence band edge of &#8764;3 eV provides the overpotential necessary to carry out the COR, but the reaction competes with the oxygen-evolution reaction in water. The &#9633;O&#8226;&#8226; defect density can be controlled by the atmosphere under which the material is annealed, so WO3 films were prepared by a spin-coating method from an ammonium metatungstate precursor annealed at 500 &#176;C under air, flowing O2, and flowing argon. Annealing the films in a flowing O2 atmosphere hinders the formation of &#9633;O&#8226;&#8226;, and annealing in Ar leads to greater surface W6+, likely due to expelling intercalated H+. The saturated photocurrent density (jph) is highest in films with the greatest concentration of W5+ and greatest concentration of oxide defects: (0.66 mA/cm2 annealed in air, 0.58 mA/cm2 annealed in Ar, and 0.49 mA/cm2 annealed in O2, reported at 1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, pH 3 (before the onset of a dark reaction). The defect concentrations are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In all cases the Faradaic efficiency for the COR is near unity. Finally, we demonstrate that W 5d states can be probed by ligand K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy via pre-edge (Cl 1s &#8594; W 5d) transitions, lower in energy than the ligand-centered (Cl 1s &#8594; 4p) transition. We use this analysis to show the presence of W&#9472;Cl covalent bonds on the WO3 films post-COR, corroborated by DFT calculations. This result stands in contrast to the commonly assumed mechanistic proposal invoking outer-sphere electron transfer to a physisorbed chloride ion.</description>

                Two-dimensional (2D) S-scheme heterojunctions have garnered significant interest, owing to their remarkable redox capability and excellent potential in solar energy harvesting. In the work, a 2D/2D S-scheme heterojunction consisting of monolayer Bi2O2Se and Bi2WO6 was designed, and its performance in photocatalytic water splitting was comprehensively investigated using first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction features well-aligned electronic band structures and generates an intrinsic built-in electric field directed from Bi2O2Se toward Bi2WO6. The internal electric field promotes effective charge separation via the S-scheme mechanism, significantly reducing carrier recombination and improving the dissociation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Furthermore, Gibbs free energy calculations indicate that solar energy can drive spontaneous water splitting of the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction. Owing to its efficient S-scheme charge migration and strong light-harvesting capability across a wide spectral range, the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction exhibits an impressive solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency that reaches 23.48%. These findings demonstrate that the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 S-scheme heterojunction is a highly promising and stable photocatalyst for efficient solar-driven hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Surface local strain and diatomic iron doping synergistically promote the plasmonic photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0281781</link>
      <description>Tai-Rui Wu, Ziwei Ma, Jiazheng Wang, Jian&#8208;Zhang Zhou, De&#8208;Yin Wu, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413600242

                Utilizing single/dual atom catalysts as well as the crystallographic plane effect to promote the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted extensive attention. However, there are few works to combine the two effects with the surface plasmon resonance effect based on the first-principles periodic slab models. Our calculated results can be summarized as three points. First, we investigated the adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) of *N2 and *NNH on Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) facets with single or dual Fe atoms doped. The strongest end-on and side-on adsorption occur at single and dimer Fe atoms doped Au(100) surfaces, respectively. More importantly, the N2 side-on adsorption configuration significantly reduces the &#916;G of the first hydrogenation step. Second, we investigated the reason why there is a lower adsorption &#916;G for the N2 side-on adsorption on dimer-Fe-doped Au(100). It was discovered that the interatomic distance of the Fe dimer exhibits a strong correlation with adsorption strength. When the Fe dimer is doped on the Au(100) surface, the dimer will relax due to local strain, enabling a stronger N2 side-on adsorption. Finally, we compared the photon absorption capacity between side-on and end-on nitrogen adsorption configurations, revealing that the latter exhibits enhanced light absorption capability at lower photon energies and across broader wavelength ranges. This theoretical research highlights the superiority of the N2 side-on adsorption configuration in plasmonic photoelectrochemical NRR and shows the influence of surface local strain and dynamic relaxation for side-on adsorption, which could be referenced to design efficient side-on adsorption catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen spillover, the migration of metal&#8208;activated hydrogen species across support surfaces, is key for many H&#8208;related reactions. However, questions remain about how the metal/oxide interfaces affect hydrogen spillover and hydrogenation reaction. Here, we construct Mn 3 O 4 &#8208;on&#8208;Pt(111) (Mn 3 O 4 /Pt(111)) inverse catalyst and Pt clusters&#8208;on&#8208;Mn 3 O 4 (Pt/Mn 3 O 4 ) catalyst, and image hydrogen spillover behavior using high&#8208;pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the onset H 2 partial pressure for hydrogen spillover is two orders of magnitude lower at Mn 3 O 4 /Pt(111) than at Pt/Mn 3 O 4 . This structural promotion effect was leveraged to synthesize MnO x /Pt/C inverse catalyst by depositing MnO x on Pt nanoparticles, which exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher CO 2 conversion compared to conventional Pt/MnO x /C catalyst during CO 2 hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations reveal that the inverse catalysts promote hydrogen spillover via weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry at interfacial Pt sites, particularly along the Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway.

                Abstract Hydrogen spillover, the migration of metal&#8208;activated hydrogen species across support surfaces, is key for many H&#8208;related reactions. However, questions remain about how the metal/oxide interfaces affect hydrogen spillover and hydrogenation reaction. Here, we construct Mn 3 O 4 &#8208;on&#8208;Pt(111) (Mn 3 O 4 /Pt(111)) inverse catalyst and Pt clusters&#8208;on&#8208;Mn 3 O 4 (Pt/Mn 3 O 4 ) catalyst, and image hydrogen spillover behavior using high&#8208;pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the onset H 2 partial pressure for hydrogen spillover is two orders of magnitude lower at Mn 3 O 4 /Pt(111) than at Pt/Mn 3 O 4 . This structural promotion effect was leveraged to synthesize MnO x /Pt/C inverse catalyst by depositing MnO x on Pt nanoparticles, which exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher CO 2 conversion compared to conventional Pt/MnO x /C catalyst during CO 2 hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations reveal that the inverse catalysts promote hydrogen spillover via weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry at interfacial Pt sites, particularly along the Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway. The Pt/Mn 3 O 4 interfaces feature strong H binding on Pt &#948; &#8314; and high H diffusion barriers, which can be partially mitigated by CO co&#8208;adsorption. These findings demonstrate that inverse structure offers both electronic and geometric advantages at the interfaces, enabling efficient hydrogen spillover for hydrogenation reactions.</description>

      <title>Computational screening of single-atom catalysts supported on triazine-based graphite carbon nitride for 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination</title>

      <description>Huiming Xue, Yu Huang, Yi Li, Yongfan Zhang, Wei Lin, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413623745

                In this study, we systematically investigated the performance of eight transition metal atom-loaded triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride (TM@TGCN) for the catalysis of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) dechlorination reaction (DCEDR) by density functional theory calculations. Through the five-step screening method, the suitable catalysts, respectively, applicable to the generation of vinyl chloride (CH2CHCl), ethylene (CH2CH2), and ethane (CH3CH3) were finally determined. The limiting potential of Fe@TGCN for reducing 1,2-DCE to CH3CH3 is lower, at &#8722;0.47 V (gauche-C2H4Cl2) and &#8722;0.50 V (trans-C2H4Cl2), respectively. The activity mechanism indicates that Fe@TGCN is at the vertex of the volcano plot, confirming that the intensity of its interaction with the reactants is in optimal equilibrium. In addition, we further examined the influence of hydroxyl modification on the selectivity of DCEDR. The results show that hydroxyl modification significantly weakens the adsorption strength of intermediates (such as *CH2CH2Cl) through a steric hindrance effect and electron delocalization, as well as reduces the desorption energy of CH2CH2 and enhances its selectivity. This study provides theoretical guidance for the rational design of DCEDR electrocatalysts and reveals the key role of ligand modification strategies in regulating the reaction pathway.</description>

                The nuclear&#8211;electronic orbital (NEO) method provides a powerful computational framework for incorporating nuclear quantum effects (NQE) in electronic structure calculations beyond the Born&#8211;Oppenheimer approximation. By incorporating additional constraints to the position operator on quantum particles like protons, the NEO method enables calculation of effective potential that accounts for NQE. In this work, we present a new constrained NEO (cNEO) formulation for density functional theory (cNEO-DFT) calculations in the context of extended periodic systems. Using the nudged elastic band method, we discuss an application of the cNEO-DFT approach to studying the adsorption of a hydrogen molecule on the Si(001) surfaces. The calculation shows how NQE impacts the reaction energetics. The proton density changes are computed along the reaction pathways. This work demonstrates the capability of the new cNEO-DFT method to study a wide range of chemical processes, such as surface reactions where the quantum nature of light atoms like protons is non-negligible.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cnma.202500260</link>
      <description>Edris Madadian, Yasaman Ghaffari, Yael Zilberman, David S. A. Simakov, ChemNanoMat. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413637514

                Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their high chemical and thermal stability and, in particular, due to their electronic structure that is similar to that of platinum group metals (PGMs). This similarity in the electronic structure, alongside significantly lower cost (compared to PGMs), made TMCs particularly interesting for catalysis applications. Indeed, recent advances in utilizing TMCs have revealed their excellent performance in various catalytic processes. This review explores several essential aspects of customizing TMCs for thermocatalytic reactions. In this context, physical and chemical properties of TMCs are first discussed. It is shown that the unique properties of TMCs are attributed to their charge polarization, structural adjustability, capacity to form alloys, and ability to undergo phase transitions. Next, various synthesis techniques are reviewed, including solid&#8208;state and solvothermal methods, as well as microwave&#8208; and plasma&#8208;assisted techniques. The review then focuses on the utilization of TMCs in thermocatalytic processes, including those used for generation of renewable synthetic fuels and chemicals. Among applications discussed are water gas shift, reforming, CO 2 reduction and hydrogenation, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and isomerization. For each application, design strategies and the impact of the catalyst composition and morphology on the catalytic performance are discussed. Each section incorporates case studies, including experiments and theoretical investigations that provide additional insights into catalyst design considerations. The review is concluded with a critical discussion of challenges associated with the design, synthesis, and utilization of TMCs and of future research directions. This review offers fundamental insights into tailoring TMCs for applications in thermocatalysis, showing that TMCs are emerging catalytic materials for thermocatalytic processes, such as production of renewables synthetic fuels and chemicals.</description>

                Coupled photoelectrochemistry and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) provide a unique platform for monitoring photocatalyzed and photoelectrocatalyzed reactions. The combination of catalysis and detection platforms typically requires sophisticated synthesis procedures, which make them prohibitive to implement. In this work, we have designed and fabricated a controllable array of Au nanoparticles (NPs) on a templated TiO2 substrate for the simultaneous photoelectrochemical degradation and in situ electrochemical-SERS monitoring, where 4-nitrothiophenol (4NTP) was used as a molecular probe. The effect of the dimension of the Au NPs was studied, showing that the array of 42.2 nm diameter Au NPs exhibited the best degradation kinetics of 4NTP at 0.017 min&#8211;1 and the highest SERS response for detection and monitoring. Polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations were further employed to understand the 4NTP response to the applied electric field. It was found that the angle of adsorbed 4NTP was highly dependent on the applied potential, resulting in changes in the effective dipole moment of the molecule. The implementation of this combined platform provides insights into surface reaction kinetics for photocatalyzed reactions on metal oxide surfaces.</description>

      <title>Finding Catalyst Design Principles for Oxygen Evolution using High&#8208;Throughput Optimizations and Electrochemical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202501198</link>

                The global&#8208;scale use of water electrolyzers for sustainable hydrogen production is currently limited by the lack of efficient, abundant, and stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, OER models based on adsorption energies of the intermediates and their scaling relations have led to the customary but unsafe use of heuristic rules as design principles for catalyst design. Conversely, guidelines derived from the concept of electrochemical symmetry have yet to be exploited despite their simplicity and quantitative nature. Here, a high&#8208;throughput analysis on a sizable dataset is performed using a variety of scaling&#8208;free, scaling&#8208;based optimizations, and combinations thereof, while keeping track of the material's degree of electrochemical symmetry. This analysis provides an important conclusion: a visible improvement in the OER activity is statistically linked to an increase in the number of electrochemical steps larger than 1.23 eV. This is not a mere rule of thumb but a quantitative criterion to safely guide the design and enhancement of OER catalyst materials.</description>

      <title>Adsorbed oxygen dynamics at forced convection interface in the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63181-z</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction is a prevalent anodic reaction in electrocatalytic processes. Modulation of adsorbed oxygen (*O) at the electrochemical interface is an effective means to reduce the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the contribution of various *O conversions to the overpotential remains unclear. Herein, the development of a multi-component forced convection electrochemical mass spectrometry constructs *O-labeled electrochemical interfaces with specific coverages to track the *O conversions. The relationships between the Faradic contributions and the specific *O conversion pathways are established by considering the anomalous fractionation of molecule oxygen. Our experiments confirm that *O coupling contributes up to 48% with a specific overpotential on full coverage platinum. Distinguishing the *O conversion contributions with various coverages reveals that balancing the *O formation and conversions, especially *O coupling enables further minimization of the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction. Thus, tracking the intermediate conversions has implications for designing high-performance electrocatalytic interfaces. The oxygen evolution reaction is central to electrochemistry, yet how its intermediates contribute to overpotential is unclear. Here, the authors use a multi-component forced-convection mass-spectrometry system to label adsorbed oxygen and reveal its conversion through product fractionation.</description>

                Realizing a single step synthesis protocol for conducting the Cu0.87Se phase in nanosheet form deals with an exciting yet unmapped target demanding a simple procedure. In this pursuit, the current study defines a molecular template approach for hexagonal phase Cu0.87Se nanosheets (NSs) by heat-up of a new and structurally characterized precursor, {Cu(2-SeC4H3N2)}4, in oleylamine (OAm), while agglomerated cubic phase Cu1.8Se nanoparticles (NPs) was produced when the same precursor was pyrolyzed. Subsequently, both the precursor and the nanostructures were identified by a number of characterization tools such as single crystal/powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Moreover, all the nanostructures were evaluated for their prospects as catalysts for water splitting. Furthermore, periodic density functional theory (DFT) studies were performed to explore the catalytic water oxidation reaction over the Cu0.87Se and CuSe surfaces along with the restructured CuO surface.</description>

                Lithium thiophosphate (LPS) is a promising solid electrolyte for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its superior energy storage, high ionic conductivity, and low-flammability properties. Despite its potential, the high reactivity of LPS with common contaminants such as atmospheric water, preparation solvents, and electrode materials poses significant challenges for commercialization. The lack of understanding regarding the structure, morphology, and chemical behavior of the surface of LPS slows down the search for solutions to these issues. Here, we utilize a machine-learning interatomic potential to achieve a fundamental atomistic understanding of the mechanical and chemical properties of the &#946;-Li3PS4 surfaces. Employing molecular-dynamics simulations, we identify relevant complexions formed by surface reconstructions, determine their surface energies, and compute the Wulff shape of &#946;-LPS. The most stable complexions exhibit properties distinctly different from the bulk, including amorphization, increased density, decreased conductivity, and large deformation of the structural building blocks. We demonstrate that these surfaces are not static but undergo significant dynamical activity at room temperature, which is clearly identified by an analysis featuring a time-averaged structural descriptor. Finally, we examine the changes of the electronic structure induced by the surface complexions as well as their effect on the reaction enthalpy with water, which provides us with details on changes in surface reactivity and active sites, underlining the importance of investigating surface complexions under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Breaking the curse of dimensionality: Solving configurational integrals for crystalline solids by tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/xrbw-xr49</link>

                Accurately evaluating configurational integrals for dense solids remains a central and difficult challenge in the statistical mechanics of condensed systems. Here, we present a tensor network approach that reformulates the high-dimensional configurational integral for identical-particle crystals into a sequence of computationally efficient summations. We represent the integrand as a high-dimensional tensor and apply tensor-train (TT) decomposition together with a custom TT-cross interpolation. This approach circumvents the need to explicitly construct the full tensor. We introduce tailored rank-1 and rank-2 schemes optimized for sharply peaked Boltzmann probability densities, typical for identical-particle crystals. When applied to the calculation of internal energy and pressure-temperature curves for crystalline Cu and Ar at high (GPa) pressures, as well as the alpha-to-beta phase transition diagram of Sn, our method accurately reproduces molecular dynamics simulation results using tight-binding, machine learning, hierarchical interacting particle&#8211;neural network, and modified embedded atom method potentials,all within seconds of computation time.</description>

      <title>Single-atom catalysts based on one-dimensional metal porphyrin chains toward oxygen reduction reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0280114</link>

                Single-atom catalysts has emerged as a groundbreaking concept in catalysis, where individual metal atoms are anchored on supports such as carbon-based materials, oxides, or nitrides, serving as isolated active sites for catalytic reactions. In the present study, we theoretically explore the geometries, bonding properties, electronic structures, and potential catalytic performances of the recently synthesized one-dimensional (1D) M-porphyrin chains, in which the M&#8211;N4&#8211;C motif acts as the active site for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). Three configurations of 1D M-porphyrin chains (M = Ni, Zn) were investigated, including (a) M-porphyrin ribbon, (b) butadiyne-linked M-porphyrin, and (c) M-porphyrin-fused graphene nanoribbons. The calculation results reveal that all those 1D M-porphyrin chains are semiconductors. Energy decomposition analysis combined with natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV) shows that the metal&#8211;ligand interaction in Ni-porphyrin is stronger than that in Zn-porphyrin. Compared to Zn-porphyrin chains, Ni-porphyrin chains exhibit stronger adsorption and superior electron transfer capabilities, which is attributed to enhanced orbital hybridization between the Ni 3d atomic orbitals and adsorbed oxygen 2p orbitals. The catalytic reaction pathways of these chains are similar for all those SACs and depend slightly on linker types, highlighting the importance of the local environment of the M&#8211;N4&#8211;C coordination framework. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of SACs with tailored properties, offering significant potential for applications in energy conversion and environmental catalysis.</description>

      <title>Optimizing machine learning interatomic potentials for hydroxide transport: Surprising efficiency of single-concentration training</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0284063</link>
      <description>Jonas H&#228;nseroth, Christian Dre&#223;ler, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413772894

                We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K+, OH&#8722;, and H2O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from 30 meV &#197;&#8722;1 (at training concentration) to 90 meV &#197;&#8722;1 (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol l&#8722;1) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56&#8211;17.89 mol l&#8722;1), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide&#8211;hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations&#8212;a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</description>

                In recent years, artificial intelligence has gained significant traction in Earth sciences, driving a shift from qualitative approaches to quantitative, data-driven methodologies. In geomorphology, artificial intelligence techniques are now applied at multiple scales and for diverse purposes, leveraging a wide spectrum of methods including supervised and unsupervised machine learning, regression algorithms, classification models, clustering techniques, neural networks, and dimensionality reduction. This study presents a structured bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature indexed in Scopus, analyzing over 2000 articles published between 1990 and 2024. Through a bibliometric approach, we explore temporal trends, the most commonly used artificial intelligence techniques, thematic domains, geographic patterns, and associated keywords. Results reveal the pervasive use of artificial intelligence in key geomorphological areas, particularly in fluvial, coastal, and erosional contexts, alongside the adoption of a rich variety of algorithms. The study also highlights the wide range of AI techniques applied in geomorphological research, spanning from traditional machine learning models to advanced neural architectures. This review provides a critical overview of the current landscape and outlines future directions to support more transparent, equitable, and integrated adoption of artificial intelligence in geomorphological research. The findings of this study are relevant to a wide range of stakeholders. Researchers and Ph.D. candidates can use the results to identify dominant thematic and methodological trajectories and detect underexplored areas. Data scientists and AI specialists may benefit from the mapped applications to implement advanced techniques in geomorphological contexts. The analysis also offers useful insights for funding agencies aiming to support strategic and equitable research development, particularly in underrepresented regions. Finally, journal editors and publishers may use emerging trends to inform the design of thematic issues and research priorities.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;loading iridium (Ir) catalysts hold great promise for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their typically high Ir utilization and reduced cost. However, their practical application is limited by poor stability under the harsh acidic oxidative conditions of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, a controlled structural transformation strategy is presented that converts an unstable LiCoO 2 &#8208;supported Ir single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ir&#8208;LiCoO 2 ) into a corrosion&#8208;resistant Co 3 O 4 &#8208;supported IrO x nanocluster catalyst (IrO x /Co 3 O 4 ), significantly enhancing catalyst durability. Strong catalyst&#8208;support interactions between IrO x and Co 3 O 4 facilitate charge transfer, thereby stabilizing the IrO x nanoclusters against leaching and optimizing the electronic structure of the Ir active sites. As a result, IrO x /Co 3 O 4 exhibits substantially enhanced OER performance compared to Ir&#8208;LiCoO 2 , achieving excellent operational stability over 1200 h and a low overpotential of &#8776;233 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . This superior performance is further validated in PEM electrolyzers, confirming its practical applicability. Furthermore, theoretical calculations reveal that Ir sites in IrO x /Co 3 O 4 exhibit higher dissolution potentials and improve charge transfer capabilities with OER intermediates compare to those in Ir&#8208;LiCoO 2 and IrO 2 , which effectively suppresses Ir leaching and lowers the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step.</description>

                Until recently, the conversation about generative artificial intelligence in science revolved around the textual prowess of large language models such as GPT-3.5 and the promise that they might one day draft a decent literature review. Since then, progress has been nothing short of breathtaking. We now find ourselves in the era of multimodal, agentic systems that listen, see, speak and act, orchestrating cloud software and physical laboratory hardware with a fluency that would have sounded speculative in early 2023. In this review, I merge the substance of our 2024 white paper for the World Economic Forum Top-10-Technologies Report with the latest advances through mid-2025, charting a course from automated literature synthesis and hypothesis generation to self-driving laboratories, organoid intelligence and climate-scale forecasting. The discussion is grounded in emerging governance regimes&#8212;notably the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO 42001&#8212;and is written from the dual vantage-point of a toxicologist who has spent a career championing robust, humane science and of a field chief editor charged with safeguarding scholarly standards in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence . I argue that research is entering a &#8220;co-pilot to lab-pilot&#8221; transition in which AI no longer merely interprets knowledge but increasingly acts upon it . This shift promises dramatic efficiency gains yet simultaneously amplifies concerns about reproducibility, auditability, safety and equitable access.</description>

                Abstract The hydrogenation of benzene is a key reaction in industry, and binary alloys are promising candidates for improving the catalytic efficiency of this process. In this study, the adsorption energies of benzene and hydrogen over random 150 alloys are determined using density functional theory (DFT) calculation, and varied physical properties of alloys are used as descriptors. Four machine learning (ML) models, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM) are employed to predict the adsorption energies. After feature selection and parameter optimization, LGBM model shows the highest prediction accuracy, with correlation coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.813 and 0.415 eV for benzene, as well as 0.874 and 0.176 eV for hydrogen. Therefore, LGBM model is selected to predict the adsorption energies of benzene and hydrogen (&#916;EB and &#916;EH), and Cu2Ni2 has excellent &#916;EB and &#916;EH of -4.97 and &#8722; 1.81 eV.</description>

                Abstract Design and preparation of freestanding bifunctional ordered structural catalysts with superior activity, low cost, and good reversibility, are crucial for commercial water&#8208;splitting applications. In this study, a durable and effective NiS 2 /ReS 2 (NRS) electrocatalyst is successfully fabricated using various quantities of Re source on carbon cloth (CC) by a facile solvothermal method. Upon changing the quantities of the Re source, the catalyst dimensions and shape undergo substantial changes, enabling the control of the catalytic activity of NRS. In particular, the optimal NRS&#8208;50@CC displays remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, revealing small overpotentials of 244 mV at 20 mA cm &#8722;2 and 108 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively, as well as notable stability. Moreover, the NRS&#8208;50@CC (+, &#8722;) cell device requires a voltage of &#8776;1.56 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . This paper proposes a novel approach for the construction of durable bifunctional electrocatalysts using exceptionally active layered metal chalcogenide materials.</description>
