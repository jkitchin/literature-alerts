                Solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting is a process for hydrogen production from a renewable source. The practical implementation of this technology is limited by the low conversion efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction under visible light and the insufficient long-term stability of photocatalysts. Here we demonstrate a dye (Eosin Y)-sensitized photocatalyst for efficient hydrogen production. The topological semimetal CoAs3 achieves a hydrogen production rate of 2688 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 (&#955; &#8805; 420 nm) and an apparent quantum efficiency of 15.2% at &#955; = 500 nm. Efficient photocatalytic activity is attributed to the electronic properties of CoAs3, which facilitate electron transfer at the Eosin Y/CoAs3 interface, determined by transient absorption spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations predict that CoAs3 is a Luttinger semimetal, exhibiting a quadratic band touching point near the Fermi level and an associated topological insulator gap. The carrier mobility of the material facilitates the transfer of injected electrons from the dye to active sites. Herein, we report a topological photocatalyst that exhibits enhanced stability and efficiency for solar hydrogen production. Developing photocatalysts from earth-abundant materials is crucial for sustainable solar hydrogen production, yet challenges in efficiency and stability persist. Here, the authors report that the topological semimetal cobalt triarsenide functions as an active and durable platform for this reaction.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7050160</link>
      <description>&#1053;. &#1052;. &#1048;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, Alexey S. Kashin, Valentine P. Ananikov, Chemistry. 7(5)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414701117

                The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation can remain unused. Of the more than 150,000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>

      <title>Hammett-Inspired Product Baseline for Data-Efficient &#916;-ML in Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00848</link>

                Data-hungry machine learning methods have become a new standard to efficiently navigate chemical compound space for molecular and materials design and discovery. Due to the severe scarcity and cost of high-quality experimental or synthetic simulated training data, however, data-acquisition costs can be considerable. Relying on reasonably accurate approximate legacy baseline labels with low computational complexity represents one of the most effective strategies to curb data-needs, e.g. through &#916;-, transfer-, or multifidelity learning. A surprisingly effective and data-efficient baseline model is presented in the form of a generic coarse-graining Hammett-inspired product (HIP) Ansatz, generalizing the empirical Hammett equation toward arbitrary systems and properties. Numerical evidence for the applicability of HIP includes solvation free energies of molecules, formation energies of quaternary elpasolite crystals, carbon adsorption energies on heterogeneous catalytic surfaces, HOMO-LUMO gaps of metallorganic complexes, activation energies for SN2 reactions, and catalyst-substrate binding energies in cross-coupling reactions. After calibration on the same training sets, HIP yields an effective baseline for improved &#916;-machine learning models with superior data-efficiency when compared to previously introduced specialized domain-specific models.</description>

      <title>How Electrolyte pH Affects the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c14208</link>
      <description>Jay T. Bender, Rohan Yuri Sanspeur, Nicolas Bueno Ponce, Angel E. Valles, Alyssa K. Uvodich, Delia J. Milliron, John R. Kitchin, Joaquin Resasco, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414731738

                Electrolyte pH is known to affect catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). But a clear understanding of why ORR rates respond more strongly to pH over certain catalysts than others has not been developed. Here, we propose that pH effects on the ORR result from electric field induced changes in the binding energies of intermediates involved in kinetically relevant elementary steps. For strongly binding metals (Pt, Ir, Ru, and Pd), whose rates are limited by the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step to form *OOH or remove adsorbed OH (*OH), ORR rates are weakly affected by electrolyte pH. This behavior is observed because the binding energies of the reaction intermediates in these steps are minimally affected by electric field strength. The weak pH dependence is most pronounced for Pt, which shows essentially identical rates in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For weakly binding metals (Au, Ag), whose rates are limited by non-PCET O2 adsorption, ORR rates increase significantly when moving from acidic to alkaline electrolytes. This strong pH dependence results from the stabilization of adsorbed O2 by the increasingly negative electric field present at the catalyst surface under alkaline conditions. We argue that modifying electrolyte pH does not change the rate-determining elementary step for the ORR, but does decrease the apparent activation barrier for O2 adsorption over weakly binding catalysts. These arguments are substantiated by a combination of experimental kinetic studies and atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>A morphotropic phase boundary in MA1&#8722;xFAxPbI3: linking structure, dynamics, and electronic properties</title>

                Abstract Understanding the phase behavior of mixed-cation halide perovskites is critical for optimizing their structural stability and optoelectronic performance. Here, we map the phase diagram of MA 1&#8722; x FA x PbI 3 using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts have emerged as cost&#8208;effective and active alternatives to iridium&#8208;based materials for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. However, their widespread application is constrained by poor stability under high current densities. Herein, an uncoordinated single&#8208;site Ru catalyst embedded within spinel Co 3 O 4 lattice is developed, delivering a current density of 3.0 A cm &#8722; 2 at 2.02 V with an ultra&#8208;low loading of 13.8 &#181;g Ru cm &#8722; 2 and excellent durability over 300 h at 0.7 A cm &#8722; 2 . Notably, a low energy consumption of 46.1 kW h kg &#8722;1 H 2 with an ultralow noble metal cost of 2.1 $ m &#8722; 2 is achieved, far exceeding commercial RuO 2 (48.6 kW h kg &#8722; 1 H 2 and 2280 $ m &#8722; 2 ) and most reported Ir&#8208;based catalysts. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal strong electronic metal&#8211;support interactions (EMSI) between Ru single site and Co 3 O 4 effectively modulate the Ru electronic structure and simultaneously activate adjacent Co sites, lowering the OER energy barrier for activity enhancement. Additionally, the EMSI imparts the catalyst with redox reversibility and structural flexibility, mitigating subsurface oxygen loss and suppressing over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution of both Ru and Co for sustaining stability. This work provides a promising design strategy for advanced Ru&#8208;based catalysts as promising alternatives to IrO 2 for PEM water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract This study reports the application of electrodeposited graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;modified nickel mesh electrodes (GO@Ni&#8208;m) as efficient electrodes for direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). GO@Ni&#8208;m50 (50 cyclic voltammetry cycles) exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity, achieving a (current density &#8764;15.37 mA cm &#8722;2 and onset potential 0.45 V versus Hg/HgO) at 1 M ethanol in 0.1 M KOH, due to improved surface area, conductivity, excellent stability, and low charge transfer resistance (R ct &#8776; 4.5 &#937;&#183;cm 2 ). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a direct mechanism of ethanol electrooxidation to acetaldehyde, at an adsorption energy of &#8722;0.77 eV on GO@Ni&#8208;m50, due to the synergism of GO and Ni&#8208;m. Further surface modification with iron&#8208;nickel (FeNi) and platinum&#8208;carbon (Pt/C) nanoparticles revealed contrasting effects with reduced current densities due to hindered electron mobility through GO layers. Next, the electrooxidation of bioethanol (derived from potato peel fermentation) resulted in a current density of &gt;10 mA cm &#8722;2 , confirming its practical applicability in bioethanol driven alkaline fuel cells. The GO@Ni&#8208;m50 platform demonstrates high efficiency for ethanol and bioethanol oxidation and holds promise for other biomass&#8208;derived alcohol fuels. The future studies on enhancing long&#8208;term durability of the electrodes can enrich their applicability in sustainable electrochemical energy conversion systems.</description>

                The surface structure of the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 film, a typical model water-splitting catalyst, is examined under vacuum and electrochemical conditions using surface X-ray diffraction. The pristine sample has a two-unit-cell-thick strongly polarized SrCoO3 layer at the surface, and the surface termination is predominantly a CoO2 layer with apical oxygen atoms. After electrochemical treatment, the surface was covered with an additional edge-shared CoO6 double layer. The polarization in the SrCoO3 region was greatly reduced. These structural changes were accompanied by an increase in the working electrode current, suggesting a strong relationship between surface structure modulation and catalytic activity. Reversible structural modulation induced by the film's electric potential was observed and was qualitatively understood as atomic displacements caused by the local electric field and change in the Co ionic radii.</description>

      <title>When Are Dopant &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-States Free-Atom-Like? Periodic Trends and Confinement Effects in Single-Atom Alloys</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c07771</link>
      <description>Fabian Berger, Angelos Michaelides, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414788037

                The free-atom-like character of dopant d-states is a defining feature of single-atom alloys (SAAs), contributing to their exceptional selectivity and activity in heterogeneous catalysis. Based on reliable density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the full series of 4d transition metal (TM) dopants embedded in various hosts, we provide a unified perspective on when dopants exhibit this characteristic and how it can be tuned. Only late TM dopants exhibit the narrow, free-atom-like d-bands typically associated with SAAs, whereas early TM dopants display significantly broader d-bands that approach the width of host metal d-bands. This variation is not driven by increased dopant&#8211;host d-state mixing, which remains minimal across the series. Instead, we attribute the observed periodic trend to differences in the spatial extent of the localized dopant states and their overlap with surrounding host atoms, as well as to avoided hybridization associated with d-state filling. We further corroborate that dopant confinement, quantified by the number and proximity of surrounding host atoms, is as a key factor: more confined dopants exhibit broader d-bands, whereas less confined dopants feature narrower d-bands. Reduced dopant confinement also stabilizes high-spin configurations, enhancing spin polarization for certain 4d elements. Together, these findings offer fundamental insights into the origins of the unique electronic structure of SAAs. Building on these findings, we establish design principles for tuning dopant d-band shape and spin and illustrate how such modifications impact catalytic selectivity. The developed guidelines are also encapsulated in a machine learning model that predicts d-band widths, facilitating the rational design of SAAs.</description>

      <title>The Integration of Magnetic Fields and Catalysts for Clean Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202501973</link>
      <description>Ziyong Zhang, Bo Feng, Junting Sun, Guowei Li, Zunming Lu, Junqiang Wang, Juntao Huo, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414793182

                Abstract Electrocatalysis is a crucial approach for achieving clean energy transitions, requiring highly efficient catalytic materials to expedite this process. However, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints is key to discovering next&#8208;generation materials that are both cost&#8208;effective and efficient. The introduction of magnetic fields offers new opportunities for modulating the electronic structures of catalytic materials, optimizing the adsorption/desorption behavior of key intermediates, and enhancing catalytic efficiency. This review starts with the fundamental principles of classical electrocatalytic reactions, and revisits the main mechanisms by which magnetic fields affect magnetic catalytic materials and electrocatalytic systems, including magneto&#8208;thermal effects, magnetohydrodynamic effects, and spin&#8208;selective effects. Focusing on amorphous materials, topological materials, and metal oxides, the review highlights the design of magnetic catalytic materials, the control of magnetic structures, and their response behaviors to external fields. Finally, it discusses the major bottlenecks facing magnetic catalysis and its potential applications in other important small molecule catalytic transformations. This review provides a new perspective for understanding the essence of magnetic field chemistry and accelerating the development of catalytic materials aimed at applications.</description>

      <title>Revealing How Acid Sites Enhance the Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation Performance on Pt Loaded Zeolite&#8208;Carbon Composite Materials</title>

                Abstract The catalytic role and function of acid sites in solid acid catalysts, such as zeolites, are well understood in the context of heterogeneous catalytic reactions. But although many studies have highlighted the importance of acid sites, their catalytic effects in electrocatalytic reactions have rarely been investigated. In this work, a novel catalyst synthesis strategy is developed, integrating metal sites with acid sites for application in the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR). Specifically, an ordered microporous carbon support containing acidic aluminum sites (AlYTC) is prepared through a nanocasting approach using a sacrificial zeolite template. Platinum (Pt) nanoclusters are then deposited onto the AlYTC support, forming a structure that exposes both acid sites and Pt nanoclusters on a zeolite&#8208;templated 3D carbon framework (PtAlYTC). The prepared PtAlYTC catalyst demonstrates a turnover frequency (TOF, s &#8722;1 ) 30 times higher and a reaction rate () 17 times greater than those of a Pt catalyst lacking acid sites (PtYTC) in the EGOR. First&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the combination of Pt sites and acidic Al sites lowers the Gibbs free energy of key reaction steps, improves charge transfer, and strengthens hydrogen adsorption, thereby significantly enhancing the catalytic performance in EGOR.</description>

                Strain is a widely used strategy for electrocatalyst engineering. Overstraining, however, can lead to unintentional materials transformation. We investigate the impact of strain on the surface morphology of a rutile RuO2(110) film grown on a symmetry-matching rutile TiO2(110) substrate. When the film thickness exceeds 9 nm, the RuO2 surface relaxes by forming step edges that expose the {011} plane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows that the (011) facet is among the lower energy surfaces of rutile RuO2, suggesting that this formation incurs minimal energetic penalties. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) shows that the film maintains the (110) structure of the terrace during electrochemistry. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) further reveals the insensitivity of the Ru dissolution to strain. Our findings show a strain-relieving pathway via surface reconstruction in RuO2(110) and provide an example of a strain-relieving mechanism that does not affect dissolution.</description>

                Abstract It is desirable but challenging to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) applications. In this work, a series of cerium oxide&#8208;coated cobalt vanadium oxide nanoplates (denoted as CVO@CeO 2 ) are prepared using different CeO 2 loadings through a facile two&#8208;step method. Compared to bare CVO, CeO 2, and commercial RuO 2 , the CVO@CeO 2 &#8208;0.20 catalyst presents much higher activity toward OER in alkaline solutions. Moreover, the CVO@CeO 2 &#8208;0.20 also exhibits superior open&#8208;circuit voltage and durability when utilized as the cathode in ZABs. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results disclose that the decoration of CeO 2 on CVO not only regulates the formation of high&#8208;spin state Co 3+ , optimizing the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) pathway, but also activates lattice oxygen, enhancing the lattice oxide oxidation mechanism (LOM) pathway. This research presents the CVO@CeO 2 heterojunction as an excellent catalyst for the OER and proposes a promising interface&#8208;regulated strategy for developing catalysts based on the reinforcement of AEM and LOM mechanisms.</description>

                Abstract In this study, we employ the pulsed laser defect engineering in liquid (PUDEL) to tailor the surface properties of cobalt (II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) platelets grown in the &lt; 111 &gt; direction. By varying the laser intensity and pulse number, we systematically investigate the relationship between defect formation and catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and selective oxidation of two alcohols. Our results reveal that the PUDEL processing leads to the formation of lattice distortions, the gradual alteration of three different paramagnetic defect sites, a partial reduction of Co 3 O 4 , and enrichment of the Co 3 O 4 (111) surface with hydroxyl groups (*OH), which significantly enhances OER activity. Theoretical investigations confirm that optimized hydroxyl coverage is critical for determining OER activity. The observed trends in selectivity and conversion efficiency for the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol (CA) and ethylene glycol (EG) suggest different reaction mechanisms. The activity trend of the selective oxidation of CA appears to follow the trend of a defect&#8208;attributed paramagnetic species that was assigned to a surface&#8208;near, distorted high&#8208;spin (S = 3/2) Co 2+ . In turn, the catalytic activity and OER activity trends for the EG oxidation showed similar trends, which followed the density of a paramagnetic CoO x species observed during EPR spectroscopy. In particular, the highest OER activity and EG conversion were both found for moderate (2 PPV, ), yet not too intense PUDEL processing. Our findings establish PUDEL as a precise method for catalyst optimization, both for thermal and electro&#8208;catalytic oxidation over defect&#8208;enriched cobalt oxides, which enables the correlation of specific laser&#8208;induced defects with catalytic activity trends.</description>

                Abstract Understanding electrochemical interfaces at the atomic level is essential for optimizing catalytic performance in energy conversion and storage technologies. This study introduces a computational framework based on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to predict the potential of maximum entropy (PME) a descriptor of electric double layer disorder and charge transfer efficiency. By integrating AIMD with the generalized computational hydrogen electrode, it is systematically investigated how electrolyte composition, cation identity, and pH effect the position of PME. The approach reproduces experimental shifts in PME for Au and Pt electrodes and provides unprecedented insights into the emergence of multiple PME values in mixed&#8208;cation systems. The findings challenge conventional models of electrolyte structuring by revealing the presence of multiple PME values within mixed&#8208;cation systems. This suggests a more complex interplay between cations, adsorbates, and interfacial disorder than previously assumed. The computational framework developed in this study provides a predictive tool for understanding these interactions, offering new strategies for tuning electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract The existence of Cl &#8722; in seawater electrolysis weakens the selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and causes material failure by chlorine pitting. Introducing anion layers not only repels the transition of Cl &#8722; without retarding the diffusion of oxygen&#8208;containing anions but also can be generated in situ on the outer surface. Here, a hierarchical catalyst consisting of a MnO 2 layer formed on a Ni foam substrate covered uniformly by a nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) active layer is developed through interfacial electrostatic engineering. It was found that the introduced Lewis acid layer (MnO 2 ) can spontaneously generate OH &#8722; groups on the outer surface in situ to repel Cl &#8722; by electrostatic repulsion force. Meanwhile, Ni&#8208;active sites anchored inside the MnO 2 matrix can improve the low activity of MnO 2 . The multilayer NiFe&#8208;LDH@MnO 2 /NF anode can operate steadily at the current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at 70 &#176;C for 100 h and maintain 97.9% OER selectivity. Furthermore, the OER overpotential was reduced by 136 mV, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial Ni mesh in industrial environments, especially the device can be powered by wind energy. The work offers an efficient strategy for designing high&#8208;performance seawater electrolysis with low cost and high stability.</description>

      <title>Powering the Future: A Cobalt&#8208;Based Catalyst for Longer&#8208;Lasting Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

                Abstract The development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) remain challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) at the cathode. In this context, a novel N&#8208;doped graphitic shell&#8208;encapsulated cobalt catalyst is presented as an air electrode with exceptional bifunctional activity, achieving an ORR half&#8208;wave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 0.81 V and an OER overpotential of 349 mV in an alkaline medium. The catalyst demonstrated excellent cycling durability and delivered superior power density in both liquid and solid&#8208;state ZABs. Furthermore, a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB is assembled with the catalyst, and it maintained a stable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.360 V for &gt;10 000 s. The catalyst achieved a peak power density of 127 mW cm &#8722;2 &#8212;significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C + RuO 2 system (74 mW cm &#8722;2 ). When two tandem&#8208;junction ZABs are connected in series, they achieved an OCV of 2.75 V and powering a &#8220;ZAB&#8221; LED strip and a mini fan. Furthermore, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the enhanced performance resulted from optimized binding energies between the Co@N(py) active sites and reaction intermediates. An in situ Raman study is carried out to understand the catalytic mechanism through transient intermediate detection.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bifunctional Electrocatalysts Through p&#8208;Block Metal Incorporation in Transition Metal Doped N&#8208;Graphene for Oxygen Evolution and Reduction Reactions</title>

                Abstract Development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for renewable energy storage and conversion technologies. While transition metal (TM) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;doped graphene systems (TM&#8208;N&#8208;G) are well&#8208;known for their electrocatalytic performance, their bifunctional activity for both OER and ORR remains limited and inefficient. In this work, bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of TM&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G systems (TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) is investigated by incorporating p&#8208;block metals (PM = Al, Ga, In, Sn, and Bi) into an N 4 cavity, resulting in TM&#8208;PM&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G structures. Systematic DFT calculations reveal that among all the system configurations, Co&#8208;Ga&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G and Co&#8208;Sn&#8208;N 6 &#8208;G emerge as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts. The enhanced catalytic activity of Co centres is attributed to optimal interactions with reaction intermediates, as elucidated by scaling relations, volcano plots, and contour maps. These optimal interactions are explained by changes in electronic structure of catalysts and charge redistribution at the TM sites, induced by incorporated PMs. A new descriptor &#978; is proposed to describe the catalytic activity, performing better than conventional d&#8208;band center. Additionally, several unifunctional catalysts are identified. This detailed analysis provides key insights and design strategies for developing high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts via PM doping in TM&#8208;N&#8208;G systems.</description>

      <title>Graph neural networks for predicting metal&#8211;ligand coordination of transition metal complexes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415658122</link>
      <description>Jacob Toney, R. Michel, Aaron Garrison, Ilia Kevlishvili, Heather J. Kulik, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 122(41)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414857994

                High-throughput virtual screening campaigns are invaluable for surveying the combinatorial space of possible transition metal complexes (TMCs), but they rely on accurate metal&#8211;ligand connectivity for meaningful results. Here, we curate a dataset of 70,069 unique ligands of known coordination from experimental structures of TMCs deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using this dataset, we train separate graph neural network models to predict the total number and individual identities of ligand coordinating atoms with high accuracy and precision. Interpreting each model in terms of the learned molecular representations uncovers trends aligned with our understanding of coordination chemistry as well as chemical insights. Next, we integrate the trained models with the high-throughput screening software molSimplify and illustrate their utility by generating 1,175 TMCs and validating their geometries with density functional theory calculations. We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.</description>
