      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq4696</link>
      <description>J. W. Zhao, Yunxiang Li, Deyan Luan, Xiong Wen Lou, Science Advances. 10(39)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402831200

                Electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in driving the progress of modern technologies and industrial processes such as energy conversion and emission reduction. Perovskite oxides, an important family of electrocatalysts, have garnered substantial attention in diverse catalytic reactions because of their highly tunable composition and structure, as well as their considerable activity and stability. This review delves into the mechanisms of electrocatalytic reactions that use perovskite oxides as electrocatalysts, while also providing a comprehensive summary of the potential key factors that influence catalytic activity across various reactions. Furthermore, this review offers an overview of advanced characterizations used for studying catalytic mechanisms and proposes approaches to designing highly efficient perovskite oxide electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity Driven by the Synergy Between Surface Vacancies and Cocatalysts: Surface Reaction Matters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202407092</link>
      <description>Wenhui Yue, Ziwei Ye, Cong Liu, Zehong Xu, Lingzhi Wang, Xiaoming Cao, Hiromi Yamashita, Jinlong Zhang, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402841200

                Abstract The incorporation of defects and cocatalysts is known to be effective in improving photocatalytic activity, yet their coupled contribution to the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process has not been well&#8208;explored. In this study, We demonstrate that the incorporation of S vacancies and NiSe can contribute to the improvement of charge separation efficiency via the formation of a strong electric field within the bulk ZnIn 2 S 4 (ZIS) and on its surface. More importantly, We also demonstrate that the synergy of S vacancies and NiSe benefits the overall hydrogen evolution activity by facilitating the H 2 O adsorption and dissociation process. This is particularly important for hydrogen evolution taking place under alkaline conditions where the proton concentration is low, allowing ZISv&#8208;NiSe (containing abundant S vacancies) to outperform ZIS&#8208;NiSe under alkaline conditions. In contrast, under acid conditions, since there are already sufficient amounts of protons available for reaction, the hydrogen evolution activity became governed by the hydrogen adsorption/desorption process rather than the H 2 O dissociation process. This leads to ZIS&#8208;NiSe exhibiting higher activity than ZISv&#8208;NiSe due to its more favorable hydrogen adsorption energy. The findings thus provide insights into how defect and cocatalyst modification strategies can be tailor&#8208;made to improve hydrogen evolution activity under different pH conditions.</description>

      <title>GraphBNC: Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Prediction of Interactions Between Metal Nanoclusters and Blood Proteins</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202407046</link>

                Abstract Hybrid nanostructures between biomolecules and inorganic nanomaterials constitute a largely unexplored field of research, with the potential for novel applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Developing such applications relies critically on understanding the dynamical properties of the nano&#8211;bio interface. This work introduces and validates a strategy to predict atom&#8208;scale interactions between water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and a set of blood proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, and fibrinogen). Graph theory and neural networks are utilized to predict the strengths of interactions in AuNC&#8211;protein complexes on a coarse&#8208;grained level, which are then optimized in Monte Carlo&#8208;based structure search and refined to atomic&#8208;scale structures. The training data is based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AuNC&#8211;protein complexes, and the validating MD simulations show the robustness of the predictions. This strategy can be generalized to any complexes of inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules provided that one generates enough data about the interactions, and the bioactive parts of the nanostructure can be coarse&#8208;grained rationally.</description>

      <title>Dual-Functional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Freestanding Aerogel Boosts Sulfur Reduction Reaction for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c11244</link>

                Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) technology stands out as a promising energy storage system. However, its journey toward practical implementation is hindered by sluggish sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) kinetics. A free-standing graphene aerogel (GA) combined with a copper-based metal-organic framework (MOF-GA) is fabricated as the sulfur host material for Li-S battery cathodes. The presence of MOF particles assumes a dual role, demonstrating its efficacy not only as a catalyst for the reduction reaction of graphene oxide (GO) but also as an electrochemical catalyst to promote sluggish SRR kinetics. The former amplifies electron transfer kinetics within the electrode, and the latter elevates the overall cell performance. Experimental results and theoretical calculations have proven the catalytic activity of MOF-GA electrodes, leading to a higher sulfur utilization of over 80% and a lower capacity decay of 0.082% per cycle. Under extreme conditions, the Li-S cells show a high initial specific capacity of 1113.0 mAh&#183;g</description>

      <title>Nutmeg and SPICE: Models and Data for Biomolecular Machine Learning</title>

                We describe version 2 of the SPICE data set, a collection of quantum chemistry calculations for training machine learning potentials. It expands on the original data set by adding much more sampling of chemical space and more data on noncovalent interactions. We train a set of potential energy functions called Nutmeg on it. They are based on the TensorNet architecture. They use a novel mechanism to improve performance on charged and polar molecules, injecting precomputed partial charges into the model to provide a reference for the large-scale charge distribution. Evaluation of the new models shows that they do an excellent job of reproducing energy differences between conformations even on highly charged molecules or ones that are significantly larger than the molecules in the training set. They also produce stable molecular dynamics trajectories and are fast enough to be useful for routine simulation of small molecules.</description>

                Abstract Synergistic Pd&#8211;In 2 O 3 catalysts are promising candidates for producing methanol via CO 2 hydrogenation, and the metal phases in them can be tuned by thermal reduction treatment affecting the catalytic activity significantly. This work presents a comprehensive investigation to gain an insight into the effect of thermal reduction temperature on the variation and interaction of Pd and In 2 O 3 phases supported on CeO 2 (viz., PdIn/CeO 2 ) and their correlations with CO 2 hydrogenation toward methanol synthesis. The findings show that Pd/In&#8208;rich PdIn alloys and In 2 O 3 with relatively strong interaction are key phases (by reducing the PdIn/CeO 2 at 300&#176;C) for promoting methanol formation, leading to a high selectivity to methanol at 78.9% and space&#8211;time yield (STY) of 3.6 g CH3OH g PdIn &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 . A further increase in reduction temperature (from 300 to 500&#176;C) promoted the formation of homogenized PdIn intermetallic alloys with significantly poor ability for H 2 dissociation and CO 2 activation, and hence poor methanol yield.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Adsorption Ability of Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065 and Diaion&#8482; CR20 Ion Exchangers for Heavy Metals with Particular Consideration of Palladium(II) and Copper(II)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29184386</link>
      <description>Anna Wo&#322;owicz, Zbigniew Hubicki, Molecules. 29(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402856031

                The adsorption capacities of ion exchangers with the primary amine (Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065) and polyamine (Diaion&#8482; CR20) functional groups relative to Pd(II) and Cu(II) ions were tested in a batch system, taking into account the influence of the acid concentration (HCl: 0.1&#8211;6 mol/L; HCl-HNO3: 0.9&#8211;0.1 mol/L HCl&#8212;0.1&#8211;0.9 mol/L HNO3), phase contact time (1&#8211;240 min), initial concentration (10&#8211;1000 mg/L), agitation speed (120&#8211;180 rpm), bead size (0.385&#8211;1.2 mm), and temperature (293&#8211;333 K), as well as in a column system where the variable operating parameters were HCl and HNO3 concentrations. There were used the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intraparticle diffusion models to describe the kinetic studies and the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models to describe the equilibrium data to obtain better knowledge about the adsorption mechanism. The physicochemical properties of the ion exchangers were characterized by the nitrogen adsorption/desorption analyses, CHNS analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the sieve analysis, and points of zero charge measurements. As it was found, Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065 exhibited a better ability to remove Pd(II) than Diaion&#8482; CR20, and the adsorption ability series for heavy metals was as follows: Pd(II) &gt;&gt; Zn(II) &#8776; Ni(II) &gt;&gt; Cu(II). The optimal experimental conditions for Pd(II) sorption were 0.1 mol/L HCl, agitation speed 180 rpm, temperature 293 K, and bead size fraction 0.43 mm &#8804; f3 &lt; 0.6 mm for Diaion&#8482; CR20 and 0.315&#8211;1.25 mm for Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065. The maximum adsorption capacities were 289.68 mg/g for Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065 and 208.20 mg/g for Diaion&#8482; CR20. The greatest adsorption ability of Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065 for Pd(II) was also demonstrated in the column studies. The working ion exchange in the 0.1 mol/L HCl system was 0.1050 g/mL, much higher compared to Diaion&#8482; CR20 (0.0545 g/mL). The best desorption yields of %D1 = 23.77% for Diaion&#8482; CR20 and 33.57% for Lewatit&#174; VP OC 1065 were obtained using the 2 mol/L NH3&#183;H2O solution.</description>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising materials for electrochemical energy applications due to their excellent catalytic performance and durability. However, the controlled synthesis of HEAs with a well-defined structure and a uniform composition distribution remains a challenge. Herein, a soft template-assisted electrodeposition technique is used to fabricate a mesoporous HEA (m-HEA) film with a uniform composition distribution of Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, and Cu, providing a suitable platform for investigating structure-performance relationships. Electrochemical deposition enables the uniform nucleation and grain growth of m-HEA, which can be deposited onto many conductive substrates. The m-HEA film exhibits an enhanced mass activity of 4.2 A mg</description>

                Abstract The strategic manipulation of the interaction between a central metal atom and its coordinating environment in single-atom catalysts (SACs) is crucial for catalyzing the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, it remains a major challenge. While density-functional theory calculations serve as a powerful tool for catalyst screening, their time-consuming nature poses limitations. This paper presents a machine learning (ML) model based on easily accessible intrinsic descriptors to enable rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput screening of efficient SACs in complex systems. Our ML model comprehensively captures the influences of interactions between 3 and 5d metal centers and 8 C, N-based coordination environments on CO 2 RR activity and selectivity. We reveal the electronic origin of the different activity trends observed in early and late transition metals during coordination with N atoms. The extreme gradient boosting regression model shows optimal performance in predicting binding energy and limiting potential for both HCOOH and CO production. We confirm that the product of the electronegativity and the valence electron number of metals, the radius of metals, and the average electronegativity of neighboring coordination atoms are the critical intrinsic factors determining CO 2 RR activity. Our developed ML models successfully predict several high-performance SACs beyond the existing database, demonstrating their potential applicability to other systems. This work provides insights into the low-cost and rational design of high-performance SACs.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal oxides are state-of-the-art materials for catalysing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose slow kinetics currently limit the efficiency of water electrolysis. However, microscale physicochemical heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover concurrent bias-dependent pathways for the OER in a dense, crystalline electrocatalyst, &#945;-Li 2 IrO 3 . By spatially and temporally tracking changes in stretching modes we follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange under various electrolytes and cycling conditions, comparing our observations with other crystalline catalysts (IrO 2 , LiCoO 2 ). We demonstrate that at low overpotentials the reaction between water and the oxidized catalyst surface is compensated by bulk ion exchange, as usually only found for amorphous, electrolyte permeable, catalysts. At high overpotentials the charge is compensated by surface redox active sites, as in other crystalline catalysts such as IrO 2 . Hence, our work reveals charge compensation can extend beyond the surface in crystalline catalysts. More generally, the results highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for chemically specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in catalysts, battery materials, or memristors.</description>

      <title>A Constraint-Based Orbital-Optimized Excited State Method (COOX)</title>

                In this work, we present a novel method to directly calculate targeted electronic excited states within a self-consistent field calculation based on constrained density functional theory (cDFT). The constraint is constructed from the static occupied-occupied and virtual-virtual parts of the excited state difference density from (simplified) linear-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations (LR-TDDFT). Our new method shows a stable convergence behavior, provides an accurate excited state density adhering to the Aufbau principle, and can be solved within a restricted SCF for singlet excitations to avoid spin contamination. This also allows the straightforward application of post-SCF electron-correlation methods like MP2 or direct RPA methods. We present the details of our constraint-based orbital-optimized excited state method (COOX) and compare it to similar schemes. The accuracy of excitation energies will be analyzed for a benchmark of systems, while the quality of the resulting excited state densities is investigated by evaluating excited state nuclear forces and excited state structure optimizations. We also investigate the performance of the proposed COOX method for long-range charge transfer excitations and conical intersections with the ground-state.</description>

                TiO2 has excellent photoelectrochemical properties, which makes its suitable for photoanode applications. TiO2 is widely utilized as semiconductor for dye-sensitized photoanode owing to its excellent stability and availability. The brookite polymorph of TiO2 has been suggested to demonstrate better photocatalytic properties. In this work, we studied the adsorption of polyenediphenyl-aniline dyes on (TiO2) n = 8, 68 brookite clusters using density functional theory (DFT). We report our results on the UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectra of the dyes and dyes adsorbed on TiO2 clusters, adsorption energies of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 clusters, electronic density of states and projected electronic density of states of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 complex, and electron density of the main molecular orbitals involved in photoexcitation for dye-sensitized solar cells application. The calculated adsorption energies of D5@(TiO2)68, D7@(TiO2)68, D9@(TiO2)68, and D11@(TiO2)68 are 4.84, 4.78, 4.66 and 4.92 eV, respectively. The results of the adsorption energies are in the order D11@(TiO2)8 &gt; D9@(TiO2)8 &gt; D7@(TiO2)8 &gt; D5@(TiO2)8 and D11@ (TiO2)68 &gt; D5@ (TiO2)68 &gt; D7@ (TiO2)68 &gt; D9@ (TiO2)68. This implies that D11 dye molecule reacts more strongly with (TiO2)8 and (TiO2)68 brookite clusters than the other corresponding dye molecules.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis, as the pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, sets off a worldwide research boom in full swing, while its large kinetic obstacles require remarkable catalysts to break through. Here, based on summarizing reaction mechanisms and in situ characterizations, the structure&#8211;activity relationships of oxygen electrocatalysts are emphatically overviewed, including the influence of geometric morphology and chemical structures on the electrocatalytic performances. Subsequently, experimental/theoretical research is combined with device applications to comprehensively summarize the cutting&#8208;edge oxygen electrocatalysts according to various material categories. Finally, future challenges are forecasted from the perspective of catalyst development and device applications, favoring researchers to promote the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis at an early date.</description>

                Abstract MXenes doped with non&#8208;metallic and transition metal elements exhibit remarkable potential as catalysts in the hydrogen energy. Nonetheless, efficiently identifying viable materials from a vast array of candidates remains a formidable challenge. Here, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the hydrogen adsorption free energy () of 78 types of doped TiVCO 2 MXene catalysts. Then we employed machine learning models to categorize the values of the 78 catalysts, resulted in an accurate model which only uses 7 readily available elemental features but has an impressive accuracy of 93.6%. Our model successfully predicting 5 TiVCO 2 catalysts doped with S with superior performance, subsequently validated through DFT calculations. This classification methodology not only evaluates the range of effectively but also facilitates qualitative prediction and screening of catalysts, presenting a novel approach for catalytic systems with limited available data.</description>

      <title>Regulating Fe Intermediate Spin States via FeN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Cl&#8208;Ti Structure for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>

                Abstract Modulating the spin states of FeN 4 moieties is critical for enhancing the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, Ti 4 N 3 Cl x and Ti 4 N 3 O x MXenes are synthesized and functionalized with iron phthalocyanine (FePc) to form model catalysts with well&#8208;defined FeN 4 &#8208;Cl&#8208;Ti and FeN 4 &#8208;O&#8208;Ti structures, respectively. The FeN 4 &#8208;Cl&#8208;Ti structure, formed within the Ti 4 N 3 Cl x /FePc composite, enables precise modulation of FeN 4 spin states from low to intermediate spin, significantly enhancing ORR performance. In contrast, the FeN 4 &#8208;O&#8208;Ti structure in Ti 4 N 3 O x /FePc shows less effective spin state modulation, leading to comparatively lower ORR activity. Compared to FePc and Ti 4 N 3 O x /FePc, Ti 4 N 3 Cl x /FePc demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, with an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of +0.91 V versus RHE and doubled power densities in Zn&#8211;air batteries (214.5 mW cm &#8722;2 ). Theoretical studies confirm that the intermediate spin states induced by the weak&#8208;field ligand&#8208;modified FeN 4 &#8208;Cl&#8208;Ti structure in Ti 4 N 3 Cl x /FePc facilitate electron filling in the antibonding orbital composed of Fe 3dz 2 and O 2 &#960;* orbitals, greatly enhancing O&#8322; activation and ORR activity. These findings underscore the superior catalytic properties of FeN 4 &#8208;Cl&#8208;Ti compared to FeN 4 &#8208;O&#8208;Ti, advancing the understanding of spin state&#8208;related catalytic mechanisms and guiding the design of high&#8208;performance ORR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Topological Synthesis of 2D High&#8208;Entropy Multimetallic (Oxy)hydroxide for Enhanced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202409530</link>

                Abstract Owing to sluggish reaction kinetics and high potential, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. Herein, an innovative topological strategy is presented for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high&#8208;entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca&#8208;rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor, which possesses inherent structural flexibility enabling tailored elemental adjustments and topologically transforms from a point&#8208;shared structure of metal&#8208;oxygen octahedrons into an edge&#8208;shared structure under alkaline conditions. The presence of Zn in the catalysts causes a shift in the center of the O2p band toward the Fermi level, resulting in more Co 4+ species, which drive holes into oxygen ligands to promote intramolecular oxygen coupling. The triggered lattice oxidation mechanism is identified by detecting peroxo&#8208;like (O 2 2&#8722; ) negative species using tetramethylammonium chemical probe, along with 18 O isotope labeling experiments. As a result, the catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 267 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , ranking it among the top&#8208;performing non&#8208;Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Importantly, the catalysts also show high Fe&#8208;leaching resistance during OER compared to conventional NiFe and CoFe hydroxides/(oxy)hydroxides. The assembled zinc&#8208;air battery enables stable operation for over 225 h at a low charging voltage of 1.93 V.</description>

      <description>Huarui Xie, Jianjun Fu, &#1041;&#1086; &#1051;&#1102;, Jing Wang, Pei Kang Shen, Zhi Qun Tian, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402883959

                Abstract Developing metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts is critical to achieve the electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e &#8722; ORR) using seawater as electrolyte. Herein, N&#8208;rich doped carbon (NC) is synthesized by directly pyrolyzing guanine as both N and C sources, which can facilitate the formation of ultrahigh&#8208;N dopant (up to 33.89 at.%), and their ratios. The NC obtained at 700 &#176;C with hydrogenated pyridine&#8208;N and pyrrole&#8208;N (3:2) dopants exhibits a superior selectivity of H 2 O 2 (up to 96%), high mass activity of 545.5 A g &#8722;1 at 0.2 V versus RHE and stable production of H 2 O 2 with 16.8 in 0.5 M NaCl. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectrum analysis proves that hydrogenated pyridine&#8208;N and pyrrole&#8208;N dopants play a critical role in constructing metal&#8208;free active sites for the synthesis of H 2 O 2 . Meanwhile, theoretical calculations further reveal that compared to non&#8208;hydrogenated N dopants, hydrogenated pyridine and pyrrole N can tune the projected density of states of 2p z orbitals of their adjacent carbon atoms approaching Fermi Level, enhancing * OOH to H 2 O 2 through 2e &#8722; ORR rather than H 2 O via 4e &#8722; ORR. This work provides new insights for developing metal&#8208;free catalysts for efficient electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 using seawater resources as promising electrolytes.</description>
