      <title>Toward improved descriptors by refining the complex reaction network in electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0255158</link>
      <description>Lu Han, Huan Li, Jun Long, Hao Li, Jianping Xiao, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(13)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409038379

                Electrocatalysis is one of the key technologies for developing sustainable and fossil resource free routes to produce fuels and chemicals. The limiting potential (UL), defined by the reaction free energy of the most difficult electrochemical step in a given pathway, is an effective descriptor for establishing the activity trend of a set of electrocatalysts, allowing high throughput screening of new catalysts. However, the reaction network of electrocatalytic processes is rather complex, especially for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps, e.g., the synthesis of valuable C&#8211;N bond-containing chemicals. Thermochemical steps cannot be significantly enhanced by electrode potentials, where kinetics is a non-negligible issue at even high overpotentials. This makes it challenge by using limiting potential to accurately describe activity trends for the reactions with necessary thermochemical steps. To this end, we propose an effective scheme to determine an improved descriptor. We suggest refining the rather complex reaction network at first. In particular, it is suggested to decouple electro- and thermochemical steps and exclude the unfavorable pathways with an excessively high thermochemical barrier. Then, a global comparison among the other pathways can be made, to determine the optimal pathway and the improved descriptor (the reaction free energy of the most difficult step of the optimal pathway, defined as &#916;GrRPD-limiting). In addition, the studies on reaction kinetics are also suggested to understand the exception of the best catalysts and provide the direction of experimental optimization. This scheme is of a great compromise between practical efficiency and the accuracy toward the rational design of electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Surface strain hampers dissociation and induces curious rotational-alignment effect for HCl on the Au/Cu(111) alloy surface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0260125</link>
      <description>Tianhui Liu, Bina Fu, Dong H. Zhang, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(13)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409038844

                We present the first six-dimensional quantum dynamics study of HCl on a strained pseudomorphic monolayer of Au deposited on a Cu(111) substrate, utilizing a newly developed machine learning-based potential energy surface. The strain in the surface lattice, resulting from a 12.62% compression of the Au monolayer, induces a significant high barrier height (1.81 eV) and a tight saddle point. These effects lead to a marked suppression of the reactivity of ground-state HCl (v = 0) on Au/Cu(111), while the dissociation probability of vibrationally excited (v = 1) HCl increases substantially. As a result, the vibrational efficiency is notably higher compared to those for HCl on pure Au(111) and alloyed Au/Ag(111) surfaces. In addition, the surface strain induces a distinctive rotational alignment effect in the title reaction, where for HCl in the (v = 0, j) states, dissociation is most favorable when an HCl molecule collides with its rotation perpendicular to the Au/Cu(111) surface (the cartwheel alignment). In contrast, for HCl in the (v = 1, j) states, the opposite (helicopter) alignment is preferred. This leads to a pronounced difference in the effects of rotational excitation, depending on whether HCl is initially in the ground or excited vibrational state.</description>

      <title>Porous Antimony Tin Oxide with a Particle Assembly Structure as an IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Support for an Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c00875</link>

                Proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) holds great promise for hydrogen production applications. However, the reliance of PEMWE membrane electrodes on high loadings of expensive iridium poses a significant barrier to their commercial viability. Therefore, the development of high-performance oxygen evolution catalysts with a low iridium content is of critical importance. In this research, a porous antimony tin oxide (ATO) conductive support with a particle assembly aggregate structure was fabricated by a carbon template removal method. ATO-supported IrO2 exhibits significantly improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a much lower overpotential compared to the unsupported IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, it achieves 1.8 V at 2 A cm-2 with an ultralow loading of iridium (0.3 mgIr cm-2) for the proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer. Characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations have elucidated that the enhanced performance is attributed to the porous morphology of ATO and the strong metal oxide-support interaction between IrO2 and the ATO support. These findings validate the practicality of conductive nanostructured antimony-tin-oxide-supported catalysts for PEMWE applications and offer a pathway for the design of low-Ir OER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective precious metal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is key to realizing the economic viability of acidic water electrolysis. Herein, galvanic displacement is employed for in situ formation of bimetallic Pt/Ru deposits on H&#8208;intercalated TiO 2 nanotube arrays. It is found that a two&#8208;step procedure yields polydisperse deposits with a dominant fraction of Ru nanoparticles coated with atomic and subnanometric Pt islands. These Pt|Ru nanointerfaces induce charge transfer from Pt to Ru, which modulates the electronic structure of Pt sites for accelerated HER kinetics. By varying the platinization time in the second step, a balance between the exposure of catalytically active Pt|Ru nanointerfaces and the total number of Pt surface sites is achieved. The optimized composite, termed Ru&#8208;30min@Pt&#8208;30min, requires an overpotential of 58 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1.0 m HClO 4 and maintains performance stability and structure integrity under prolonged operation. Moreover, it presents a 3.5&#8208;fold increase in precious metal mass activity over Pt/C at &#951; = 80 mV. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronic interactions generated by Pt&#8208;modification of Ru and hydrogenated TiO 2 surfaces provide multiple active sites with improved H ads energetics compared to pure Pt and Ru.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Rich Selenide Monolayers as Metal-Free Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reactions: A First-Principles Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7020055</link>
      <description>Yao Xu, Fengyu Li, Chemistry. 7(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409092115

                Carbon-based materials have garnered significant attention for electrocatalysis applications in fuel cells due to their unique structural and electronic properties, but rapid oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode of fuel cells is challenging. Dopants are typically used as active sites for ORR, and increasing the number of active sites for carbon-based catalysts remains a challenge. Here, we carried out first-principles calculations for the electrocatalytic ORR performance of the recently reported monolayer superconductors of carbon-rich selenides. Remarkably, the abundant C atoms serve as the active centers instead of the foreign atoms (Se). All the free energy changes during the ORR process are downhill, suggesting that these carbon-rich selenides hold promise as metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR. Note that the promising electrocatalytic performance of carbon-rich selenides is theoretically predicted; validation is encouraged for experimental efforts.</description>

      <title>Explainable classification of goat vocalizations using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318543</link>
      <description>Stavros Ntalampiras, Gabriele Pesando Gamacchio, PLoS ONE. 20(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409049727

                Efficient precision livestock farming relies on having timely access to data and information that accurately describes both the animals and their surrounding environment. This paper advances classification of goat vocalizations leveraging a publicly available dataset recorded at diverse farms breeding different species. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for classifying goat vocalizations, yielding an average classification rate of 95.8% in discriminating various goat emotional states. To this end, we suitably augmented the existing dataset using pitch shifting and time stretching techniques boosting the robustness of the trained model. After thoroughly demonstrating the superiority of the designed architecture over the contrasting approaches, we provide insights into the underlying mechanisms governing the proposed CNN by carrying out an extensive interpretation study. More specifically, we conducted an explainability analysis to identify the time-frequency content within goat vocalisations that significantly impacts the classification process. Such an XAI-driven validation not only provides transparency in the decision-making process of the CNN model but also sheds light on the acoustic features crucial for distinguishing the considered classes. Last but not least, the proposed solution encompasses an interactive scheme able to provide valuable information to animal scientists regarding the analysis performed by the model highlighting the distinctive components of the considered goat vocalizations. Our findings underline the effectiveness of data augmentation techniques in bolstering classification accuracy and highlight the significance of leveraging XAI methodologies for validating and interpreting complex machine learning models applied to animal vocalizations.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Simulations of Skaergaardite (CuPd) with a Self-Consistent Hubbard U-Correction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7020056</link>
      <description>Martino Napoli, Assimo Maris, Chemistry. 7(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4409091991

                The electronic and phonon bands of Skaergaardite are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO. Skaergaardite is a copper palladium mineral (CuPd) found in the Skaergaard intrusion with a CsCl-type (B2) structure. Due to its porous structure, it presents a large surface area available for interactions, which makes it a promising catalyst. The PBE-GGA functional with a Hubbard-like localized term (DFT+U) is combined with ultrasoft and norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a conventional approach with a dense Monkhorst&#8211;Pack grid of k-points 12 &#215; 12 &#215; 12 is applied. The electronic valence bands are mainly constituted by 3d orbitals of Cu and 4d orbitals of Pd and a pseudo-gap can be recognized. With respect to DFT, DFT+U causes a general downward shift in the valence band. The acoustic and optical phonon branches are separated by a few cm&#8722;1 gap at about 150 cm&#8722;1 and show a density of state curve typical of ordered materials. These results highlight the reliability of DFT+U in studying bimetallic systems with scarce experimental benchmarks, offering insights into the behavior of Skaergaardite and its potential applications in material science such as reduction reactions and hydrogen storage.</description>
