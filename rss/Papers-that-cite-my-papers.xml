                Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and their derivatives have been widely applied as electrocatalysts owing to their unique nanoscale pore configurations, stable periodic structures, abundant coordination sites and high surface area. This work aims to construct a non-thermodynamically stable Pt-N 2 coordination active site by electrochemically modifying platinum (Pt) single atoms into a fully conjugated 2D COF as conductive agent-free and pyrolysis-free electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition to maximizing atomic utilization, single-atom catalysts with definite structures can be used to investigate catalytic mechanisms and structure-activity relationships. In this work, in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that a nitrogen-rich graphene analogue COF not only exhibits a favorable metal-support effect for Pt, adjusting the binding energy between Pt sites to H* intermediates by forming unique Pt-N 2 instead of the typical Pt-N 4 coordination environment, but also enhances electron transport ability and structural stability, showing both conductivity and stability in acidic environments.</description>

      <title>Assembled RhRuFe Trimetallene for Water Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Industrializing water electrolyzers demands better electrocatalysts, especially for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The prevailing OER catalysts are Ir or Ru&#8208;based nanomaterials, however, they still suffer from insufficient stability. An alternative yet considerably less explored approach is to upgrade Rh, a known stable but moderately active element for OER electrocatalysis, via rational structural engineering. Herein, a precise synthesis of assembled RhRuFe trimetallenes (RhRuFe TMs) with an average thickness of 1 nm for boosting overall water splitting catalysis is reported. Favorable mass transport and optimized electronic structure collectively render RhRuFe TMs with an improved OER activity of an overpotential of 330 mV to deliver 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is significantly lower than the Rh/C control (by 601 mV) and reported Rh&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. In particular, the RhRuFe TMs&#8208;based water splitting devices can achieve the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.63 V, which is among the best in the Rh&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts for electrolyzers. The addition of Fe in RhRuFe TMs can modulate the strain/electron distribution of the multi&#8208;alloy, which regulates the binding energies of H * and OH * in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions for achieving the enhanced bifunctional OER and HER catalysis is further demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Co&#9472;Mn Bimetallic Nanowires by Interfacial Modulation with/without Vacancy Filling as Active and Durable Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202400859</link>

                Abstract Active and stable nonnoble electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are required for water splitting by sustainable electricity. Here, Mn bonded with O and P is incorporated to modulate Co 3 S 4 and Co 2 P respectively to enhance the catalytic activity and extend the catalyst lifetime. Mn 3 O 4 adjusts the electronic structure of Co 3 S 4 and Co atom fills the oxygen vacancy in Mn 3 O 4 . The interfacial interaction endows Co 3 S 4 /Mn 3 O 4 to a lower reaction barrier due to ideal binding energies for OER intermediates. Structure stability of active sites and enhanced Co&#9472;S bonds by Operando Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reduce the dissolution of Co 3 S 4 /Mn 3 O 4 , resulting in a lifetime of 500 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 for OER. The modulation of Co 2 P by MnP weakens the interaction between Co sites and adsorbed H * , achieving a high activity under a large current for HER. The assembled electrolyzer affords 50 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.58 V and exhibits a lifetime of 350 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 . The calculations disclose the electron interaction for the activity and stability, as well as the enhanced conductivity. The findings develop new avenues toward promoting catalytic activity and stability, making Co&#9472;Mn bimetallic nanowires efficient electrocatalysts for nonnoble water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Concurrent learning scheme for crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.109.094117</link>
      <description>Z. J. Wang, Xiao-Yang Wang, Xiaoshan Luo, Pengyue Gao, Yanfeng Sun, Jian Lv, Han Wang, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma, Physical review. 109(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393094535

                Crystal structure prediction (CSP) and machine learning potential (MLP) are two fundamental methods for modern computational material discovery. While the former aims at efficient sampling of the potential energy surface (PES) for discovering new materials, the latter focuses on reproducing the PES to accelerate various atomic simulation tasks. In this work, we combine the two methods within a concurrent learning framework in an effort to generate efficient MLP models for accelerating CSP. The proposed scheme explores the PES through the swarm-intelligence calypso method, labels the most representative structures with quantum mechanical calculations, and learns the PES through a deep potential (DP) model. The process proceeds in an iterative, computationally efficient, and automated manner, leading to the collection of a most compact reference training set from which the resulting DP model is proven particularly suitable for accelerating calypso structure prediction. The scheme has been systematically benchmarked on binary magnesium-aluminium (Mg-Al) alloys and ternary lithium-lanthanum-hydrogen (Li-La-H) superhydrides, demonstrating its efficiency and reliability in DP model construction and calypso structure prediction. The proposed scheme represents a promising routine to perform the structure prediction of large or multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of direct Z-scheme GaS/WTe2 van der Waals heterostructure as photocatalyst for water splitting</title>

                The effective separation of charge carriers and the redox capacity for water splitting are two crucial factors that influence photocatalysis. Here, we studied the photocatalytic properties of GaS/WTe2 van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) using first-principle calculations. The results show that this heterostructure acts as a direct Z-scheme with GaS as the water oxidation photocatalyst and WTe2 as the water reduction photocatalyst. Photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently separated, with electrons in GaS combining with holes in WTe2, while other charge carriers with high redox ability remain in the respective materials for water splitting. More importantly, the heterostructure exhibits excellent performance in all acid and alkali solutions (pH 0&#8211;14) and has strong light absorption in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible region. The power conversion efficiency(PCE) reaches 19.73%. This work reveals that GaS/WTe2 heterostructure is a highly promising material for photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Mastering the Lattice Strain in Bismuth&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Conversion</title>

                Abstract Tuning the lattice strain of catalysts represents a powerful strategy to alter their electronic structures and ultimately regulate catalytic performance. Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction is a promising avenue to accomplish the carbon&#8208;neutral cycle, however, there still lacks a distinct and systematic understanding of the lattice strain effect in CO 2 electrochemical conversion. In this work, the influence of lattice strain on Bi (012) facets to formate production is studied. The pre&#8208;executed density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that lattice compression promotes the wrinkling of exposed Bi surface and increases the total density of state (DOS) of active sites at the Fermi level. As the gradual intensification of lattice contraction, the selectivity of CO 2 reduction exhibits a volcanic alteration, with an optimal lattice contraction of 3%. Experimentally synthesized Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 /Bi heterogeneous catalyst confirms the effect of lattice compression. When compression reaches &#8722;3.04% on Bi (012) facets, the catalyst possesses the highest Faraday efficiency (FE) of 96.17% at &#8722;1.2 V RHE and an industrially scalable current density of &#8722;600 mA cm &#8722;2 . Additionally, in seawater&#8208;based electrolysis, the catalyst also exhibits excellent remarkable FE of 95.43% of formate production.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the synergistic effect of amorphous CoW-phospho-borides for overall alkaline water electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.090</link>
      <description>Aniruddha Bhide, Suraj Gupta, Rinkoo Bhabal, Kishan H. Mali, B.R. Bhagat, Alpa Dashora, Maulik Patel, R. Fernandes, N. Patel, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 63(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393137824

                Amorphous transition-metal-phospho-borides (TMPBs) are emerging as a new class of hybrid bifunctional catalysts for water-splitting. The present work reports the discovery of CoWPB as a new promising material that adds to the smaller family of TMPBs. The optimized compositions, namely Co4WPB5 and Co2WPB1 could achieve 10 mA/cm2 at just 72 mV and 262 mV of overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the catalyst showed good performance in a 2-electrode assembly (1.59 V for 10 mA/cm2) with considerable stability (70 h stability, 10,000 operating cycles). Detailed morphological and electrochemical characterizations unveiled insights into the role of all elements in catalyst's improved performance. The presence of W was found to be crucial in improving the electronic conductivity and charge redistribution, making CoWPB suitable for both HER and OER. In computational simulation analysis, two configurations with different atomic environments, namely, CoWPBH and CoWPBO were found to have the lowest calculated overpotentials for HER and OER, respectively. It was found that the surface P-sites in CoWPBH were HER-active while the Co-sites in CoWPBO were OER-active sites. The study presents new knowledge about active sites in such multi-component catalysts that will foster more advancement in the area of water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Investigation of Ammonia Oxidation on the M-Doped &#946;-Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Fe) Surfaces</title>

                The ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) has applications as a sustainable energy source and in wastewater remediation. Nickel based catalysts for the AOR reaction are ideal as they are cost efficient, have longer lifetimes than more expensive alternatives, and can produce value-added products. Dopants can be applied to these nickel catalysts to further increase their value. This work explores the effects on reaction potentials when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 is doped with chromium, cobalt, copper, or iron using density functional theory to model the AOR. Limiting potentials for dinitrogen production improved when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 was doped with chromium and cobalt. Limiting potentials for nitrite production remained consistent when &#946;-Ni(OH)2 was doped with cobalt or iron. Compared with the pristine &#946;-Ni(OH)2 surface, there was no improvement in the limiting potential of nitrate formation for any of the doped surfaces. This research begins to reveal the importance of exploring dopant addition to &#946;-Ni(OH)2 as a method of improving the catalyst activity for the AOR.</description>

      <title>Toward transferable empirical valence bonds: Making classical force fields reactive</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0196952</link>
      <description>Alice Allen, G&#225;bor C&#347;anyi, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393152642

                The empirical valence bond technique allows classical force fields to model reactive processes. However, parametrization from experimental data or quantum mechanical calculations is required for each reaction present in the simulation. We show that the parameters present in the empirical valence bond method can be predicted using a neural network model and the SMILES strings describing a reaction. This removes the need for quantum calculations in the parametrization of the empirical valence bond technique. In doing so, we have taken the first steps toward defining a new procedure for enabling reactive atomistic simulations. This procedure would allow researchers to use existing classical force fields for reactive simulations, without performing additional quantum mechanical calculations.</description>

      <title>Role of Electrolyte pH on Water Oxidation for Iridium Oxides</title>

                Understanding the effect of noncovalent interactions of intermediates at the polarized catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface on water oxidation kinetics is key for designing more active and stable electrocatalysts. Here, we combine operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) to probe the effect of noncovalent interactions on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Our results suggest that the active species for the OER (Ir4.x+&#8211;*O) binds much stronger in alkaline compared with acid at low coverage, while the repulsive interactions between these species are higher in alkaline electrolytes. These differences are attributed to the larger fraction of water within the cation hydration shell at the interface in alkaline electrolytes compared to acidic electrolytes, which can stabilize oxygenated intermediates and facilitate long-range interactions between them. Quantitative analysis of the state energetics shows that although the *O intermediates bind more strongly than optimal in alkaline electrolytes, the larger repulsive interaction between them results in a significant weakening of *O binding with increasing coverage, leading to similar energetics of active states in acid and alkaline at OER-relevant potentials. By directly probing the electrochemical interface with complementary spectroscopic techniques, our work goes beyond conventional computational descriptors of the OER activity to explain the experimentally observed OER kinetics of IrOx in acidic and alkaline electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Advancing Sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion Processes: Trinomial Technology, Environment, and Economy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07133</link>

                CO2 can be converted into value-added products such as fuels, chemicals, and building materials, adding an economic incentive for CO2 capture and green economy, while also reducing the environmental footprint of hard-to-abate industries such as aviation, construction, and metallurgy. Nonetheless, most available technologies for direct CO2 conversion, while promising, are still in early development stages, facing technical and economic challenges for their scale-up, questioning their viability to truly instill a timely impact on global CO2 emissions. Furthermore, a clear environmental benefit should be obtained for the new processes versus the traditional ones they are replacing in the market. In this perspective, we examine the range of available technologies for direct CO2 conversion using thermal, electrical, and photochemical routes and mineralization including the advancements in their role in synthesizing a range of resulting products from methanol, methane, carbon monoxide, and solid carbonates. We offer insights on the trends in current research and development and the required direction to expedite the technological readiness of attractive CO2 conversion technologies in terms of catalytic material and reactor design. We also highlight the important role of modeling (molecular and process levels) as an enabling tool to deploy these technologies at the commercial scale originating from understanding their behavior at the molecular level. Lastly, we highlight the significance of carrying out reliable life cycle analysis in identifying the environmental hotspots as well as gaps in the technology that allows improving their environmental footprint and economic attractiveness.</description>

      <title>Extending the definition of atomic basis sets to atoms with fractional nuclear charge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0196383</link>
      <description>Giorgio Domenichini, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393152656

                Alchemical transformations showed that perturbation theory can be applied also to changes in the atomic nuclear charges of a molecule. The alchemical path that connects two different chemical species involves the conceptualization of a non-physical system in which an atom possess a non-integer nuclear charge. A correct quantum mechanical treatment of these systems is limited by the fact that finite size atomic basis sets do not define exponents and contraction coefficients for fractional charge atoms. This paper proposes a solution to this problem and shows that a smooth interpolation of the atomic orbital coefficients and exponents across the periodic table is a convenient way to produce accurate alchemical predictions, even using small size basis sets.</description>

      <title>Surface structure determination by exhaustive search of asymmetric unit</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevb.109.115430</link>
      <description>Xingxing Dong, Caiyun He, Chao He, Hui Wang, Shaogang Xu, Hu Xu, Physical review. 109(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393157853

                Determining surface structures is a substantial challenge due to the limitations of experimental techniques and the complexity of theoretical models. In this work, we use a method called the exhaustive search of asymmetric unit (ESAU), designed to identify surface structures through a detailed analysis of the asymmetric unit. This method employs two main strategies: narrowing the research area by focusing on a smaller, unique segment rather than the entire unit cell, and transforming the infinite possibilities of atomic positions into discrete, manageable units. These strategies allow us to systematically enumerate all potential surface structures. Employing the ESAU method, we have successfully replicated a variety of known surface structures, including two-dimensional materials on substrates, and have also uncovered some previously unknown structures. Importantly, the ESAU method shows significant promise not only in utilizing experimental data but also in predicting surface and crystal structures without prior experimental evidence. Our results affirm that the ESAU approach provides a comprehensive and efficient tool for uncovering material structures, paving the way for more in-depth studies on the properties and behaviors of materials.</description>
