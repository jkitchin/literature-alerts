      <title>An All-Atom Force Field for Dry and Water-Lubricated Carbon Tribological Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c07471</link>
      <description>Thomas Reichenbach, Souleymane Sylla, Leonhard Mayrhofer, Pedro Romero, Paul Schwarz, Michael Moseler, Gianpietro Moras, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392578215

                We present a nonreactive force field for molecular dynamics simulations of interfaces between amorphous carbon surfaces and their interaction with water. The force field is tailored to surfaces with hydrogen, hydroxyl, and aromatic surface passivation and enables large-scale simulations of dry and lubricated tribological contacts. To favor its compatibility with existing force-field parameterizations for liquids and allow a straightforward extension to other types of surface passivation species, we adopt the functional form of the Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations. The optimization of the force-field parameters is systematic and follows a protocol that can be reused for other surface&#8211;molecule combinations. Reference data are calculated with gradient- and dispersion-corrected density functional theory and include the bonding geometry and elastic deformation of bulk and surface species as well as surface adhesion and water adsorption energy landscapes. The conventions adopted to define the different force-field atom types are based on the hybridization of carbon orbitals and enable a simple and efficient parameter optimization strategy that only requires quantum-mechanical simulations of crystalline reference structures. After testing the force field on amorphous interfaces, we present two examples of application to tribological problems. Namely, we investigate the relationships between dry friction and the corrugation of the contact potential energy surface and the dependency of friction on the thickness of interface water films. We finally discuss the limitations of the force field and propose strategies for its improvement and extension.</description>

                The development of a fully ab initio theory for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) materials is a prominent challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. Here, quantum-mechanical density functional theory calculations are used to discover the mechanisms underlying the nucleation and growth of monolayer 2H molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) during organometallic CVD. Starting with molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as molecular precursors, we elucidate processes such as the decomposition of Mo(CO)6 to Mo(CO)3, sulfidation of Mo(CO)3, formation of metallic trigonal-phase (1T) Mo&#8211;S clusters, transition to semiconducting hexagonal-phase 2H MoS2, and the competition between the growth of Mo- and S-zigzag edges that lead to triangular and hexagonal flakes. We demonstrate thermodynamic and kinetic control over the formation of Mo- and S-zigzag edges. Additionally, we find the removal of hydrogen (H2) to be the rate-determining step in the growth process. We further compute the free energy of formation of the investigated Mo&#8211;S clusters on amorphous SiO2, demonstrating the important role played by the SiO2 substrate in the initial stages of nucleation and growth. We also show the feasibility of forming Mo&#8211;S clusters with more than two Mo atoms on the SiO2 surface. Our work lays the foundation for developing fully ab initio models of 2D material synthesis.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Isotropic &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; Values of Radical Polymers</title>

                Methods for electronic structure computations, such as density functional theory (DFT), are routinely used for the calculation of spectroscopic parameters to establish and validate structure&#8211;parameter correlations. DFT calculations, however, are computationally expensive for large systems such as polymers. This work explores the machine learning (ML) of isotropic g values, giso, obtained from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments of an organic radical polymer. An ML model based on regression trees is trained on DFT-calculated g values of poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA) polymer structures extracted from different time frames of a molecular dynamics trajectory. The DFT-derived g values, gisocalc, for different radical densities of PTMA, are compared against experimentally derived g values obtained from in operando EPR measurements of a PTMA-based organic radical battery. The ML-predicted giso values, gisopred, were compared with gisocalc to evaluate the performance of the model. Mean deviations of gisopred from gisocalc were found to be on the order of 0.0001. Furthermore, a performance evaluation on test structures from a separate MD trajectory indicated that the model is sensitive to the radical density and efficiently learns to predict giso values even for radical densities that were not part of the training data set. Since our trained model can reproduce the changes in giso along the MD trajectory and is sensitive to the extent of equilibration of the polymer structure, it is a promising alternative to computationally more expensive DFT methods, particularly for large systems that cannot be easily represented by a smaller model system.</description>

                Here, we present a detailed computational study of the stability and the electronic structure of nitrogen-doped graphene (N4V2) supported Cun (n = 1&#8211;5) clusters, which are promising carbon-dioxide electroreduction catalysts. The binding of the clusters to the nitrogen-doped graphene and the electronic structure of these systems were investigated under vacuum and electrochemical conditions. The stability analysis showed that among the systems, the nitrogen-doped graphene bound Cu4 is the most stable in vacuum, while in an electrolyte, and at a negative potential, the N4V2&#8211;Cu3 is energetically more favorable. The ground state electronic structure of the nitrogen-doped graphene substrate undergoes topological phase transition, from a semimetallic state, and we observed a metallic and topologically trivial state after the clusters are deposited. The electrode potential adjusts the type and density of the charge carriers in the semimetallic models, while the structures containing copper exhibit bands which are deformed and relaxed by the modified number of electrons.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Insights on the Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation over Metal Oxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05307</link>
      <description>J. V. P. Long, Dong Luan, Xihong Fu, Huan Li, Huijuan Jing, Jianping Xiao, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392602509

                Electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (eN2OR) has emerged as a sustainable strategy for nitrogen fixation. In this work, density functional theory calculations were performed to rationalize the reaction mechanisms, activity, and selectivity of eN2OR on metal dioxides. The anatase (101), anatase (100), and rutile (110) surfaces were investigated to obtain more generalized insights. Based on the reaction phase diagram analysis, the thermochemical mechanisms were identified as most energetically favorable for N2 and *N2O oxidation, and a theoretical activity map was constructed for eN2OR, explaining well the experimental activity trend. Anatase PtO2(100) was screened as the most active catalyst for nitrate production, which could be covered by a monolayer of *OH under the reaction conditions according to the Pourbaix diagram. A method of electric field controlling constant potential was used to calculate the electrochemical barriers on anatase PtO2(100). It was found that the electrochemical barriers of the oxygen evolution reaction will increase with the decrease of potential, while the thermochemical limiting step of the eN2OR is insensitive to potential. Thus, the eN2OR selectivity can be improved by lowering the applied potential. This work unveils fundamental insights into eN2OR and provides a unified understanding to experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge distribution modulation of hollow flower-like tungsten doped nickel nitride for alkaline hydrogen oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.150272</link>
      <description>Liwei An, Guanyu Luo, Jun Yang, Jiang Zhu, Deli Wang, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392603354

                Exploring efficient nickel (Ni)-based catalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) to replace platinum group metal (PGM) is highly essential for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells. Nevertheless, the HOR activity of Ni is far away from PGM owing to the strong hydrogen adsorption. Herein, the tungsten-doped nickel nitride (W-Ni3N) with modulated local charge distribution and hollow flower structure is presented to improve the HOR performance. Mechanism studies reveal that W doping induces the redistribution of local charge around Ni sites due to the electron transfer from Ni to W, which strengthens the hydroxyl adsorption and simultaneously weakens hydrogen adsorption. Benefitting from the optimized adsorption of HOR intermediates and hollow flower structure, W-Ni3N exhibits improved intrinsic activity and mass activity, which are 1.7 and 10 times higher than that of pure Ni3N, respectively. This work presents a promising way to design cost-effective electrocatalysts by fine-tuning the electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Progress of Pt and iron-group transition metal alloy catalysts with high ORR activity for PEMFCs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118165</link>
      <description>Zhen Zhou, Huijuan Zhang, Xiaoxiong Feng, Zhong Ma, Zi-Feng Ma, Yuhua Xue, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392624259

                The performances of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are affected by the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Platinum (Pt)-based catalysts can effectively improve the ORR by reducing the activation energy and substantially increase the reaction rate. However, due to the scarcity and high price of Pt, the exploration of PtM alloy catalysts with low Pt loading, high ORR activity and stability has become the focus of ORR research. Therefore, this paper reviews the recent progresses of Pt and iron-group transition metal alloy catalysts with high ORR activity and stability for PEMFCs. Firstly, the ORR theoretical mechanism is introduced. Then, we discuss several types of PtM (M=Fe, Co, Ni) alloy catalysts, including binary and ternary alloys, especially to understand the effect of particle size, shape (nanostructures, hollow structure, core-shell), structure (intermetallic compounds) and supports (new carbon, MOF derivatives, metal oxides) on the utilization rate of Pt and the ORR catalytic performance, including the ORR catalytic activity and stability. Finally, we analyze the remaining challenges and the future of PtM alloy catalysts.</description>

      <title>In pursuit of a bifunctional designing toward highly efficient overall water splitting in a hydrogen-functionalized two-dimensional covalent organic framework via single transition metal mapping</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.03.044</link>
      <description>Chunyao Fang, Di Liu, Qiang Zhang, Guiju Liu, Chenglong Shi, Jingcheng Xu, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 62(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392626253

                Developing highly active metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs), as a thriving topic in overall water-splitting, can maximum atom utilization efficiency and yet entail high activity, and bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts can enable more efficient overall water-splitting meanwhile reducing the cost than two individual unifunctional electrocatalysts. Bifunctional HER/OER SACs are thus of enormous economic importance and scientific interest. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a design of the optimal bifunctional SACs was achieved, namely, C30N12Se6H12 supported Rh (Rh@CNSeH). Also worth noting is that Rh@CNSeH stands out among 23 candidates and holds the promise of as an efficient bifunctional catalyst due to low HER/OER overpotential of 0.003/0.39 V, outperforming the commercial Pt (0.09 V)/IrO2 (0.55 V) and achieving the overall water-splitting. Good stability demonstrated by calculations of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, antioxidant capacity and Pourbaix diagram ensured the implementation of Rh@CNSeH in ambient conditions. Remarkably, &#916;GOH* can act as an energy descriptor to reveal and even predict the OER activity trend, whose changing trend can be quantitatively described by charge transfer descriptor (Bader charge analysis) and electronic structure descriptors (d-band center and integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP)). Moreover, an intrinsic descriptor (&#966;) coupled with the electronegativity and the d-electrons number of transition-metal can give a reasonable prediction and explanation for the catalytic activity origin. Finally, we built a bridge for structure-property relationship from intrinsic characteristics to Bader charge, to d-band center, to ICOHP and then to free energies of intermediates, which can intuitively herald the activity origin of OER and give a reasonable guidance toward high-efficient designing for SACs.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for optimizing oxygen reduction on Pt monolayer core&#8211;shell catalysts</title>

                Abstract As a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) has emerged as a versatile tool in accelerating catalytic materials discovery because of its ability to find complex patterns in high&#8208;dimensional data. While the intricacy of cutting&#8208;edge ML models, such as deep learning, makes them powerful, it also renders decision&#8208;making processes challenging to explain. Recent advances in explainable AI technologies, which aim to make the inner workings of ML models understandable to humans, have considerably increased our capacity to gain insights from data. In this study, taking the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on {111}&#8208;oriented Pt monolayer core&#8211;shell catalysts as an example, we show how the recently developed theory&#8208;infused neural network (TinNet) algorithm enables a rapid search for optimal site motifs with the chemisorption energy of hydroxyl (OH) as a single descriptor, revealing the underlying physical factors that govern the variations in site reactivity. By exploring a broad design space of Pt monolayer core&#8211;shell alloys ( candidates) that were generated from thermodynamically stable bulk structures in existing material databases, we identified novel alloy systems along with previously known catalysts in the goldilocks zone of reactivity properties. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals the important role of adsorbate resonance energies that originate from &#8208;band interactions in chemical bonding at metal surfaces. Extracting physical insights into surface reactivity with explainable AI opens up new design pathways for optimizing catalytic performance beyond active sites.</description>

                Abstract The advancement of photocatalysis relies on the development of novel hetero-structured materials with unique architectures. In this study, we successfully synthesized a hetero-structured g-C 3 N 4 (GCN) material with a distinctive surface modification. To further enhance its photocatalytic performance, we optimized the Ag-Ni concentration to maximize the active sites for hydrogen evolution reactions. By using systematic physicochemical characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the pivotal role of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) in facilitating the formation of an efficient charge transfer channel and promoting the effective generation and separation of photo-generated carriers. From the DFT calculations, we also demonstrated that the Ag-Ni nanoparticles provide more efficient active sites than Ni nanoparticles for water splitting and hydrogen evolution and In-situ TEM exploration. Furthermore, the hetero microstructure consisting of thin g-C 3 N 4 nano scrolls has a crucial role in shortening the migration distance of the carriers, effectively suppressing carrier recombination. Consequently, these extraordinary characteristics resulted in a superior solar light-driven photocatalytic H 2 evolution rate of 2507 &#181;mol h &#8722; 1 g &#8722; 1 , surpassing the rate achieved by bulk g-C 3 N 4 by a remarkable 18.6-folds. Moreover, the apparent quantum efficiency of this hetero-structured material reached an exceptional value of 1.6% under a 1.5 G air mass filter.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical water splitting to produce green hydrogen offers a promising technology for renewable energy conversion and storage, as well as realizing carbon neutrality. The efficiency, stability, and cost of electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrocatalytic overall water splitting (EOWS) at large current densities are essential for practical application. In this review, the key factors that determine the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts at large current densities are summarized from the angel of thermodynamic and kinetic correlation. The corresponding design strategies are presented. The electronic structure and density of active sites that affect the adsorption/desorption of intermediates are considered as the thermodynamic aspects, while charge transfer and mass transport capabilities closely associated with electrode resistance and intermediate diffusion are assigned as kinetic effects. Recent development of bifunctional and integrated electrocatalysts toward EOWS is also discussed in detail. Finally, the perspective and direction on the electrocatalytic water splitting under large current density are proposed.

      <title>Mechanistic insight into the catalytic CO oxidation and SO2 resistance over Mo-decorated Pt/TiO2 catalyst: The essential role of Mo</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.150319</link>

                The problem of CO oxidation in incomplete combustion from steel industry is that the deactivation of Pt-based catalysts by SO2. Here, we have elaborately designed a series of Mo-decorated 0.1 wt% Pt/TiO2 catalyst (Pt/Mo/Ti) catalyst. The catalytic test showed that the Pt/3Mo/Ti catalyst achieved 100 % CO conversion above 200 &#176;C and maintained excellent long-term catalytic stability in the presence of SO2. The enhancement in SO2-tolerance ability was due to the suitable Br&#248;nsted acidity to weaken the SO2 adsorption and strong charge transfer ability to reduce the oxidation of SO2 to SO3. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) suggests that the Pt-O-Mo species are present in atomically dispersed form in the Pt/3Mo/Ti catalyst. The surface O = MoO4 sites with terminal Mo = O bond prevented SO2 from reacting with platinum, thus inhibiting its migration to TiO2 and TiOSO4 formation. We also revealed the strong interaction between platinum and molybdenum and characterized the CO oxidation pathway in the presence of SO2. This research offers new insights into the mechanism of the catalytic CO oxidation and SO2 resistance over Mo-decorated Pt/TiO2 catalyst.</description>

      <title>A review on synthesis and modification of cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides as hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts for water electrolysis</title>

                Hydrogen energy as the alternative to fossil fuel received wide attention. Among different methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis is the cleanest and most promising method. However, its development is greatly limited by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop low-cost, high activity, and good stability of non-precious metal catalyst to replace the precious metal catalyst (Pt, RuO2), and to further reduce overpotential and power consumption. To date, great efforts have been made to develop transition metal compounds with electrocatalytic performance, such as sulfides, oxides, and carbides materials. Especially, transition metal sulfides play a very important role as catalysts and have attracted wide attention for their structural adjustability, high abundance, and mild preparation process. In this introduction, we focus on the role of transition metal sulfides in catalysts for water electrolysis, especially in a few most studied sulfides such as cobalt/molybdenum based sulfides and the recently reported homogeneous cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides, in which cobalt acts as a key element. Composition, morphology, and size are the most important factors that influence the intrinsic activity, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure of these transition metal sulfides. Besides, the effect of carbon nanomaterials as carrier materials is also discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the great potentials of cobalt and molybdenum based sulfides with high performance, and to help improve the performance of existing sulfides and explore new modification methods.</description>

                Recently, surface reconstruction derived from Ir-based derivatives could achieve satisfactory oxygen evolution performance. Herein, ultra-long nanowire hollandite structured Rb0.17IrO2 was synthesized and a nano-amorphous layer with a thickness of &#8764;1.5 nm was achieved by interfacial oxidation treatment. The prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding water oxidation activity with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 330 mV for robust continuous operation in acidic media. Through the spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the nano-amorphous layers induced by interfacial oxidation on the one-dimensional (1D)-nanowire surface have enhanced O-2p centers and increased Ir-O hybridization compared to the bulk Rb0.17IrO2 phase, which essentially balances the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Effectively incorporating surface reconstruction behavior could significantly improve catalyst activity. This work effectively combines 1D Ir-based materials and surface reconstruction, which provides a strategy for the subsequent full utilization of Ir-based materials applied on OER process.</description>

      <title>Heterojunction of MXenes and MN4&#8211;graphene: Machine learning to accelerate the design of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts</title>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for the development of excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts, which are key functions in clean energy production. The emphasis of this study lies in the rapid design and investigation of 153 MN4&#8211;graphene (Gra)/ MXene (M2NO) electrocatalysts for ORR/OER catalytic activity using machine learning (ML) and density functional theory (DFT). The DFT results indicated that CoN4&#8211;Gra/Ti2NO had both good ORR (0.37 V) and OER (0.30 V) overpotentials, while TiN4&#8211;Gra/M2NO and MN4&#8211;Gra/Cr2NO had high overpotentials. Our research further indicated orbital spin polarization and d-band centers far from the Fermi energy level, affecting the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thus reducing the catalytic activity. The ML results showed that the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model successfully predicted the overpotentials of the monofunctional catalysts RhN4&#8211;Gra/Ti2NO (ORR, 0.39 V) and RuN4&#8211;Gra/W2NO (OER, 0.45 V) as well as the overpotentials of the bifunctional catalyst RuN4&#8211;Gra/W2NO (ORR, 0.39 V; OER, 0.45 V). The symbolic regression (SR) algorithm was used to construct the overpotential descriptors without environmental variable features to accelerate the catalyst screening and shorten the trial-and-error costs from the source, providing a reliable theoretical basis for the experimental synthesis of MXene heterostructures.</description>

                Carbon-containing fuels, major energy sources, pose environmental challenges with their greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing the imperative for clean energy in our industrialized era, copper oxide emerges as a viable electrocatalyst for hydrogen production through water splitting, offering an eco-friendly alternative to precious metals. Electrolytic water splitting using copper oxide proves highly efficient, ensuring rapid and uncontaminated hydrogen production. Researchers globally are actively pursuing economically viable implementations of this process. This study exclusively focuses on CuO-based nanostructures, exploring their role as efficient electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It investigates various environmentally friendly synthesis methods and analyzes the crystal structure of copper oxide under different parameters. Assessing CuO-based catalyst activity in OER and HER under diverse conditions, the study provides a comprehensive overview of their electrocatalytic performance in water splitting. Integrating this knowledge with catalyst developments holds promise for advancing sustainable hydrogen production. The study concludes by discussing future research aspects and pinpointing gaps to guide the development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate-Dependent Electronic Structure Descriptors for Machine Learning-Driven Binding Energy Predictions in Diverse Single Atom Alloys: A Reductionist Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c07398</link>
      <description>Javad Shirani, J. R. Vald&#233;s, Alain B. Tchagang, Kirk H. Bevan, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392579703

                A long-standing challenge in the design of single atom alloys (SAAs), for catalytic applications, is the determination of a feature space that maximally correlates to molecular binding energies per the Sabatier principle. The more representative a feature space is of the underlying binding properties, the greater the predictive capability of a given machine learning (ML) algorithm. Moreover, the greater the diversity and range of SAA impurities/sites examined, the greater the difficulty in arriving at such a predictive feature. In this work, we undertake to examine the degree to which adsorbate electronic structure properties might address this challenge, in a distinct departure from the traditional substrate electronic structure feature construction found in the catalysis literature. Specifically, as a model system, we explore the predictive capacity of the p-orbital projected density of states (PDOS) pertaining to the adsorption of CO molecules on a wide range of SAA substrates, impurity embeddings, and vicinal cuts. This analysis is executed in two parts. First, we explore the degree to which the entire PDOS distribution, in the form of an energy-dependent vector, can predict binding energies. Subsequently, guided by a rigorous intrinsic dimensionality analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection visualization, and chemical intuition, we are able to reduce the predictive feature space to just three physical quantities based on semicore level properties and charge filling of the adsorbate&#8211;as embedded with the PDOS distribution. This near-intrinsic feature space and the PDOS distribution are both shown to provide significant improvements in predictive accuracy when coupled with regression-based ML methods, even when tackling highly diverse chemical datasets. The results of this analysis both further substantiate the transferability characteristics of SAAs and indicate that adsorbate-based electronic structure features (from either relaxed or unrelaxed chemical datasets) are powerful tools in the prediction of catalytic binding energies in such systems. They also underscore the predictive benefit of finding a feature space with a dimension equal to the intrinsic dimensionality of the data that can maximally correlate with the physical property under investigation when employing ML methods in catalysis studies.</description>

      <description>Sampath Prabhakaran, Do Hwan Kim, Applied Surface Science. 658(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392737749

                Efficient, stable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions have been in demand for decades. Recently, layered transition metals (Co, Mo, Ni, and Fe) and chalcogen compounds (S/Se/Te) gained prominence in catalysis and device studies. Density functional theory identified the covalency of Co and Mo, oxygenated bimetallic selenium bond, crystal structure distortions, and adsorption properties as crucial for enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Hybridizing the Co and Mo d-orbitals around the Fermi level of 0.463 eV improves bonding with metal surface-adsorbate intermediates validated by partial density of states. Oxygenated cobalt molybdenum selenide (O-CoMoSe2) (2 1 0) exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic properties at various active sites, with Gibbs free energy and theoretical overpotential at an active site of Co = 0.086 eV, 0.41 V, and Se = 0.50 V.</description>

                Lateral (adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate) interactions between adsorbed molecules affect various physical and chemical properties of microporous adsorbents and catalysts, influencing their functional properties. In this work, we studied the hydration of microporous AlPO4-11 aluminophosphate, which has an unusually ordered structure upon adsorption of water vapor, and according to 27Al NMR data, only tetrahedrally or octahedrally coordinated Al sites are present in the AlPO4-11. These 27Al NMR data are consistent with the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of hydrated AlPO4-11, which revealed the presence of a strong repulsive lateral interaction at the initial stage of adsorption, suppressing the adsorption of water on neighboring (separated by one &#8722;O&#8211;P&#8211;O&#8211; bridge) Al crystallographic sites. As a result, of all the different aluminum sites, only half of the Al1 sites adsorb two water molecules and acquire octahedral coordination.</description>
