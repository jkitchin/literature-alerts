                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a multistep proton-coupled four-electron process with sluggish kinetics, which seriously limits the hydrogen production efficiency, thus it is of great importance to develop an efficient and stable OER catalyst. In this study, a two-step differential pyrolysis strategy is employed to design a three-dimensional porous microstructured material consisting of RuOx nanoparticles coated by a thin-layer carbon, where the active particles were isolated in separate chambers and the RuOx nanoparticles mainly existed in the form of a heterogeneous interface between RuO2 and partial metallic Ru. The preparation parameters of the catalysts are optimized via combining transient and steady-state polarization properties, and the target catalyst Cat-500&#8211;1.5t shows the best OER catalytic performance after ca. 60 h of a chronopotentiometry test in an acidic medium with a much smaller performance change than other samples. The unique design of adopting a carbon layer to form separate reaction chambers largely mitigates the excessive oxidation loss of the active components under strong oxidation potential. The suitability of the catalyst with the loaded substrate and test media is explored, and in an acidic medium, the carbon paper is much better than the titanium fiber, while in an alkaline medium, the titanium fiber is obviously superior to the carbon paper. On both carbon paper and titanium fiber, the performance in an alkaline medium outperforms that in an acidic medium, and the possible reasons for the performance difference are analyzed. Herein, to obtain the actual electrocatalytic performance, the optimal design of the catalyst structure and matching suitable conductive substrate in a specific medium are quite necessary, which provides a feasible strategy for the acquisition of efficient and stable electrocatalysts and the desirable presentation of performance.</description>

      <title>Ab initio characterization of protein molecular dynamics with AI2BMD</title>

                Biomolecular dynamics simulation is a fundamental technology for life sciences research, and its usefulness depends on its accuracy and efficiency1&#8211;3. Classical molecular dynamics simulation is fast but lacks chemical accuracy4,5. Quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory can reach chemical accuracy but cannot scale to support large biomolecules6. Here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based ab initio biomolecular dynamics system (AI2BMD) that can efficiently simulate full-atom large biomolecules with ab initio accuracy. AI2BMD uses a protein fragmentation scheme and a machine learning force field7 to achieve generalizable ab initio accuracy for energy and force calculations for various proteins comprising more than 10,000 atoms. Compared to density functional theory, it reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude. With several hundred nanoseconds of dynamics simulations, AI2BMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently explore the conformational space of peptides and proteins, deriving accurate 3J couplings that match nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and showing protein folding and unfolding processes. Furthermore, AI2BMD enables precise free-energy calculations for protein folding, and the estimated thermodynamic properties are well aligned with experiments. AI2BMD could potentially complement wet-lab experiments, detect the dynamic processes of bioactivities and enable biomedical research that is impossible to conduct at present. A study introduces AI2BMD, an artificial intelligence-based dynamics simulation program that uses protein fragmentation with a machine learning force field to accurately and efficiently model the folding and unfolding of large proteins.</description>

      <title>Integrated Carbon Dioxide Capture by Amines and Conversion to Methane on Single-Atom Nickel Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09744</link>
      <description>Tomaz Neves&#8208;Garcia, Mahmudul Hasan, Quansong Zhu, Jing Li, Zhan Jiang, Yongye Liang, Hailiang Wang, Liane M. Rossi, Robert E. Warburton, L. Robert Baker, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404112538

                Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture species, i.e., carbamate and (bi)carbonate, can be promising for CO2 capture and conversion from point-source, where the energetically demanding stripping step is bypassed. Here, we describe a class of atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts electrodeposited on various electrode surfaces that are shown to directly convert captured CO2 to methane (CH4). A detailed study employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy (EM) indicate that highly dispersed Ni atoms are uniquely active for converting capture species to CH4, and the activity of single-atom Ni is confirmed using control experiments with a molecularly defined Ni phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. Comparing the kinetics of various capture solutions obtained from hydroxide, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines provide evidence that carbamate, rather than (bi)carbonate and/or dissolved CO2, is primarily responsible for CH4 production. This conclusion is supported by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of capture solutions as well as control experiments comparing reaction selectivity with and without CO2 purging. These findings are understood with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed on gold (Au) is active for the direct reduction of carbamate, producing CH4 as the primary product. This is the first example of direct electrochemical conversion of carbamate to CH4, and the mechanism of this process provides new insight on the potential for integrated capture and conversion of CO2 directly to hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Automated image acquisition and analysis of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride from pristine to highly defective and amorphous structures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-77740-9</link>

                Abstract Defect-engineered and even amorphous two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently gained interest due to properties that differ from their pristine counterparts. Since these properties are highly sensitive to the exact atomic structure, it is crucial to be able to characterize them at atomic resolution over large areas. This is only possible when the imaging process is automated to reduce the time spent on manual imaging, which at the same time reduces the observer bias in selecting the imaged areas. Since the necessary datasets include at least hundreds if not thousands of images, the analysis process similarly needs to be automated. Here, we introduce disorder into graphene and monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using low-energy argon ion irradiation, and characterize the resulting disordered structures using automated scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field imaging combined with convolutional neural network-based analysis techniques. We show that disorder manifests in these materials in a markedly different way, where graphene accommodates vacancy-type defects by transforming hexagonal carbon rings into other polygonal shapes, whereas in hBN the disorder is observed simply as vacant lattice sites with very little rearrangement of the remaining atoms. Correspondingly, in the case of graphene, the highest introduced disorder leads to an amorphous membrane, whereas in hBN, the highly defective lattice contains a large number of vacancies and small pores with no indication of amorphisation. Overall, our study demonstrates that combining automated imaging and image analysis is a powerful way to characterize the structure of disordered and amorphous 2D materials, while also illustrating some of the remaining shortcomings with this methodology.</description>

      <title>Shear Deformation of Non-modulated Ni2MnGa Martensite: An Ab Initio Study</title>

                Abstract The impact of shear deformation in $$(101)[10\overline{1}]$$    ( 101 )   [ 10  1 &#175;  ]    system of non-modulated (NM) martensite in Ni 2 MnGa ferromagnetic shape memory alloy is investigated by means of ab initio atomistic simulations. The shear system is associated with twinning of NM lattice and intermatensitic transformation to modulated structures. The stability of the NM lattice increases with increasing content of Mn. The most realistic shear mechanism for twin reorientation can be approximated by the simple shear mechanism, although the lowest barriers were calculated for pure shear mechanism. The energy barrier between twin variants further reduces due to spontaneous appearance of lattice modulation or, in other words, the nanotwins with thickness of two atomic planes. Such nanotwins appear also on the generalized planar fault energy (GPFE) curve calculated using a newly developed advanced procedure and exhibits even lower energy than the defect free NM structure. These nanotwin doublelayers are also basic building blocks of modulated structures and play an important role in intermartensitic transformation.</description>

                The design and development of highly active non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for metal-air batteries. In this work, the electrocatalytic performance of different p-block metal (PM = Sn, Sb, Pb and Bi) atoms embedded in the g-CN monolayer (PMx@g-CN, x = 1&#8211;3) for the OER and ORR was systematically investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The strong interaction between PMx atoms and g-CN substrates indicates the good stability of PMx@g-CN catalysts. Among all the designed catalysts, Bi3@g-CN is found to be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the OER and ORR with the calculated overpotential &#951;OER and &#951;ORR of 0.23 and 0.25 V, respectively. With the atomic active sites of PMx increasing from x = 1 to 3, the OER and ORR catalytic activity is enhanced. The correlations between the overpotentials of the OER/ORR and Bader charge values of the anchored PMx atoms of the catalysts were established. Our findings contribute to searching for noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts and shed light on the rational design of atomic active sites on electrocatalysts.</description>

                In this study, the high catalytic reactivity of ruthenium phosphide (RuP2) has been identified by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Complex surface reconstructions are considered by applying the ab initio grand canonical Monte Carlo (ai-GCMC) algorithm, efficiently providing a sufficient phase-space exploration of possible surfaces. Combined with surface-phase Pourbaix diagrams, we are able to identify the actual surfaces that obtained under specific experimental environments, thus leading to a more accurate understanding of the nature of the active sites and the binding strength of adsorbates. Specifically, through hundreds of surface reconstructions and hydrogenation states generated with ai-GCMC, we identify the most favorable surface phases of RuP2 under aqueous acidic conditions. We discover that the HER activity is determined by multiple surfaces with different stoichiometries within a narrow electrode potential window. Low HER overpotential (&#951;) has been found for each of the identified surfaces, as low as 0.04 V. High H-coverage reconstructed surfaces have been discovered under acidic conditions, and the surface Ru sites introduced by additional Ru adatoms or exposed by P-vacancies serve as the active sites for HER based on their nearly reversible H binding. This work provides atomistic insights into the origin of high HER activity on RuP2 by exploring the dynamic surface phases of electrocatalysts and features a generalizable method to explore the reconstructed/hydrogenated surface space as a function of experimental conditions.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant attention due to their high atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. However, the catalytic mechanisms related to the active center and coordination environment remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities of NiN 4 , NiN 3 , NiN 3 H 2 , NiN 4 X, NiN 3 X, and NiN 3 H 2 X (X denotes axial ligand) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study unveils two distinct reaction pathways for ORR and OER, involving proton&#8208;electron pairs adsorbed from both the solution and the catalyst surface. The overpotential is the key parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance when proton&#8208;electron pairs are adsorbed from the solution. NiN 3 and NiN 3 H 2 show promise as pH&#8208;universal bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. On the other hand, when proton&#8208;electron pairs are adsorbed from the catalyst surface, the reaction energy barrier becomes the crucial metric for assessing catalytic activity. Our investigation reveals that NiN 3 H 2 consistently exhibits optimal ORR activity across a wide pH range, regardless of the source of proton&#8208;electron pair (solvent or catalyst surface).</description>

                Abstract Interface engineering is an efficient strategy to create high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for water splitting. In the present work, CeO 2 @CoSe 2 nanoneedle on carbon cloth (CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC) demonstrates high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water splitting. CeO 2 with abundant O vacancies facilitates the adsorption of OH &#8722; and boosts the reconstruction of CoSe 2 into CoOOH at lower potentials. The in situ generated active CeO 2 @CoOOH heterointerface upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co site, thereby decreasing the free energy of rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) ( * O to * OOH) during the OER process. It delivers a low OER overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC is also found to be active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 138 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), profiting from CeO 2 &#8208;facilitated * H 2 O dissociation and * H adsorption on CoSe 2 . The overall water splitting is achieved over the CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC bifunctional electrode with a low electrolysis voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work offers valuable insights into CeO 2 &#8208;assisted surface reconstruction as well as provides water electrolysis catalysts through interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of CumAgn Bimetallic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252212053</link>
      <description>Turki Alotaibi, Moteb Alotaibi, Fatimah Alhawiti, Norah Aldosari, Majd Alsunaid, Lama Aldawas, Talal F. Qahtan, Ali K. Ismael, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 25(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404224096

                The urgent demand for efficient CO2 reduction technologies has driven enormous studies into the enhancement of advanced catalysts. Here, we investigate the electronic properties and CO2 adsorption properties of CumAgn bimetallic clusters, particularly Cu4Ag1, Cu1Ag4, Cu3Ag2, and Cu2Ag3, using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)/density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the atomic arrangement within these clusters drastically affects their stability, charge transfer, and catalytic performance. The Cu4Ag1 bimetallic cluster emerges as the most stable structure, revealing superior charge transfer and effective chemisorption of CO2, which promotes effective activation of the CO2 molecule. In contrast, the Cu1Ag4 bimetallic cluster, in spite of comparable adsorption energy, indicates insignificant charge transfer, resulting in less pronounced CO2 activation. The Cu3Ag2 and Cu2Ag3 bimetallic clusters also display high adsorption energies with remarkable charge transfer mechanisms, emphasizing the crucial role of metal composition in tuning catalytic characteristics. This thorough examination provides constructive insights into the design of bimetallic clusters for boosted CO2 reduction. These findings could pave the way for the development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts for industrial CO2 reduction, contributing to global efforts in carbon management and climate change mitigation.</description>

      <title>Simplification of solvation shell with water clusters in the simulation of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction</title>

                Electrochemical methods for nitrogen reduction have received extensive attention due to the mild reaction conditions. In order to gain an insight into the mechanism of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction process, theoretical simulations are necessary. However, current simulation studies contain many imprecise approximations that may hinder the real recognition of the reaction process. Although solvation methods have recently been developed to provide efficient descriptions, their further applications are hindered by controversy over modeling of solvents and the enormous computational effort required. In this work, we simplify the solvation conditions by using water clusters and compare them with an accurate water layer model. The results demonstrate that the simplified water clusters can effectively capture protons, simulate the surface electric environment, and enable the calculation of the activation energy of the reaction. This method offers an affordable approach for simulating the surface potentials and solvents and provides a new reference for the theoretical study of the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Activation of Hidden Catalytic Sites in 2D Basal Plane via p&#8211;n Heterojunction Interface Engineering Toward Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Abstract Nonprecious metal&#8208;based 2D materials have shown promising electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the catalytically active sites of 2D materials are mainly presented at the edge, and most of their basal planes are still catalytically inactive, which turns into a significant drawback on the catalytic efficiency. Here, a novel p&#8211;n heterojunction strategy is suggested that generates active sites on the basal plane of 2D NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH). The n&#8208;type NiFe&#8208;LDH is first grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, and p&#8208;type Co 3 O 4 nanocubes are deposited through a simple dip&#8208;coating method to fabricate a Co 3 O 4 /NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF p&#8211;n heterojunction electrode. As a result, electron transfer is induced at the interface of p&#8208;type Co 3 O 4 and n&#8208;type NiFe&#8208;LDH, which consequently promotes oxidation of the inert Ni 2+ state to a more catalytically active Ni 3+ state on the inert basal plane of NiFe&#8208;LDH. As&#8208;prepared Co 3 O 4 /NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF electrodes obtained enhanced OER performance showing a high current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.48 V (vs RHE) which outperforms that of pristine NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF. The utilization of the p&#8211;n junction concept will disclose a new strategy for modifying the electronic structure of the catalytically inactive basal plane and stimulating its electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>A general machine-learning framework for high-throughput screening for stable and efficient RuO2-based acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalysts</title>

                Abstract Doping guest elements is an effective way to increase activity and stability of RuO2 catalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to the vastness of doping space, it is challenging for either high-cost experiments or density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen out the doped structures with the optimized catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a machine-learning (ML) framework that aims to realize high-throughput screening for both stability and activity of doped-RuO2 acidic OER catalysts from mono-doping to triple-doping at a low level of computational cost. Compared to the d-band theory and some other previous models, our ML model was constructed based on more general input features and realized higher prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074, 0.142 and 0.082 eV for *OH, *O and *OOH adsorption, respectively. Through the ML models, three doping structures, Ru41Zn7O96, Ru41Zn4Fe3O96, and Ru39Zn4Cu4Co1O96 were found to possess the extraordinarily high stability and comparable or higher activity than the previously reported OER catalysts. This work provided an efficient study paradigm in fields of material screening and a useful guide for experimental synthesis.</description>
