      <title>Tuning Metal/Oxygen Redox Sequence through Constructing [Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Co] Unit for Enhancing Oxygen Evolution</title>

                Abstract Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is a promising approach to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet effectively enhancing the lattice oxygen participation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we aim to enhance the lattice oxygen participation of spinel Co 3 O 4 in OER through introducing rare&#8208;earth europium (Eu) and constructing the [Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Co] unit. The constructed [Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Co] unit facilitates electron donation from Eu to surrounding Co&#8208;O sites, thereby altering the redox sequence of transition metal and lattice oxygen. This structural innovation enables Eu&#8208;Co 3 O 4 to present outstanding OER performance including a low overpotential of 305 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , robust long&#8208;term stability, and high efficiency in rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the [Eu&#8208;O&#8208;Co] unit enhances lattice oxygen redox dynamics and enables direct O&#9472;O bond formation. The occupied Eu&#8208;4f spin&#8208;up orbitals near the Fermi level play a crucial role in activating highly labile lattice oxygen at Eu&#8208;neighboring oxygen sites, promoting lattice oxygen participation in the non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer process, and lowing the thermodynamically limiting potential of LOM pathway. These findings underscore the importance of rare&#8208;earth elements in modulating lattice oxygen redox dynamics, offering valuable insights for advancing the design of OER catalysts.</description>

                In this work, we systematically investigate the structure of Sr and Mg doped lanthanum gallate single crystals using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD analysis revealed the presence of multiple domains with distinct lattice parameters. High-resolution TEM and integrated differential phase contrast imaging captured two regions, one with 90&#176; symmetry and the other with non-90&#176; symmetry. In addition, ordered oxygen vacancies in the non-90&#176; region were revealed, while vacancies in the 90&#176; region were randomly distributed. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed that the difference in the doping level of the two regions is within the detectability limits. However, the electron energy loss near-edge structure revealed detectable differences in their bonding character.</description>

                ABSTRACT Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and selectivity are regarded as excellent OER catalysts, but easily corroded under acidic environment. Here, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to design a series of SACs protected by twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) &#8220;chainmail.&#8221; Charge transfer analysis showed that the carbon layer could serve as an intermediate between transition metal atom and reactants. In addition, rotation operation on bilayer graphene was applied to further enhance the catalytic performance. Thermodynamic free energy diagrams of eight types metal atoms and five rotation angles were systematically discussed. A volcano plot of overpotentials among all the studied single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts can be described by (). The designed Ni&#8208;tBLG catalyst (rotation angle is 21.8&#176;) exhibited the best performance with the lowest OER overpotential of 0.35 V. These results revealed that the selected single metal atom twisted bilayer graphene catalysts with high activity and stability could be treated as efficient OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Behavior of Phenyl&#8208;Substituted Cyclopropanecarboxylic Acid on Al and Cu Surfaces: A Combined Experimental and First&#8208;Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/qua.70080</link>
      <description>Tuncay Karakurt, Alaaddin &#199;ukuroval&#305;, &#304;brahim Y&#305;lmaz, International Journal of Quantum Chemistry. 125(14)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412123726

                ABSTRACT The molecular structure of phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (PSCCA, C 12 H 14 O 2 ; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylcyclobutane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid ) was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and X&#8208;ray crystallography techniques. Following structural confirmation, its molecular geometry was optimized at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level. The van der Waals interactions were accurately accounted for using the DFT&#8208;D3 method in the CP2K program. Understanding the adsorption behavior of organic molecules on metal surfaces is of great significance for applications in catalysis, sensor design, surface functionalization, and corrosion prevention. In this context, the adsorption properties of the PSCCA molecule on Al and Cu surfaces were investigated in detail using DFT&#8208;based CP2K calculations. By optimizing different adsorption configurations, the binding energies of the most stable structures were calculated and compared. The obtained results indicate that the PSCCA molecule strongly binds to both Al and Cu surfaces, with a higher adsorption energy on the Al surface compared to the Cu surface. In addition, Mulliken population analysis revealed distinct electronic charge transfer characteristics upon adsorption, with substantially stronger electron transfer observed on the Cu(111) surface due to enhanced d&#8208;band&#8211;ligand orbital hybridization. This electronic behavior correlates with the adsorption strength and highlights the critical role of metal electronic structure in governing surface interactions. Electron density difference analyses suggest that PSCCA interacts with both surfaces via a physisorption mechanism. Furthermore, assessments in the context of surface inhibitor efficiency reveal that PSCCA has the potential to passivate active surface regions and hinder surface reactions. Analyses conducted under different pH conditions indicate that the inhibitory effect of PSCCA is particularly pronounced in acidic environments. These findings suggest that PSCCA, exhibiting higher adsorption energy and stability on the Al surface, can be considered an effective protective agent and may play a crucial role in the design of metal&#8211;organic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Constructing Sulfur Vacancy-Rich NiCo2S4@MoS2 Core@shell Heterostructure via Interface Engineering for Enhanced HER Electrocatalysis</title>

                The rational design of heterointerfaces with optimized charge dynamics and defect engineering remains pivotal for developing advanced non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. A comparative study of NiCo2S4&#8211;MoS2 heterostructures was conducted to elucidate the impact of interfacial architecture and defect engineering on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. A core@shell NiCo2S4@MoS2 heterostructure was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal growth method, inducing lattice distortion and strong interfacial coupling, while supported NiCo2S4/MoS2 heterostructures were prepared by ultrasonic-assisted deposition. A detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculation demonstrated that the core@shell configuration promotes charge redistribution across the NiCo2S4&#8211;MoS2 interface and generates abundant sulfur vacancies, thereby increasing the density of electroactive sites. Electrochemical measurements reveal that NiCo2S4@MoS2 markedly outperforms the supported heterostructure, single-component NiCo2S4, and MoS2 when serving as the HER catalyst in acid solution. These findings establish a dual-optimization strategy&#8212;combining interfacial design with vacancy modulation&#8212;that provides a generalizable paradigm for the deliberate design of high-efficiency non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting reactions.</description>

      <title>Competitive Carbonate Binding Hinders Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to CO on Cu Surfaces at Low Overpotentials</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to useful chemicals holds promise for a sustainable carbon cycle. However, the key factors that control the pathways to various desired products remain unresolved, partially due to the limited knowledge of reaction intermediates on the electrode surface. To address this, we utilize in situ electrochemical shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory calculation to examine the potential-dependent composition of adsorbed species during CO2 reduction on polycrystalline copper. The results reveal that carbonate anion adsorption outcompetes other carbon-containing species, including adsorbed CO2 activation intermediate *COO- and *CO, which has the effect of anodically shifting the onset potential of *CO formation in electrolyte solutions with a lower carbonate concentration. These results suggest that the competitive binding of carbonate impedes the reduction of CO2 on the Cu surface. Monte Carlo simulations show that both potential dependent electrode surface change and electrode-carbonate Coulomb interaction are key to understanding the competitive binding process. Our findings suggest that reducing the competitive binding of carbonate may be a promising route to improve the CO2 reduction on Cu electrodes at low overpotentials.</description>

      <title>Strain-Engineered Rh Single Atoms on Curved WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for Hydrogen Production and Coupled Photochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c04928</link>

                Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet the high energy demand of water electrolysis limits its widespread adoption. Catalysis is crucial to enhance the efficiency of hydrogen production and lower energy costs. However, conventional catalyst design guided by the d-band theory faces inconsistencies in predicting adsorption behavior, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major efficiency bottleneck. To address these challenges, we developed a strain-engineered Rh single-atom catalyst anchored on curved WS2 supported by carbon nanotubes (RhSA/WS2@CNT) to modulate the electronic structure. The resultant catalyst achieves an ultralow overpotential of 17.4 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and a mass activity &#8764;65 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the H* adsorption trend contradicts d-band theory predictions but is explained by orbital symmetry adaptation, where the strain-modulated dxz orbital plays a major role in governing adsorption energetics. Beyond catalyst design, the HER catalyst was coupled with a photocatalytic iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) to replace the OER and reduce the water-splitting voltage to 0.7 V. This study not only introduces a strain-engineering strategy to optimize single-atom catalysts but also demonstrates a coupled electro-photo system that enhances energy efficiency, offering an alternative approach for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen stands at the forefront of next&#8208;generation clean energy solutions. Specifically, electrochemical water splitting represents a cutting&#8208;edge, environmentally benign approach for sustainable green hydrogen generation. The development of next&#8208;generation highly efficient electrocatalysts with high efficiency and durability is pivotal to overcome the intrinsic kinetic limitations of both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Contextually, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing to their ultrahigh surface area, tuneable nanostructures, and exceptional porosity, have emerged as a versatile class of materials for designing advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, a nickel&#8208;metal complex ( NMC ) and a nickel&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework ( NMF ) was rationally synthesized. Electrochemical analyses revealed that the NMF exhibited superior bifunctional activity, with low overpotentials of 144 mV for HER and 347 mV for OER at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline media. Remarkably, the NMF || NMF catalyst delivered a low overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.647 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , along with outstanding long&#8208;term stability. Comprehensive experimental and in silico insights confirm that NMF dramatically lowers the energy barrier for hydrogen adsorption. These findings highlight the NMF as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst, underscoring its potential to enable next&#8208;generation, advanced water electrolysis techniques for green hydrogen production.</description>

                For most organic structures, the donor-acceptor (D-A) effect can effectively regulate the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance. However, the internal correlation between the structure and charge transportation, especially at the molecular level, is insufficiently explored. Herein, Cu3(PyCA)3 (PyCA = pyrazolate-4-carboxaldehyde), tris(4-aminophenyl) amine, and [2,2'-bipyridine]-5,5'-diamine were employed to prepare two metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely, Tap-MCOF and Bpy-MCOF, both of which are D-A-type structure. In accordance, Tap-MCOF exhibits improved conversion of H2O and O2 to H2O2 in the absence of sacrificial agent, achieving the H2O2 production rate of 288.58 &#956;mol g-1 h-1, which is approximately 2.7-fold higher than that of Bpy-MCOF. It is considered due to the intensified D-A effect within Tap-MCOF, it presents a narrower band gaps and greater separation of photoinduced carriers, compared with that of Bpy-MCOF. The transient photocurrent response intensity of Tap-MCOF is significantly higher than that of Bpy-MCOF, indicating its superior charge separation and transport efficiency. These results not only provide a strategy for manipulating the carrier separation efficiency of photocatalysts at the molecular level but also furnish insights into the effective photocatalytic ORR and WOR transformations of organic semiconducting catalysts.</description>

                Abstract The development of platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free catalysts is essential to advance the wide application of fuel cells. Single&#8208;atom Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts are one type of promising PGM&#8208;free catalysts that can replace the expensive Pt/C catalyst for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. However, Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts still suffer from poor stability due to the inevitable Fenton reaction. In this work, a doping strategy is demonstrated to alter the electronic structure around the catalytic sites and significantly improve their catalytic activity. In particular, the phosphorous&#8208;doped Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalyst (P&#9472;Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C) achieves a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885 V versus RHE in 0.1 m KOH and demonstrates excellent stability, with only a 7 mV decay in the half&#8208;wave potential after 10 000 cyclic voltammetry cycles, superior to that of boron&#8208;doped one (B&#9472;Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that heteroatom doping favors the ORR process, highlighting the potential of this catalyst for advanced energy applications.</description>

                Abstract In this work, a novel synthetic strategy to construct a structurally advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst via Ar/NH 3 radio&#8208;frequency plasma&#8208;assisted nitridation and subsequent high&#8208;temperature selenization is proposed. The resulting self&#8208;supporting electrode, denoted as p&#8208;NiSe 2 /Ni@Ni 3 N/NCNT@CC, consists of selenium&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich NiSe 2 /Ni@Ni 3 N nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) in situ grown on carbon&#8208;cloth (CC). The formation of this ternary heterostructure is governed by interactions between plasma&#8208;generated reactive species (NH*, NH 2 *, Ar*) and Ni NPs. It demonstrates outstanding bifunctional performance and stability in 0.1 m KOH, featuring a half&#8208;wave potential for oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction (ORR) of 0.80 V, an overpotential of 311 mV for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) at 30 mA cm&#8315; 2 , and a minimal &#916;E of 0.74 V, surpassing commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 . Liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (L&#8208;ZABs) using this catalyst as the air cathode deliver a high peak power&#8208;density of 137.94 mW cm&#8315; 2 and stable cycling over 1 000 cycles, with minimal voltage polarization. More impressively, it serves as a competitive self&#8208;supporting electrode in flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs (ASS&#8208;ZABs), achieving 1.49 V open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV), 106.8 mW cm&#8315; 2 peak power&#8208;density, and excellent cycling and low&#8208;temperature performance. DFT calculations confirm that the enhanced activity and durability stem from the synergistic effects of heterostructure engineering, selenium vacancy modulation, and conductive carbon integration.</description>

                Abstract The development of highly efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts with minimal precious metal usage is critical for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). We present an iridium&#8211;platinum nanoalloy (IrPt) supported on lanthanum and nickel co-doped cobalt oxide, featuring a core&#8211;shell architecture with an amorphous IrPtOx shell and an IrPt core. This catalyst exhibits exceptional bifunctional activity for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in acidic media, achieving 2 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.72 V in a PEMWE device with ultralow loadings of 0.075 mg Ir cm &#8722;2 and 0.075 mg Pt cm &#8722;2 at anode and cathode, respectively. It demonstrates outstanding durability, sustaining water splitting for over 646 h with a degradation rate of only 5 &#956;V h &#8722;1 , outperforming state-of-the-art Ir-based catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory simulations reveal that the optimized charge redistribution between Ir and Pt, along with the IrPt core&#8211;IrPtOx shell structure, enhances performance. The Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Pt active sites enable a bi-nuclear mechanism for oxygen evolution reaction and a Volmer&#8211;Tafel mechanism for hydrogen evolution reaction, reducing kinetic barriers. Hierarchical porosity, abundant oxygen vacancies, and a high electrochemical surface area further improve electron and mass transfer. This work offers a cost-effective solution for green hydrogen production and advances the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for PEMWE. Graphical Abstract</description>

                Efficient and cost-effective biosensing platforms are difficult to maintain. Recently, researchers have begun to explore the use of materials that are alternative to traditional noble metals. On this note, the present work focuses on the biosensing capabilities of nanoarchitectured copper telluride (CuTe) semiconductor thin films. The vast surface area established within the mesoporous framework facilitates effective current transfer in traditional electrolytes, rendering them highly suitable for applications in biological sensing by demonstrating their ability in glucose sensors, showing an exceptionally low detection threshold (57.38 nM) and a notable sensitivity of 682.4 &#956;A&#183;cm-2&#183;&#956;M-1, which is approximately three times higher than that of mesoporous gold (mAu) films. Our findings indicate that nanoarchitectured CuTe semiconductor thin films possess substantial potential for integration into advanced biosensing technologies, enabling possibilities for the enhanced and ultrasensitive detection of biological molecules.</description>

      <title>Carbon Capture from Natural Gas Flue Emissions and Air via (Bi)Carbonate Formation in a Cyclodextrin-Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>

                Carbon capture and utilization or sequestration (CCUS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture (DAC) are both necessary to curb the rising atmospheric levels of CO2. Amine scrubbers, the current leading carbon capture technology, suffer from poor oxidative and thermal stability, limiting their long-term cycling stability under oxygen-rich streams such as air and the emissions from natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. Herein, we demonstrate that the hydroxide-based cyclodextrin metal-organic framework (CD-MOF) Rb2CO3 CD-MOF ST possesses high CO2 capacities from dry dilute streams at low temperatures and humid streams at elevated temperatures. Additionally, it displays good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions in dynamic breakthrough experiments. Unexpectedly, under dry, hot conditions, a shift in the CO2 adsorption mechanism&#9472;from reversibly formed bicarbonate to irreversibly formed carbonate&#9472;is observed, as supported by gas sorption and spectroscopic studies coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This mechanistic switch, akin to urea formation in amine-functionalized sorbents, has not been previously reported in a hydroxide-based material and sheds new light on the interplay between bicarbonate and carbonate species during CO2 capture. Our findings provide valuable insight for the design of next-generation materials containing oxygen-based nucleophiles for carbon capture applications.</description>

      <title>Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0271350</link>
      <description>Takafumi Shiraogawa, Simon Le&#243;n Krug, Masahiro Ehara, O. Anatole von Lilienfeld, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412192731

                Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic boron nitride-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. The rules predict the electric response properties more accurately than the magnetizabilities. The electric response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power.</description>

      <title>Universally Accurate or Specifically Inadequate? Stress&#8208;Testing General Purpose Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aidi.202500031</link>

                Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the field of atomistic materials simulation, both due to their remarkable accuracy and their computational efficiency compared to established ab initio methods. Very recently, several general purpose MLIPs have been reported, which are broadly applicable across the periodic table. These represent a fascinating opportunity for materials discovery, provided that they are robust and transferable. In order to stress test current general purpose MLIPs, we evaluate the performance of M3GNet and MACE models in element&#8208;substitution based structure prediction workflows for a diverse range of inorganic, crystalline materials. Importantly, these results are compared with a full density functional based workflow, shifting the focus from merely evaluating single&#8208;point energy and force predictions of MLIPs toward an end&#8208;to&#8208;end perspective. We find that general purpose MLIPs are in general well&#8208;suited to accelerate computational materials discovery and structure prediction, but also display certain systematic biases. To address these, a simple metric to quantify MLIP reliability for materials discovery is introduced. As a by&#8208;product, we also predict novel ground state structures for 15 out of 100 analyzed compositions.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Dynamic Workflow Managers for Advancing Self&#8208;Driving Labs and Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aidi.202500067</link>
      <description>Simon Krarup Steensen, Patrick W. V. Butler, Jesper Pedersen, Nis Fisker&#8208;B&#248;dker, Tejs Vegge, Jin Hyun Chang, Ivano E. Castelli, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412109432

                In this work, we highlight the need for dynamic workflow managers in self&#8208;driving laboratories (SDLs) and optimizers for Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs). While MAPs leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to accelerate materials discovery, static workflow managers limit scalability, and flexibility. We demonstrate the benefits of modular, adaptable orchestrators by integrating PerQueue, a dynamic workflow manager, into a color&#8208;mixing robot, streamlining task coordination and AI&#8208;driven optimization. Additionally, we assess various MAP&#8208;relevant methodologies based on their maturity and readiness for integration. This assessment underlines the importance of flexible workflow managers in advancing SDLs and optimizers, paving the way for more effective future MAP implementations. Achieving seamless integration requires addressing challenges like ensuring data provenance, adhering to findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable principles, and adapting workflows to changing experimental conditions&#8212;key elements for the successful deployment of MAPs.</description>
