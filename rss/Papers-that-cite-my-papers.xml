      <title>First and Second Reductions in an Aprotic Solvent: Comparing Computational and Experimental One-Electron Reduction Potentials for 345 Quinones</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00602</link>

                Using reference reduction potentials of quinones recently measured relative to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), we benchmark absolute one-electron reduction potentials computed for 345 Q/Q&#8226;&#8211; and 265 Q&#8226;&#8211;/Q2&#8211; half-reactions using adiabatic electron affinities computed with density functional theory and solvation energies computed with four continuum solvation models: IEF-PCM, C-PCM, COSMO, and SM12. Regression analyses indicate a strong linear correlation between experimental and absolute computed Q/Q&#8226;&#8211; reduction potentials with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between 0.95 and 0.96 and the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to the linear fit between 83.29 and 89.51 mV for different solvation methods when the slope of the regression is constrained to 1. The same analysis for Q&#8226;&#8211;/Q2&#8211; gave a linear regression with r between 0.74 and 0.90 and MAE between 95.87 and 144.53 mV, respectively. The y-intercept values obtained from the linear regressions are in good agreement with the range of absolute reduction potentials reported in the literature for the SCE but reveal several sources of systematic error. The y-intercepts from Q&#8226;&#8211;/Q2&#8211; calculations are lower than those from Q/Q&#8226;&#8211; by around 320&#8211;410 mV for IEF-PCM, C-PCM, and SM12 compared to 210 mV for COSMO. Systematic errors also arise between molecules having different ring sizes (benzoquinones, naphthoquinones, and anthraquinones) and different substituents (titratable vs nontitratable). SCF convergence issues were found to be a source of random error that was slightly reduced by directly optimizing the solute structure in the continuum solvent reaction field. While SM12 MAEs were lower than those of the other solvation models for Q/Q&#8226;&#8211;, SM12 had larger MAEs for Q&#8226;&#8211;/Q2&#8211; pointing to a larger error when describing multiply charged anions in DMF. Altogether, the results highlight the advantages of, and further need for, testing computational methods using a large experimental data set that is not skewed (e.g., having more titratable than nontitratable substituents on different parent groups or vice versa) to help further distinguish between sources of random and systematic errors in the calculations.</description>

                Abstract We here introduce the Aquamarine (AQM) dataset, an extensive quantum-mechanical (QM) dataset that contains the structural and electronic information of 59,783 low-and high-energy conformers of 1,653 molecules with a total number of atoms ranging from 2 to 92 (mean: 50.9), and containing up to 54 (mean: 28.2) non-hydrogen atoms. To gain insights into the solvent effects as well as collective dispersion interactions for drug-like molecules, we have performed QM calculations supplemented with a treatment of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions of structures and properties in the gas phase and implicit water. Thus, AQM contains over 40 global and local physicochemical properties (including ground-state and response properties) per conformer computed at the tightly converged PBE0+MBD level of theory for gas-phase molecules, whereas PBE0+MBD with the modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) model of water was used for solvated molecules. By addressing both molecule-solvent and dispersion interactions, AQM dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for state-of-the-art machine learning methods for property modeling and de novo generation of large (solvated) molecules with pharmaceutical and biological relevance.</description>

      <title>Boosting electrocatalytic nitrate-to-ammonia of single Fe active sites via coordination engineering: From theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.07.055</link>
      <description>Heying Li, Xinyang Liu, Ziwang Kan, Song Liu, Jingxiang Zhao, Journal of colloid and interface science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400398824

                Atomically dispersed iron&#8211;nitrogen-carbon (Fe&#8211;N4&#8211;C) catalysts show great promises for the electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3). Nevertheless, the microenvironmental engineering of the single Fe active sites for further optimizing the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Herein, we proposed to regulate the coordination environment of single Fe active sites to boost its intrinsic electrocatalytic activity for NO3&#8722; &#8211;to&#8211;NH3 conversion by the incorporation of new heteroatoms, including B, C, O, Si, P, and S. Our results revealed that most of the candidates possess low formation energies, showing great potential for experimental synthesis. Moreover, incorporating heteroatoms effectively modulates the charge redistribution and the d&#8211;band center of single Fe active sites, enabling the regulation of the binding strength of nitrogenous intermediates. As a result, the N and C coordinated Fe active site (Fe&#8211;N3C) exhibits superior catalytic performance for NO3&#8722; electroreduction with a relatively low limiting potential (&#8211;0.13 V) due to its optimal adsorption strength with nitrogenous intermediates induced by its moderate charge and d&#8211;band center. Importantly, our experimental measures confirmed such theoretical prediction: a maximum NH3 yield rate of 21.07 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 and 95.74 % Faradaic efficiency were achieved for NO3&#8722; electroreduction on Fe&#8211;N3C catalyst. These findings not only suggest a highly efficient catalyst for nitrate reduction but also provide insight into how to design and prepare electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Electron distribution regulating of nonmetal doped monolayer g-GaN for enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.160683</link>
      <description>Yafei Zhao, Liang He, Applied surface science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400398871

                Exploring inexpensive electrocatalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels is important to promote carbon neutrality and solve the energy crisis. Current electrocatalysts, such as Cu-based alloys, single-atom catalysts, and dual-atom catalysts, use the d states of metal in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Inspired by this, this work studies CO2 reduction reaction from another approach. Herein, using first principles study, we systematically investigate the prospect of nonmetal (B, C, O and F) doped monolayers g-GaN as electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction. We found that nonmetal doping can effectively regulate the electron distribution and p-band center of the active center (N site), which can adjust the initial adsorption, activation degree, charge transfer amount of CO2, and promote the formation of intermediates. Interestingly, B and C doped systems have better catalytic activity for CH4, with limiting potentials of &#8722;0.61 and &#8722;0.53 V, respectively. More importantly, F doped system has higher activity and selectivity for CH3OH production and inhibit competitive HER, with lower limiting potentials of &#8722;0.60 V. This study provides a new theoretical basis for the design and screening of electrocatalysts with high activity and product selectivity using nonmetal as the active site.</description>

                Supported nonprecious metal catalysts such as copper (Cu) are promising replacements for Pt-based catalysts for a wide range of energy-related electrochemical reactions. Direct electrochemical deposition is one of the most straightforward and versatile methods to synthesize supported nonprecious metal catalysts. However, further advancement in the design of supported nonprecious metal catalysts requires a detailed mechanistic understanding of the interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics of the deposition phenomena under realistic reaction conditions. Here, we study the electrodeposition of Cu on carbon nanotubes and graphene derivatives under electrochemical conditions using</description>

                We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of the atomic positions scheme.</description>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have aroused extensive attention in the field of catalysis. However, due to the integration of multiple active sites in HEA, it exhibits excessive adsorption behavior resulting in difficult desorption of active species from the catalyst surfaces, which hinders the catalytic efficiency. Therefore, adjusting the adsorption strength of the active site in HEA to enhance the catalytic activity is of great importance. By introducing rare-earth (RE) elements into the high-entropy alloy, the delocalization of 4f electrons can be achieved through the interaction between the multimetal active site and RE, which benefits to regulate the adsorption strength of the HEA surface.

                High-throughput computational materials discovery has promised significant acceleration of the design and discovery of new materials for many years. Despite a surge in interest and activity, the constraints imposed by large-scale computational resources present a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, examples of very large-scale computational discovery carried out through experimental validation remain scarce, especially for materials with product applicability. Here, we demonstrate how this vision became reality by combining state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models and traditional physics-based models on cloud high-performance computing (HPC) resources to quickly navigate through more than 32 million candidates and predict around half a million potentially stable materials. By focusing on solid-state electrolytes for battery applications, our discovery pipeline further identified 18 promising candidates with new compositions and rediscovered a decade's worth of collective knowledge in the field as a byproduct. We then synthesized and experimentally characterized the structures and conductivities of our top candidates, the Na</description>

                Here, we investigated the adsorption of acetylene and ethylene on iron clusters and nanoparticles, which is a crucial aspect in the nascent phase of carbon nanotube growth by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD). The effect of sulfur on adsorption was also studied due to its indispensable role in the process and its commonly known impact on metal catalyst poisoning. We performed systematic density functional theory (DFT) computations, considering numerous adsorption configurations and iron particles of various sizes (Fe</description>

                Monolayer protected metal clusters comprise a rich class of molecular systems and are promising candidate materials for a variety of applications. While a growing number of protected nanoclusters have been synthesized and characterized in crystalline forms, their dynamical behavior in solution, including prenucleation cluster formation, is not well understood due to limitations both in characterization and first-principles modeling techniques. Recent advancements in machine-learned interatomic potentials are rapidly enabling the study of complex interactions such as dynamical behavior and reactivity on the nanoscale. Here, we develop an Au-S-C-H atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potential for efficient and accurate molecular dynamics simulations of thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters (Au</description>

      <title>Mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the active, crowded cytoplasm</title>

                The mesoscale organization of molecules into membraneless biomolecular condensates is emerging as a key mechanism of rapid spatiotemporal control in cells. Principles of biomolecular condensation have been revealed through reconstitution. However, intracellular environments are much more complex than test-tube environments: they are viscoelastic, highly crowded at the mesoscale, and are far from thermodynamic equilibrium due to the constant action of energy-consuming processes. We developed synDrops, a synthetic phase separation system, to study how the cellular environment affects condensate formation. Three key features enable physical analysis: synDrops are inducible, bioorthogonal, and have well-defined geometry. This design allows kinetic analysis of synDrop assembly and facilitates computational simulation of the process. We compared experiments and simulations to determine that macromolecular crowding promotes condensate nucleation but inhibits droplet growth through coalescence. ATP-dependent cellular activities help overcome the frustration of growth. In particular, stirring of the cytoplasm by actomyosin dynamics is the dominant mechanism that potentiates droplet growth in the mammalian cytoplasm by reducing confinement and elasticity. Our results demonstrate that mesoscale molecular assembly is favored by the combined effects of crowding and active matter in the cytoplasm. These results move toward a better predictive understanding of condensate formation . Published by the American Physical Society 2024</description>

                Abstract Designing efficient, durable, and cheap bifunctional electrocatalysts is a challenging goal in water splitting. Herein, trivanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate H 6 PV 3 Mo 9 O 40 (POM) and Fe 0.2 Ni 0.8 Co 2 O 4 (FNCO) are in situ grown onto nickel foam (NF) yielding a self&#8208;supporting nanoflower&#8208;like heterojunction via convenient hydrothermal reaction. The POM&#8208;Fe 0.2 Ni 0.8 Co 2 O 4 /NF as HER and OER electrocatalyst, displays low overpotential (89 and 259 mV) and high electrode stability at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . POM&#8208;FNCO/NF as the cathode and anode requires a lower voltage (1.58 V) to provide 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for overall water splitting (OWS), which is better than that of commercial catalysts. The electronic sponge characteristics of POM provide more active sites and fast reaction kinetics for HER and OER. The synergy of POM and FNCO optimizes the electron distribution at the interface and enhances the intrinsic activity of HER/OER. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations show that water molecules preferentially bind to Co sites on POM&#8208;FNCO. Additionally, POM has proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer properties and its modified FNCO exhibits thermodynamic advantages. The synergistic effect of these two factors enables the efficient overall water splitting of POM&#8208;FNCO. This study offers a novel pathway for the construction of self&#8208;supporting efficient catalysts by in situ growth of POM nanoclusters and spinel oxide sub&#8208;nanometer heterojunctions on NF.</description>

                The surface roughness of metal nanoparticles is known to be influential toward their properties, but the quantification of surface roughness is challenging. Given the recent availability of large&#8208;scale simulated data and tools for the computation of the box&#8208;counting dimension of simulated atomistic objects, researchers are now enabled to study the connections between the surface roughness of metal nanoparticles and their properties. Herein, the relationships between the fractal box&#8208;counting dimension of metal nanoparticle surfaces and structural features relevant to experimental and computational studies are investigated, providing actionable insights for the manufacturing of rough nanoparticles. This approach differs from conventional concepts of roughness, but introduces a possible indicator for their functionalities such as catalytic performance that was not previously accessible. It is found that, while it remains difficult to consistently correlate the dimension with the catalytic activity of surface facets, matching trends with their surface energy, thermodynamic stability, and number of bond vacancy are observed. This highlights the potential of fractal box&#8208;counting dimensions to rationalize catalytic activity trends among metal nanoparticles, and opens up opportunities for the design of nanocatalysts with better performance via surface engineering.</description>

                MiMiC is a framework for performing multiscale simulations in which loosely coupled external programs describe individual subsystems at different resolutions and levels of theory. To make it highly efficient and flexible, we adopt an interoperable approach based on a multiple-program multiple-data (MPMD) paradigm, serving as an intermediary responsible for fast data exchange and interactions between the subsystems. The main goal of MiMiC is to avoid interfering with the underlying parallelization of the external programs, including the operability on hybrid architectures (e.g., CPU/GPU), and keep their setup and execution as close as possible to the original. At the moment, MiMiC offers an efficient implementation of electrostatic embedding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) that has demonstrated unprecedented parallel scaling in simulations of large biomolecules using CPMD and GROMACS as QM and MM engines, respectively. However, as it is designed for high flexibility with general multiscale models in mind, it can be straightforwardly extended beyond QM/MM. In this article, we illustrate the software design and the features of the framework, which make it a compelling choice for multiscale simulations in the upcoming era of exascale high-performance computing.</description>

                Estimating the potential energy of a molecular system at a quantum level of theory is a task of paramount importance in computational chemistry. The often employed density functional theory approach allows one to accomplish this task, yet most often at significant computational costs. This prompted the community to develop so-called machine learning potentials to achieve near-quantum accuracy at molecular mechanics computational cost. In this paper, we introduce OBIWAN, a feed-forward neural network that bears some relevant structural properties that also led to the definition of a new kind of general-purpose neural network layer. Its featurization process scales efficiently with newly added atomic species. This allows one to seamlessly add new atom types without requiring to change the topology of the network. Also, this allows one to train on new data sets leveraging a previously trained OBIWAN, hence converging very quickly. This avoids training from scratch and renders the approach more compliant with a green computing perspective.</description>
