      <title>The Role of Cu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in the Oxygen Evolution Activity of Copper Oxides</title>

                Cu-based oxides and hydroxides represent an important class of materials from a catalytic and corrosion perspective. In this study, we investigate the formation of bulk and surface Cu3+ species that are stable under water oxidation catalysis in alkaline media. So far, no direct evidence existed for the presence of hydroxides (CuOOH) or oxides, which were primarily proposed by theory. This work directly places CuOOH in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) Pourbaix stability region with a calculated free energy of -208.68 kJ/mol, necessitating a revision of known Cu-H2O phase diagrams. We also predict that the active sites of CuOOH for the OER are consistent with a bridge O* site between the two Cu3+ atoms with onset at &#8805;1.6 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), aligning with experimentally observed Cu2+/3+ oxidation waves in cyclic voltammetry of Fe-free and Fe-spiked copper in alkaline media. Trace amounts of Fe (2 &#956;g/mL (ppm) to 5 &#956;g/mL) in the solution measurably enhance the catalytic activity of the OER, likely due to the adsorption of Fe species that serve as the active sites . Importantly, modulation excitation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ME-XAS) of a Cu thin-film electrode shows a distinct Cu3+ fingerprint under OER conditions at 1.8 V vs RHE. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy of polycrystalline Cu in 0.1 mol/L (M) KOH revealed features consistent with those calculated for CuOOH in addition to CuO. Overall, this work provides direct evidence of bulk electrochemical Cu3+ species under OER conditions and expands our longstanding understanding of the oxidation mechanism and catalytic activity of copper.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser-induced diffusion and desorption of CO adsorbed on a weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling surface: Cu(110)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0256832</link>
      <description>Federico J. Gonzalez, Alberto S. Muzas, J. I. Juaristi, M. Alducin, H. F. Busnengo, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(17)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410005931

                In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CO molecules chemisorbed on Cu(110) under femtosecond laser irradiation. We use the two temperature model and a previously developed potential energy surface based on density functional theory total energies (obtained using the nonlocal vdW-DF2 functional) and parameterized using artificial neural networks. We find that laser irradiation induces diffusion parallel to [1&#772;10] much more efficiently than parallel to [001] due to a significantly smaller energy barrier in the former case (i.e., 0.12 vs 0.49 eV). We also observe photoinduced desorption (an endothermic process characterized by &#916;E = 0.6 eV) with a probability that exhibits a power law dependence with laser fluence. At the lowest fluence studied (F = 30 J m-2), for which experimental data are available, the theoretical photoinduced diffusion probabilities both parallel and perpendicular to [1&#772;10] agree with the measured values, whereas our calculations predict desorption probabilities smaller than those obtained in experiments. Our MD simulations show that (i) the energy exchange with the hot electron bath is the main responsible for photoinduced processes and (ii) phonons tend to reduce the kinetic energy of the adsorbate, as keeping fixed the position of the Cu atoms during the simulations (thereby quenching CO-phonon energy exchange) significantly increases CO diffusion and desorption probabilities. Thus, our study advances the understanding of ultrafast surface dynamics on metal surfaces with weak electron-phonon coupling, and we hope that it will motivate further experimental investigations.</description>

                In recent years, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become indispensable tools in physics, chemistry, and materials science, driving the development of software packages for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and related applications. These packages, typically built on specific machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX, face integration challenges when advanced applications demand communication across different frameworks. The previous TensorFlow-based implementation of the DeePMD-kit exemplified these limitations. In this work, we introduce DeePMD-kit version 3, a significant update featuring a multibackend framework that supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and PaddlePaddle backends, and demonstrate the versatility of this architecture through the integration of other MLP packages and of differentiable molecular force fields. This architecture allows seamless back-end switching with minimal modifications, enabling users and developers to integrate DeePMD-kit with other packages using different machine learning frameworks. This innovation facilitates the development of more complex and interoperable workflows, paving the way for broader applications of MLPs in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of single-atom catalysts for CO2 reduction considering the pH-dependency at the reversible hydrogen electrode scale</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0267969</link>
      <description>Yue Chu, Yuhang Wang, Di Zhang, Xuedan Song, Chang Yu, Hao Li, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 162(17)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410045038

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) represents a promising approach to mitigating climate change and addressing energy challenges by converting CO2 into value-added chemicals. Among various CO2RR products, CO is attractive due to its economic viability and industrial relevance. By integrating large-scale data mining (with 939 experimental performance data), we reveal that the catalytic performance of d-block transition metal-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) for CO2RR is influenced not only by the coordination environment but also significantly by pH. However, the unified model that could accurately depict the pH-dependent CO2RR to CO activity of d-block SACs is urgently needed. Herein, we conducted pH-dependent microkinetic modeling based upon density functional theory calculations and pH-electric field coupled microkinetic modeling to analyze CO2RR performance of 101 SACs. Our data-driven screening identifies 12 high-performance SACs with promising CO selectivity across different pH conditions, primarily based on Fe, Cu, and Ni centers. We establish a scaling relation between key intermediates (*COOH and *CO) and analyze their adsorption behaviors under varying electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, our pH-dependent microkinetic modeling reveals the critical role of electric field effects in determining catalytic performance, aligning well with experimental turnover frequency values. Most importantly, our theoretical model accurately captures the pH-dependent performance of CO2RR-to-CO on d-block SACs, which is experimentally validated and serves as a general theoretical framework for the rational design of high-performance CO2RR catalysts. Based on this model, we identify a series of promising M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, providing a universal design principle for optimizing CO2-to-CO conversion.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study on Direct Z-Scheme SnC/SnS2 Heterostructures for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemistry7030076</link>
      <description>Sisi Zhou, Yuliang Mao, Chemistry. 7(3)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410069172

                Direct Z-scheme heterojunctions are known for their unique carrier mobility mechanism, which significantly improves photocatalytic water splitting efficiency. In this study, we use first-principles simulations to determine the stability, electrical, and photocatalytic properties of a SnC/SnS2 heterojunction. Analyses of the projected energy band and state density demonstrate that the SnC/SnS2 heterojunction exhibits an indirect band gap of 0.80 eV and a type-II band alignment. Analysis of its work function shows that the SnC/SnS2 heterojunction has a built-in electric field pointing from the SnC monolayer to the SnS2 monolayer. The band edge position and the differential charge density indicate that the SnC/SnS2 heterostructure exhibits a Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the SnC/SnS2 heterojunction exhibits excellent visible-light absorption and high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 32.8%. It is found that the band gap and light absorption of the heterojunction can be effectively tuned by biaxial strain. These results demonstrate that the fabricated SnC/SnS2 heterojunction has significant photocatalysis potential.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Mechanisms in Magneto&#8208;Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202412852</link>
      <description>Amy Radford, Dorottya Szalay, Qiming Chen, Mengfan Ying, Mingyu Luo, Xuelei Pan, Michail Stamatakis, Yiyang Li, Chen Wu, Shik Chi Edman Tsang, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410035834

                Abstract External magnetic fields emerge as a promising method for enhancing the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the underlying magneto&#8208;electric (ME) mechanisms are not well understood. The slow kinetics of OER make it a key challenge in electrocatalytic water&#8208;splitting, a promising technique for sustainable H 2 fuel production. Herein, a systematic approach is presented to analyzing the ME mechanisms governing OER, using metallic&#8208;plate (Ni foam, Ni sheet, and Pt sheet) and powder&#8208;based (Co 3 O 4 /BaFe 12 O 19 on carbon paper) electrodes. Through controlled experiments using varying magnetic field strengths and orientations, Lorentz force and spin&#8208;polarization mechanisms are separated. For metallic electrodes, the effects are orientation&#8208;dependent, indicating domination by Lorentz force. Magnetic flux density about the electrode surface is shown to govern the Lorentz force behavior. Interestingly, a &#8220;pseudo&#8221; effect is discovered which results from the relative position of the reference electrode, highlighting the importance of experimental design. The Co 3 O 4 systems display minimal orientation dependence, indicating spin&#8208;polarization domination. Introducing BaFe 12 O 19 as a magnetic co&#8208;catalyst further amplifies the ME effect, marking the first demonstration of magnetic co&#8208;catalyst enhancement in magneto&#8208;electrocatalysis. This work provides key insights into ME mechanisms, linking electrode composition, magnetism, and geometry to performance, offering new pathways for optimizing future magneto&#8208;electrocatalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Atomic Energy Accuracy of Neural Network Potentials: Harnessing Pretraining and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00079</link>
      <description>Gang Seob Jung, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410076782

                Machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have transformed the prediction of potential energy surfaces (PESs), achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio calculations. However, atomic energy predictions, often assumed to lack physical meaning, remain underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that inaccuracies in atomic energy predictions reduce the robustness and transferability of Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) and atomic energy error can be masked in total energy predictions due to error cancellation. We validate this finding using challenging configurations involving deformation and failure under tensile loading. By pretraining atomic energy predictions using empirical potentials and applying transfer learning with density functional theory (DFT) data, we achieve notable improvements in the accuracy of total energy, forces, and stress predictions. Furthermore, this approach enhances the robustness and transferability of NNPs, emphasizing the importance of atomic energy predictions in developing high-quality and reliable MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Integrated Strategies Toward the Capture and Electrochemical Conversion of Low&#8208;Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>

                ABSTRACT Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been considered a promising route to reduce net carbon emissions and thus mitigate global warming issues. In practice, it mainly involves two processes including the CO 2 capture and subsequent electrochemical conversion. From the perfective of feasible and economic benefits, it is of practical significance to develop integrated CO 2 capture and conversion systems in an efficient way. However, a majority of studies have been currently focusing on the independent process, and the development of integrated strategies is still in the initial stage. This review mainly covers the recent progress on the integrated technologies of CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, including the integration strategies, mechanisms, and corresponding issues. The advantages and disadvantages of those strategies are particularly discussed, aiming to identify the viable routes for future applications. To conclude, the challenges and prospects in terms of the research direction in this field are provided, with the hope of promoting practical CO 2 utilization from the fundamental aspects.</description>
