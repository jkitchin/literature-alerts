      <title>Understanding Pt Active Sites on Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanocages for Industrial Hydrogen Evolution with Ultralow Pt Usage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c11445</link>
      <description>Jingyi Tian, Minqi Xia, Xueyi Cheng, Chenghui Mao, Yiqun Chen, Yan Zhang, Changkai Zhou, Fengfei Xu, Lijun Yang, Xizhang Wang, Qiang Wu, Zheng Hu, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404681858

                Engineering microstructures of Pt and understanding the related catalytic mechanism are critical to optimizing the performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Pt dispersion and coordination are precisely regulated on hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (hNCNCs) by a thermal-driven Pt migration, from edge-hosted Pt&#8211;N2Cl2 single sites in the initial Pt1/hNCNC-70 &#176;C catalyst to Pt clusters/nanoparticles and back to in-plane Pt&#8211;NxC4&#8211;x single sites. Thereinto, Pt&#8211;N2Cl2 presents the optimal HER activity (6 mV@10 mA cm&#8211;2) while Pt&#8211;NxC4&#8211;x shows poor HER activity (321 mV@10 mA cm&#8211;2) due to their different Pt coordination. Operando characterizations demonstrate that the low-coordinated Pt&#8211;N2 intermediates derived from Pt&#8211;N2Cl2 under the working condition are the real active sites for HER, which enable the multi-H adsorption mechanism with an ideal H* adsorption energy of nearly 0 eV, thereby the high activity, as revealed by theoretical calculations. In contrast, the high-coordinated Pt&#8211;NxC4&#8211;x sites only allow the single-H adsorption with a positive adsorption energy and thereby the low HER activity. Accordingly, with an ultralow Pt loading of only 25 &#956;gPt cm&#8211;2, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer assembled using Pt1/hNCNC-70 &#176;C as the cathodic catalyst achieves an industrial-level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8211;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.66 V and high durability, showing great potential applications.</description>

                Coordination structure and group modifications of single-atom catalysts are essential for regulating superficial electronic structures and reaction activities. Epoxy group-modified single-atom Co-N-C configuration demonstrates exceptional catalytic performance for hydrogen peroxide production. Through the manipulation of the coordination structure of Co-N-C and the doped epoxy groups, we elucidate the origin of catalytic activity in epoxygroup-modified Co-N-C configurations. Theoretical results indicate that the second coordination sphere of the Co-N-C structure is essential for the regulation of the two-electron pathway by the epoxy groups acting as cocatalysts. This cocatalytic mechanism originates from hydrogen bonding interactions between the epoxy groups and the OOH intermediates. Three epoxy groups within the second coordination sphere of Co-N-C configuration lead to the achievement of the optimal</description>

      <title>General-purpose neural network potential for Ti-Al-Nb alloys towards large-scale molecular dynamics with &lt;i&gt;ab initio&lt;/i&gt; accuracy</title>

      <description>Zhiqiang Zhao, Min Yi, Wanlin Guo, Zhuhua Zhang, Physical review. B./Physical review. B. 110(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404693962

                High Nb-containing TiAl alloys exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength and room-temperature ductility, making them widely used in hot-section components of automotive and aerospace engines. However, the lack of accurate interatomic interaction potential for large-scale modeling severely hampers a comprehensive understanding of the failure mechanism of Ti-Al-Nb alloys and the development of strategies to enhance the mechanical properties. Here, we develop a general-purpose machine-learned potential (MLP) for the Ti-Al-Nb ternary system by combining the neural evolution potential framework with an active learning scheme. The developed MLP, trained on extensive first-principles datasets, demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting various lattice and defect properties as well as high-temperature characteristics such as thermal expansion and melting point for TiAl systems. Notably, this potential can effectively describe the key effect of Nb doping on stacking fault energies and formation energies. Of practical importance is that our MLP enables large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving tens of millions of atoms with ab initio accuracy, achieving an outstanding balance between computational speed and accuracy. These results pave the way for elucidating micromechanical behaviors and failure mechanism TiAl lamellar structures and developing high-performance TiAl alloys towards applications at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>An Automated Pynta-based Curriculum for ML-Accelerated Calculation of Transition States</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-7d1z1</link>
      <description>Trevor Price, Saurabh Sivakumar, Matthew Johnson, Judit Z&#225;dor, Ambarish Kulkarni, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404697307

                Microkinetic models (MKMs) are widely used within the computational heterogeneous catalysis community to investigate complex reaction mechanisms, rationalize experimental trends, and to accelerate the rational design of novel catalysts. However, constructing these models requires computationally expensive and manually tedious density functional theory (DFT) calculations for identifying transition states for each elementary reaction within the MKM. To address these challenges we demonstrate a novel protocol that uses the open-source kinetics workflow tool Pynta to automate the iterative training of a reactive machine learning potential (rMLP). Specifically, using the silver-catalyzed partial oxidation of methanol as a prototypical example, we first demonstrate our workflow by training an rMLP to accelerate the parallel calculation of DFT-quality transition states for all 53 reactions, achieving a 7x speedup compared to a DFT-only strategy. Detailed analysis of our training curriculum reveals the shortcomings of using an adaptive sampling scheme with a single rMLP model to describe all reactions within the MKM simultaneously. We show that these limitations can be overcome using a balanced "reaction class" approach that uses multiple rMLP models, each describing a single class of similar transition states. Finally, we demonstrate that our Pynta-based workflow is also compatible with large pre-trained foundational models. For example, by fine-tuning a top-performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, we observe an impressive 20x speedup with an 89\% success rate in identifying transition states. This work highlights the synergistic potential of integrating automated tools with machine learning to advance catalysis research.</description>

      <title>Emerging Carbon-Based Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Insights into Mechanisms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/inorganics12120303</link>

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as a key electrode process in fuel cells and metal-air batteries, plays a pivotal role in advancing clean energy technologies. However, the slow kinetics and high overpotential of the ORR significantly limit the efficiency of these energy devices. Therefore, the development of efficient, stable, and cost-effective ORR catalysts has become a central focus of current research. Carbon-based catalysts, with their excellent conductivity, chemical stability, and tunable structural features, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional precious metal catalysts. Nevertheless, challenges remain in the design of active sites, the tuning of electronic structures, and the large-scale synthesis of carbon-based catalysts. This review systematically introduces the fundamental mechanisms and key factors influencing the ORR, providing an analysis of the critical variables that affect catalyst performance. Furthermore, it summarizes several common methods for synthesizing carbon-based catalysts, including pyrolysis, deposition, and ball milling. Following this, the review categorizes and discusses the latest advancements in metal-free carbon-based catalysts, single-atom and dual-atom catalysts, as well as metal-based nanoparticle catalysts, with a particular focus on their mechanisms for enhancing the ORR performance. Finally, the current state of research on carbon-based ORR catalysts is summarized, and future development directions are proposed, emphasizing the optimization of active sites, improvements in catalyst stability, and potential strategies for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Topological semimetals with intrinsic chirality as spin-controlling electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for clean hydrogen production, but the process is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the spin-dependent electron transfer process. Efforts to control spin through chirality and magnetization have shown potential in enhancing OER performance. Here we harnessed the potential of topological chiral semimetals (RhSi, RhSn and RhBiS) and their spin-polarized Fermi surfaces to promote the spin-dependent electron transfer in the OER, addressing the traditional volcano-plot limitations. We show that OER activities follow the trend RhSi &lt; RhSn &lt; RhBiS, corresponding to the increasing extent of spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). The chiral single crystals outperform achiral counterparts (RhTe 2 , RhTe and RuO 2 ) in alkaline electrolyte, with RhBiS exhibiting a specific activity two orders of magnitude higher than RuO 2 . Our work reveals the pivotal roles of chirality and SOC in spin-dependent catalysis, facilitating the design of ultra-efficient chiral catalysts.</description>

      <title>Manipulating C-C coupling pathway in electrochemical CO2 reduction for selective ethylene and ethanol production over single-atom alloy catalyst</title>

                Manipulation C-C coupling pathway is of great importance for selective CO2 electroreduction but remain challenging. Herein, two model Cu-based catalysts, by modifying Cu nanowires with Ag nanoparticles (AgCu NW) and Ag single atoms (Ag1Cu NW), respectively, are rationally designed for exploring the C-C coupling mechanisms in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Compared to AgCu NW, the Ag1Cu NW exhibits a more than 10-fold increase of C2 selectivity in CO2 reduction to ethanol, with ethanol-to-ethylene ratio increased from 0.41 over AgCu NW to 4.26 over Ag1Cu NW. Via a variety of operando/in-situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the enhanced ethanol selectivity over Ag1Cu NW is attributed to the promoted H2O dissociation over the atomically dispersed Ag sites, which effectively accelerated *CO hydrogenation to form *CHO intermediate and facilitated asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling over paired Cu atoms adjacent to single Ag atoms. Results of this work provide deep insight into the C-C coupling pathways towards target C2+ product and shed light on the rational design of efficient CO2RR catalysts with paired active sites. Manipulating the carbon-carbon coupling pathway in CO2 electroreduction is vital yet challenging. Here, by studying two model copper-based catalysts with distinct ethylene and ethanol selectivity, authors investigate the mechanistic origins for symmetric and asymmetric carbon-carbon coupling.</description>

                The catalytic hydrogen transfer (CHT) cascade reaction coupling alcohols with nitro compounds to synthesize imines is highly significant due to its remarkable efficiency and atom economy. However, the complicated multistep reaction process makes single-site catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance for the CHT cascade reaction. Herein, inspired by the findings of DFT calculations that Co nanocluster (CoNC) and Co single atom (CoSA) can act as the optimal active sites for alcohol oxidation and nitro reduction, respectively, one dual-active site catalyst (CoSA-CoNC/CN), containing CoSA and CoNC sites, was synthesized by a two-step vacuum pyrolysis strategy. Benefiting from the relay-like tandem catalysis of CoNC and CoSA, CoSA-CoNC/CN achieved an impressive 93% nitrobenzene conversion and 99% imine selectivity at 160 &#176;C in 4 h, with a record turnover frequency of 20.9 h&#8211;1. This work provides insights into the functions of single-atom and nanocluster active sites in the CHT cascade reaction and sheds light on the rational preparation of tandem catalysts.</description>

                To design new materials and understand their novel phenomena, it is imperative to predict the structure and properties of materials that often rely on first-principles theory. However, such methods are computationally demanding and limited to small systems. This topical review investigates machine learning (ML) approaches, specifically non-parametric sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR), to model the potential energy surface (PES) of materials, while starting from the basics of ML methods for a comprehensive review. SGPR can efficiently represent PES with minimal ab initio data, significantly reducing the computational costs by bypassing the need for inverting massive covariance matrices. SGPR rank reduction accelerates density functional theory calculations by orders of magnitude, enabling accelerated simulations. An optimal adaptive sampling algorithm is utilized for on-the-fly regression with molecular dynamics, extending to interatomic potentials through scalable SGPR formalism. Through merging quantum mechanics with ML methods, the universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential can create a digital-twin capable of predicting phenomena arising from static and dynamic changes as well as inherent and collective characteristics of materials. These techniques have been applied successfully to materials such as solid electrolytes, lithium-ion batteries, electrocatalysts, solar cells, and macromolecular systems, reproducing their structures, energetics, dynamics, properties, phase-changes, materials performance, and device efficiency. This review discusses the built-in library universal first-principles SGPR-based ML potential, showcasing its applications and successes, offering insights into the development of future ML potentials and their applications in advanced materials, catering to both educational and expert readers.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic mechanism for overall water splitting to produce sustainable hydrogen by 2D Janus MoSH monolayer</title>

                Abstract In the present work, we investigates the potential of two dimensional (2D) Janus MoSH monolayer as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting using first-principles calculations. Our results shows that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits excellent structural stability and electronic properties, which are essential for efficient electrocatalysis. We find that the charge transfer mechanism between Mo and S atoms plays a crucial role in the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer. Due to the asymmetric structure of MoSH monolayer, it has intrinsic electric field with dipole moment of 0.24 D. Moreover, we demonstrate that 2D Janus MoSH monolayer exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential 0.04 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential 0.11 V, making it a promising candidate for overall water splitting. Our findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of 2D monolayered materials for renewable energy production. By providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of HER and OER on 2D Janus MoSH monolayer, our study paves the way for the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalysts for water splitting. We hope that current work will be helpful in understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism of 2D Janus MoSH monolayer and its potential applications in renewable energy production.</description>

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;efficiency, and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. However, the sluggish HER kinetics and unsatisfied stability remain critical challenges for their practical applications. Herein, a hierarchically porous phosphorized Pt&#8208;Ni nanohexapod/N&#8208;doped graphene aerogel (P&#8208;PtNiNH/NGA) constructed by an oxidation&#8208;phosphorization&#8208;controlled reconfiguration strategy is presented. It enables fast water dissociation kinetics for an abundant supply of hydrogen ions, strong electron interaction for optimal intermediate adsorption, and an excellent anchoring effect of the NGA to avoid the aggregation and Ostwald ripening of the PtNiNHs, thus exhibiting superior activity and exceptional stability toward alkaline HER. The P&#8208;Pt 1 Ni 2 NH/NGA exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 15 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec &#8722;1 , and long&#8208;term stability, which are superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the P&#8208;Pt 1 Ni 2 NH/NGA shows a high mass activity of 13.4 mA &#181;g &#8722;1 and a large TOF value of 13.5 s &#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100 mV, which are 8.8 times and 9.0 times higher than commercial Pt/C (under the same Pt loading of &#8776;9.1 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 ). This work is of high inspiration for catalyst design to obtain ideal alkaline HER performance.</description>

                Abstract In recent years, renewable energy sources, which aim to replace rapidly depleting fossil fuels, face challenges due to limited energy storage and conversion technologies. To enhance energy storage and conversion efficiency, extensive research has been conducted in the academic community on numerous potential materials. Among these materials, metal fluorides have attracted significant attention due to their ionic metal&#8211;fluorine bonds and tunable electronic structures, attributed to the highest electronegativity of fluorine in their chemical composition. This makes them promising candidates for future electrochemical applications in various fields. However, metal fluorides encounter various challenges in different application directions. Therefore, we comprehensively review the applications of metal fluorides in the field of energy storage and conversion, aiming to deepen our understanding of their exhibited characteristics in different electrochemical processes. In this paper, we summarize the difficulties and improvement methods encountered in different types of battery applications and several typical electrode optimization strategies in the field of supercapacitors. In the field of water electrolysis, we focus on surface reconstruction and the critical role of fluorine, demonstrating the catalytic performance of metal fluorides from the perspectives of reconstruction mechanism and process analysis. Finally, we provide a summary and outlook for this field, aiming to offer guidance for future breakthroughs in the energy storage and conversion applications of metal fluorides.</description>

                The simulation of chemical reactions or processes provides a fundamental approach to understanding chemistry.The application of Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) (Kohn &amp; Sham, 1965) has become an indispensable tool for computational modeling.However, semilocal KS-DFT often fails to accurately describe long-range correlation effects, such as dispersion interactions, in many exchange-correlation functionals (Stefan Grimme et al., 2016).Additive dispersion corrections, like the D3 (S.Grimme et al., 2010) or D4 (Caldeweyher et al., 2019) methods, effectively account for these effects.</description>

      <title>Identifying key intermediates for the oxygen evolution reaction on hematite using ab-initio molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>Shuai Xu, Jiarui Yang, Peixian Su, Li Wang, Xiaowei Yang, Zhaohui Zhou, Yuliang Li, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404849149

                Hematite is a well-known catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction on photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water-splitting cells. However, the knowledge of hematite-water interfaces and water oxidation mechanisms is still lacking, which limits improvements in photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance. Herein, we use the Fe-terminated hematite (0001) surface as a model and propose a comprehensive mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction on both non-solvated and solvated surfaces. Key reaction intermediates are identified through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at the density functional theory level with a Hubbard U correction. Several notable intermediates are proposed, and the effects of water solvent on these intermediates and the overall reaction mechanisms are suggested. The proposed mechanisms align well with experimental observations under photoelectrochemical water oxidation conditions. Additionally, we highlight the potential role of O2 desorption in the oxygen evolution reaction on hematite, as O2 adsorption may block reaction sites and increases surface hydrophobicity, leading to an unfavorable pathway for oxygen evolution. Hematite is a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting, but its mechanisms are not well understood. Here, the authors report a detailed mechanism, identifying key reaction intermediates and highlighting the influence of solvent water and oxygen desorption on the reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Comparative Analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Absorption Columns in Electrochemical and Thermochemical Carbon Capture Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c01523</link>

                Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process; however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for techno-economic and engineering analyses.</description>

      <title>Catechol-derived Mannich bases: radical regulatory properties, cytotoxicity and interaction with biomolecules</title>

      <description>Maxim Y. Gvozdev, Iveta S. Turomsha, Natalia V. Loginova, E. Yu. Varfolomeeva, R. A. Kovalev, N. D. Fedorova, &#1043;. &#1040;. &#1050;&#1089;&#1077;&#1085;&#1076;&#1079;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, N.P. Osipovich, &#1056;. &#1051;. &#1057;&#1074;&#1077;&#1088;&#1076;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074;, Free Radical Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404790404

                Free radicals are ubiquitous in biological systems, being responsible for pathogenesis of degenerative diseases and participating in vitally important biochemical processes, which are mediated by radical regulatory agents. The effects of the aliphatic amine substituents in the catechol-derived Mannich bases on their antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity were investigated. It has been found that the presence of catechol moiety in the structure of Mannich bases allows them to act as Cu(II) reductants, efficient Fe(II) chelators and potent DPPH radical scavengers. It has been found that the plausible mechanism of the DPPH radical scavenging proceeds via quinone formation, followed by their interaction with ethanol via the Michael addition reaction. In the neutrophil respiratory burst assay, several compounds have demonstrated a weak antioxidant activity at the micromolar level (0.1&#8211;10 &#181;M), whereas at the millimolar level (0.1 m&#1052;) a strong pro-oxidant effect has been observed. Additionally, at the highest used concentrations a pronounced cytotoxicity against dermal fibroblasts DF-2 and an immunosuppressive effect against T-lymphocytes have been observed for all the synthesized compounds. It has been demonstrated that the oxidation of catechols in the presence of low-molecular thiols results in the formation of covalent adducts, which provides an insight into their cytotoxicity and detoxification pathways.</description>
