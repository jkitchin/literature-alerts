      <title>Unveiling the Effect of Shape Anisotropy of Plasmonic Tungsten Oxide Nanostructures for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

                Platinum is the most efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, the lack of earth abundance and high cost restrict its widespread use. Herein, we report electrocatalytic HER efficacy of oxygen-deficient, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-active tungsten-oxide (WO3&#8211;x) nanocrystals (NCs) as a function of free conduction electron density and metal oxidation states. These plasmonic, anisotropic WO3&#8211;x NCs display &#8764;160 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 54 mV/dec. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopic measurements support the HER electrocatalytic properties attributed to the Fermi energy pinning as a function of the NC shape (i.e., nanowires, nanorods, and nanoplatelets) and chemical composition of the inorganic WO3&#8211;x lattice. Furthermore, our experimental data show that increasing the number of coordinatively unsaturated tungsten sites, which are generated from the ionization of surface oxygen atoms in WO3&#8211;x NCs, improves the surface reactivity and thus, enhances the catalytic performance. Together, structure&#8211;property relationship delineating the NC morphology and the resulting optoelectronic properties studied here provide the opportunity to unravel the correlation between the NC shape, free conduction electron density and the HER kinetics of this unique class of NC and to potentially initiate the designer principle of noble metal-free, highly active, but not limited to HER catalysts to produce an energy-dense fuel.</description>

      <title>Wood&#8208;Inspired Electrode for Sustainable Electrocatalytic Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smm2.1326</link>
      <description>Weijia Guo, Yawen Wang, Shunyu Shen, Han Wang, Kai Shao, Zhenjie Wang, Yao Shi, Caicai Li, Qingfeng Sun, Huiqiao Li, SmartMat. 6(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406101616

                ABSTRACT Electrocatalysis plays a central role in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems, providing a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. As a green, renewable, and abundant natural polymer material, the unique structure and physicochemical properties of wood and its derivatives provide a unique application advantage in the field of electrocatalysis, which has aroused intense attention from researchers. At present, researchers have developed many wood&#8208;based catalytic electrodes by taking advantage of the anisotropic hierarchical porous structure of wood and abundant active functional groups on the cell wall surface of wood. Here, a comprehensive review of recent progress in the design and synthesis of wood&#8208;inspired electrodes for electrocatalytic reactions is summarized. Starting from the role and importance of the electrocatalytic process in the whole energy conversion system, this review highlights the composition and structure of wood, analyzes the mechanisms of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and discusses the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the structural properties and electrochemical activity of wood&#8208;inspired electrodes. Finally, the opportunities, challenges, and future directions in the application of wood and its derivatives in the field of electrocatalysis are prospected.</description>

      <title>NiMo-C Coatings Synthesized by Reactive Magnetron Sputtering for Application as a Catalyst for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in an Acidic Environment</title>

                This study examines the structure and properties of NiMo-C coatings synthesized via reactive magnetron sputtering of a NiMo alloy target in an argon/acetylene atmosphere. The coating structure evolves with carbon content from nanocrystalline, through amorphous to quasi-amorphous with a nanocolumnar structure. The nanostructure consists of metallic columns perpendicular to the substrate surrounded by an amorphous carbon shell. The coatings are evaluated for their potential use as catalytic materials in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic environment. The medium carbon content coatings show optimal properties in this direction, i.e., high corrosion resistance in an acidic environment and good HER performance described by the Tafel slope and characteristic overpotentials. Even at the highest carbon content, 74 at. %, the Tafel slope does not increase substantially, which is more likely attributable to the distinctive nanocolumnar structure, ensuring the presence of catalytic centers in the form of metallic islands on the surface. At the highest current densities applied, a weak but visible correlation is observed between the characteristic overpotentials and the contact angle hysteresis derived from the wettability measurements.</description>

      <title>Superatoms as Superior Catalysts: ZrO versus Pd</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202409289</link>
      <description>Mehmet Emin K&#305;l&#305;&#231;, P. Jena, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406112104

                Single-atom catalysts are the focus of studies for over a decade due to their enhanced reactivity at smaller sizes. However, they have limitations as they offer only one active site, which may not be sufficient for reactions requiring the co-adsorption of multiple reactants. Additionally, atoms can migrate on a substrate and coalesce, resulting in decreased reactivity. Here, an alternate path, a single-superatom catalyst is provided. Superatoms are clusters of atoms that mimic the chemistry of atoms even if they do not contain a single atom whose chemistry they mimic. Motivated by an experimental paper on the photoelectron-spectroscopy of negatively charged ions where ZrO is found to mimic properties of a Pd atom, first the reaction of Pd and ZrO with small molecules in the gas-phase is studied and found that ZrO not only mimics the chemistry of Pd, but is able to activate these molecules more strongly than Pd.

                Abstract The bi&#8208;transition&#8208;metal interstitial compounds (BTMICs) are promising for water electrolysis. The previous BTMICs are usually composed of irregular particles. Here, this work shows the synthesis of novel 1D Co 6 Mo 6 C&#8208;based heterojunction nanowires (1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C) with diameters about 50 nm and a length&#8208;to&#8208;diameter ratio about 20 for efficient water electrolysis. An interesting growth process based on pyrolytically &#8220;squeezing&#8221; PMo 12 (Phosphomolybdic acid)/ZIF&#8208;67 (Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;67) cube precursor is demonstrated. The &#8220;squeezing&#8221; growth is related to the role of Mo species for isolating Co species. A series of tests and theoretical calculation show the mutual regulation of Co and Mo to optimize the electronic structure, accelerating H 2 O dissociation and the reduction kinetics of H + . Additionally, the nanowires provide pathways for electron transfer and the transmission of reactants. Consequently, the 1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C exhibits high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction ( &#951; 10 of 31 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction ( &#951; 10 of 210 mV) in 1 m KOH. The electrolytic cell based on 1D Co/Co 6 Mo 6 C requires a low voltage of 1.43 V to drive 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . The catalyst also exhibits good HER performance in 1 m phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution, exceeding Pt/C at a current density &gt;42 mA cm &#8722;2 .</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Screening of Atomically Precise Pure Metal Nanoclusters for Oxygen Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c01737</link>
      <description>Nishchal Bharadwaj, Diptendu Roy, A. Das, Biswarup Pathak, ACS Materials Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406116618

                Developing efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells is challenging due to high power density and durability requirements. Subnanometer clusters (SNCs) show promise, but their fluxional behavior and complex structure&#8211;activity relationships hinder catalyst design. We combine density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to study transition metal-based subnanometer nanoclusters (TMSNCs) ranging from 3 to 30 atoms, aiming to establish structure activity relationship (SAR) for ORR. Subdividing the data set based on size and periodic groups significantly improves the accuracy of our ML models. Importantly, the ML model predicting the ORR catalytic performance is validated through DFT calculations, identifying 12 promising catalysts. Late group TMSNCs exhibit enhanced ORR activity, reflected in a noticeable shift toward Au/Ag metals on the volcano plot. This underscores the importance of investigating late group TMSNCs alongside Pt for the ORR. ML accelerates TMSNC design, surpassing computational screening and advancing catalyst development.</description>

      <title>Precisely designing asymmetrical selenium-based dual-atom sites for efficient oxygen reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-55862-6</link>
      <description>Xiaochen Wang, Ning Zhang, Huishan Shang, Haojie Duan, Zhiyi Sun, Lili Zhang, Yuanting Lei, Xuan Luo, Liang Zhang, Bing Zhang, Wenxing Chen, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406120170

                Owing to their synergistic interactions, dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with well-defined active sites are attracting increasing attention. However, more experimental research and theoretical investigations are needed to further construct explicit dual-atom sites and understand the synergy that facilitates multistep catalytic reactions. Herein, we precisely design a series of asymmetric selenium-based dual-atom catalysts that comprise heteronuclear SeN2&#8211;MN2 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, etc.) active sites for the efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Spectroscopic characterisation and theoretical calculations revealed that heteronuclear selenium atoms can efficiently polarise the charge distribution of other metal atoms through short-range regulation. In addition, compared with the Se or Fe single-atom sites, the SeFe dual-atom sites facilitate a reduction in the conversion energy barrier from *O to *OH via the coadsorption of *O intermediates. Among these designed selenium-based dual-atom catalysts, selenium-iron dual-atom catalysts achieves superior alkaline ORR performance, with a half-wave potential of 0.926 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. In addition, the SeN2&#8211;FeN2-based Zn&#8211;air battery has a high specific capacity (764.8 mAh g&#8722;1) and a maximum power density (287.2 mW cm&#8722;2). This work may provide a good perspective for designing heteronuclear DACs to improve ORR efficiency. Dual-atom catalysts with precise active sites are gaining attention, but further studies are needed to optimise their construction and understand their catalytic synergy. Here the authors report a series of asymmetric selenium-based dual- atom catalysts that comprise heteronuclear SeN2&#8211;MN2 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, etc.) active sites for the efficient oxygen reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Computational Screening and Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Separation from Flue Gas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54254/2755-2721/2025.19579</link>
      <description>Xiuling Jiao, Aiping Chen, Applied and Computational Engineering. 123(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406126000

                Rising CO2 levels, largely from flue gas emissions, are a significant contributor to global climate change. Adsorption using Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) offers a promising solution for CO2 capture due to their high surface area, tunable porosity, and selectivity. To streamline the discovery of efficient MOFs, we developed a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) pipeline by integrating Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, molecular modeling and machine learning. We screened a filtered subset of the CoREMOF database and a user-defined hypothetical MOF bank to identify candidates with high CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity. This approach yielded several high-performing MOFs, including five from the CoREMOF dataset and a new structure from the hypothetical bank exceeding the performance of existing MOFs. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between MOF geometries and CO2 capture performance, emphasizing the importance of features like open metal sites and pore geometry. This computational framework accelerates MOF discovery and provides valuable insights for experimental synthesis. Future work will focus on expanding the hypothetical MOF dataset, improving simulation accuracy, and employing advanced optimization techniques to enhance the screening process.</description>

      <title>Rationally Designed Air Electrode Boosting Electrochemical Performance of Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202402654</link>

                Abstract Protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) have gained significant attention as a promising electrochemical device for hydrogen production and power generation at intermediate temperatures. However, the lack of high&#8208;performance air electrodes, specifically in terms of proton conduction ability, has severely hindered the improvement of electrochemical performances for PCCs. In this study, a high&#8208;efficiency air electrode La 0.8 Ba 0.2 CoO 3 (LBC) is rationally designed and researched by a machine&#8208;learning model and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which boosts the performances of PCCs. Specifically, an elements&#8208;property map for designing high&#8208;efficiency oxides is created by predicting and studying the proton uptake ability of La 1&#8211; x A&#8242; x BO 3 (A&#8242; = Na, K, Ca, Mg, Ba, Cu, etc.) by an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model. PCC with LBC air electrode yields high current destiny in electrolysis mode (1.72 A cm &#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C) and power density in fuel cell mode (1.00 W cm &#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C). In addition, an ultra&#8208;low air electrode reaction resistance (0.03 &#937; cm 2 at 600 &#176;C) is achieved, because LBC can significantly facilitate the formation of O 2 * . This work not only reports an effective air electrode but also presents a new avenue for the rational design of air electrodes for PCCs.</description>

      <title>Linkage Regulation of &#946;-Ketoamine Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Two dimensional &#946;-ketoamine covalent organic frameworks (2D TP-COFs) are one category of promising metal-free catalysts for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) because of their unusual stability and versatile electronic/optical properties. However, none of the currently reported TP-COFs can accomplish the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) simultaneously without adding any sacrificial agents and cocatalysts. To address this challenging issue, we rationally designed 23 2D TP-COFs by regulating the linkage groups and comprehensively evaluated their OWS activity by using the first-principles method. First, the electronic band structure calculations at the HSE06 level reveal that the band gap can be reasonably adjusted with values ranging from 1.67&#8211;3.16 eV. Among these 23 systems, 10 TP-COFs are realized to match well with both the chemical potentials of H2/H+ and O2/H2O, which are capable of visible-light-driven OWS from an electronic perspective. Further thermal activity results on OWS demonstrate that only Hep-BDA (heptazine-aniline) and Bpy-4 (bipyrimidinamine) based COFs can satisfy the completely spontaneous of HER and OER under light irradiation and neutral conditions. Importantly, the calculated small exciton binding energies and high carrier mobility for Hep-BDA and Bpy-4 TP-COFs propose they are potentially applied in photocatalytic OWS. We also achieved the theoretical energy conversion efficiency of Hep-BDA can reach as high as 13.01%. Because there are very few successful applications of TP-COFs on OWS, this theoretical work not only offers valuable insights and innovative ideas for the exploration of novel metal-free photocatalysts for OWS but also supplies a direction for the development of new TP-COF derivatives.</description>

                Direct carbonylation of CH4 to CH3COOH provides a promising pathway for upgrading of natural gas to transportable liquid chemicals, in which high-efficiency CH4 activation and controllable C&#8211;C coupling are both critical but challenging. Herein, we report that highly efficient photo-driven carbonylation of CH4 with CO and O2 to CH3COOH is achieved over MoS2-confined Rh-Zn atomic-pair in conjunction with TiO2. It delivers a high CH3COOH productivity of 152.0 &#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and turnover frequency of 62.0 h&#8722;1 with a superior selectivity of 96.5%, outperforming previous photocatalytic CH4 carbonylation processes. Mechanistic investigations disclose the key effect of Rh-Zn synergy in combination with photo-excited electrons from TiO2 for CH3COOH formation. The active OH species produced from O2 photoreduction on the Zn site through proton-coupled electron transfer promotes CH4 dissociation to CH3 species, which then facilely couples with adsorbed CO on the adjacent Rh site forming the key CH3CO intermediate for CH3COOH formation. The authors report a catalyst featuring Rh-Zn dual sites in a MoS2 lattice integrated with TiO2 for the photocatalytic carbonylation of CH4 with CO and O2 to CH3COOH with a high productivity of 152.0 &#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 96.5%.</description>

      <title>Self-Reduction of Nitric Oxide on Alumina-Supported Ultra-Small Nickel Particles</title>

Khekilaev, &#1058;. &#1058;. &#1052;&#1072;&#1075;&#1082;&#1086;&#1077;&#1074;, &#1054;. &#1043;. &#1040;&#1096;&#1093;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;, Surfaces. 8(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406169609

                The adsorption and reaction of nitric oxide (NO) molecules on the surface of the model-supported metal/oxide system, consisting of Ni nanoparticles deposited on &#945;-Al2O3 (0001) in ultra-high vacuum, have been studied using in situ surface-sensitive techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a combination of X-ray and Auger electron spectroscopy (XPS, AES), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) techniques reveals, there is a threshold of Ni particle mean size (&lt;d&gt;) of c.a. 2 nm, differentiating the electron state of adsorbed NO molecules and their reaction. The main feature of Ni particles normally not exceeding 2 nm is that the NO adsorbs in the form of (NO)2 dimers, whereas, for larger particles, the NO molecules adsorb in the form of monomers, usually characteristic for the bulk Ni substrate. This difference is demonstrated to be the main reason for the different reaction of NO molecules on the surface of Ni/alumina. The striking feature is that, in the case of ultra-small Ni particles (&lt;d&gt; &#8804; 2 nm), the nitrous oxide (N2O) molecules are formed upon heating as a result of the NO self-reduction mechanism, which are otherwise not formed in the case of larger Ni particles. According to DFT results, this is due to the significant synergistic impact of NO co-adsorption on the neighboring NO dissociation reaction over ultra-small Ni particles, mediated by the metal/oxide perimeter interface. The observed molecular conversion effects offer an opportunity to tune the catalytic selectivity of this and related metal/oxide systems via varying the supported metal particle size.</description>

      <title>Same FeN4 Active Site, Different Activity: How Redox Peaks Control Oxygen Reduction on Fe Macrocycles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acselectrochem.4c00146</link>

                Macrocycles show high activity for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen in alkaline media. However, even macrocycles with the same metal centers and MN4 active site can vary significantly in activity and selectivity, and to this date, a quantitative insight into the cause of these staggering differences has not been unambiguously reached. These macrocycles form a fundamental platform, similarly to platinum alloys for metal ORR catalyst, to unravel fundamental properties of FeNx catalysts. In this manuscript, we present a systematic study of several macrocycles, with varying active site motif and ligands, using electrochemical techniques, operando spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Our study demonstrates the existence of two families of Fe macrocycles for oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolytes: (i) weak *OH binding macrocycles with one peak in the voltammogram and high peroxide selectivity and (ii) macrocycles with close to optimal *OH binding, which exhibit two voltametric peaks and almost no peroxide production. Here, we also propose three mechanisms that would explain our experimental findings. Understanding what differentiates these two families could shed light on how to optimize the activity of pyrolyzed FeNx catalysts.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Multiple pH-Dependent Factors on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction at Au(111)</title>

                Understanding how the electrolyte pH affects electrocatalytic activity is a topic of crucial importance in a large variety of systems. However, unraveling the origin of the pH effects is complicated often by the fact that both the reaction driving forces and reactant concentrations in the electric double layer (EDL) change simultaneously with the pH value. Herein, we employ the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at Au(111)-aqueous solution interfaces as a model system to disentangle different pH-dependent factors. In 0.1 M NaOH, the HER current density at Au(111) in the potential range of &#8722;0.4 V &lt; ERHE &lt; 0 V is up to 60 times smaller than that in 0.1 M HClO4. A reaction model with proper consideration of the local reaction conditions within the EDL is developed. After correcting for the EDL effects, the rate constant for HER is only weakly pH-dependent. Our analysis unambiguously reveals that the observed pH effects are mainly due to the pH-dependent reorganization free energy, which depends on the electrostatic potential and the local reaction conditions within the EDL. Possible origins of the pH and temperature dependence of the activation energy and the electron transfer coefficients are discussed. This work suggests that factors influencing the intrinsic pH-dependent kinetics are easier to understand after proper corrections of EDL effects.</description>

      <title>Disclosure of the hydrogen evolution mechanism on [FeFe]-hydrogenases-inspired molecular catalysts &#8211; a DFT study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ch24137</link>

                The FeFe bio-inspired molecular catalysts that mimic the [FeFe] hydrogenases have been widely studied. However, the hydrogen evolution mechanism on the molecular catalysts is still not fully understood. In this work, the theoretical calculation was linked with experimental catalytic performance to reveal the possible reaction mechanism of FeFe molecular catalysts. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on the FeFe molecular catalysts exhibited a good match with the experimental overpotential data, with a R2 of 0.592. The detailed DFT study indicated that the first H+/e&#8722; injection was the largest thermodynamic impediment in the whole hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cycle which follows a proton transfer &#8211; electron transfer (PT-ET) mechanism. The injected hydrogen binds to the bridging position between FeFe centre (&#181;-H) and then transfers to a terminal hydrogen on Fe (t-H). Later, the t-H combines with the second injected hydrogen to form a H2 molecule which is then released from the catalyst. The effect of different ligands on HER was also studied. It was found that different ligands around the FeFe centre could significantly change the PT and ET energy, and some could provide additional binding sites for protons.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic asymmetric C-C coupling for CO2 reduction on dynamically reconstructed Ru&#948;+-O/Ru0-O sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-55885-z</link>

                Solar-driven CO2 reduction to value-added C2 chemicals is thermodynamically challenging due to multiple complicated steps. The design of active sites and structures for photocatalysts is necessary to improve solar energy efficiency. In this work, atomically dispersed Ru-O sites in RuxIn2-xO3 are constructed by interior lattice anchoring of Ru. This results in the dynamic reconstruction of Ru&#948;+-O/Ru0-O sites upon photoexcitation, which facilitates the CO2 activation, *CO intermediates adsorption, and C-C coupling as demonstrated by varied in situ techniques. A SiO2 core in RuxIn2-xO3/SiO2 construction further enhances the solar energy utilization and individual RuxIn2-xO3 nanocrystals dispersion for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. It results in the maximum ethanol production rate up to 31.6 &#956;mol/g/h with over 90% selectivity. DFT simulation reveals that the C2 dimer formation primarily underwent an asymmetric *CO-*CHO coupling route via a low-energy precedence ladder of *CHO. This work provides an insightful understanding of active sites with dynamic reconstruction towards asymmetric C-C coupling for CO2RR at the atomic scale.

      <title>Inverse catalysts: tuning the composition and structure of oxide clusters through the metal support</title>

                Computational modeling of metal&#8211;oxide interfaces is challenging due to the large search space of compositions and structures and the complexity of catalyst materials under operating conditions in general. In this work, we develop an efficient structure search workflow to discover chemically unique and relevant nanocluster geometries of inverse catalysts and apply it to ZnyOx and InyOx on Cu(111), Pd(111), and Au(111). We show that the workflow is successful in obtaining a large range of chemically distinct structures. Structural geometry trends are identified, including stable motifs such as tripod, rhombus, and pyramidal motifs. Using ab initio thermodynamics, we explore the in situ stability of the structures, including single-atom alloys, at a range of oxygen availabilities. This approach allows us to find trends such as the susceptibility to oxidation of the different systems and the range of stability of different cluster motifs. Our analysis highlights the importance of taking the diversity of sites exposed by metal&#8211;oxide interfaces into account in catalyst design studies.</description>

      <title>Engineering Metal Nanoclusters at the Atomic Level for Effective Electrocatalysis</title>

                ABSTRACT With the advances of nanochemistry in the past several decades, a diverse set of nanomaterials has been developed as electrocatalysts with enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability for electrocatalytic reactions. However, it has remained as a long challenge to systematically understand the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions, which involves multiple protons&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes and varied products at the atomic level, intrinsically because of the complexity and polydispersity of the traditional nanomaterials. By sharp contrast, ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) possess atomically precise structures and abundant active sites, facilitating their applications as effective model electrocatalysts for revealing the mechanism of electrocatalytic reactions. This review summarizes recent progress in atom&#8208;level engineering of metal NCs as model catalysts for electrocatalytic reactions. Specifically, we first discuss the effects of metal composition engineering, including doping and size effects, on the electrocatalytic performance of metal NCs. Then similar electrocatalytic discussion extends to ligand effects of metal NCs, where ligand type and coverage engineering are deciphered. Moreover, we discuss how the overall charge and morphology of NCs modify their electrocatalytic performance. The fundamental and methodological insights summarized in this review should serve as useful references guiding the future development of effective metal electrocatalysts in diverse sectors of industry.</description>

      <title>Nonprecious Triple-Atom Catalysts with Ultrahigh Activity for Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia: A DFT Screening</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c17726</link>
      <description>Xiangyi Zhou, Mohsen Tamtaji, Weijun Zhou, William A. Goddard, GuanHua Chen, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406242426

                Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is promising to not only tackle environmental issues caused by nitrate but also produce ammonia at room temperatures. However, two critical challenges are the lack of effective electrocatalysts and the understanding of related reaction mechanisms. To overcome these challenges, we employed first-principles calculations to thoroughly study the performance and mechanisms of triple-atom catalysts (TACs) composed of transition metals (including 27 homonuclear TACs and 4 non-noble bimetallic TACs) anchored on N-doped carbon (NC). We found five promising candidates possessing not only thermodynamic and electrochemical stability, but also high activity and selectivity for ammonia production. Among them, non-noble homonuclear Ni3@NC TAC show high activity with low theoretical limiting potential of &#8722;0.31 VRHE. Surprisingly, bimetallic Co2Ni@NC, Co2Cu@NC, and Fe2Ni@NC TACs show ultrahigh activity with theoretical limiting potentials of 0.00 VRHE, without a potential determining step in the whole reaction pathways, representing the best theoretical activity been reported up to date. These promising candidates are facilitated by circumventing the limit of scaling relationships, a well-known obstacle for single-atom catalysts. This study indicates that designing suitable TACs can be a promising strategy for efficiently electro-catalyzing NO3RR and breaking the limit of the scaling relationship.</description>

                Abstract The industrial application of green hydrogen production from water electrolysis strongly depends on the invention of low&#8208;cost, highly&#8208;active, and stable nonprecious electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a two&#8208;step process is developed to prepare a NiCo&#8208;Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst by a low&#8208;temperature selenization of NiCo&#8208;PBA precursors electro&#8208;deposited on carbon fibre paper. The NiCo&#8208;Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for the OER, with an overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and a Tafel slope of only 39.94 mV dec &#8722;1 in 1 M KOH. The steady current density and well&#8208;preserved microscopic morphology during the 20 h electrolysis proves its outstanding stability. The high inherent activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D porous structure, the synergistic effects of Ni, and Co active components doping, and low&#8208;temperature selenization. The results provide an insightful reference for further improving composition and structure design while investigating nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Catalysts are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The precise design and regulation of catalytic sites to strengthen their efficiency and robustness remains challenging. In this study, spinel sulfides and catalyst design principles through element doping are investigated. This research highlights the distinct role of lattice sulfur sites in lithium polysulfide conversion and emphasizes the differences in catalytic activity between metal and anion sites. The valence electron model as a descriptor can characterize catalytic performance, guiding the design of a (FeCo) 3 (PS) 4 catalyst co&#8208;doped with cation and anion. The (FeCo) 3 (PS) 4 exhibits the highest catalytic performance among spinel catalysts to data, particularly under high sulfur loading conditions. It achieves an initial specific capacity of 1205.9 mAh g &#8722;1 (6.1 mAh cm &#8722;2 ) at a sulfur loading of 5 mg cm &#8722;2 and 1192.7 mAh g &#8722;1 (11.9 mAh cm &#8722;2 ) at 10 mg cm &#8722;2 , demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance.</description>

                Developing clean and renewable energy technologies requires the design of efficient bifunctional catalysts that do not rely on inert metals for electrochemical water splitting. This study introduced a novel three-step strategy to fabricate NiCoFe-modified MoNi4/MoO2 nanowires supported on nickel foam substrates (denoted as NiCoFe-MoNi4/MoO2/NF), which demonstrate excellent catalytic performance with an impressively low overpotential of just 13 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 230 mV at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, its performance greatly exceeded that of many noble-metal catalysts, requiring only 1.51 V for overall water splitting at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 current density. The exceptional catalytic efficiency is ascribed to the unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and the synergistic interactions between the NiCoFe complex and the MoNi4/MoO2 framework, which improve mass transfer, increase active site exposure, and enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. The incorporation of cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) into the ternary complex significantly enhanced the efficiencies of both HER and OER, offering a promising route for developing high-performance, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts and advancing sustainable energy conversion technologies.</description>

                Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for predicting material properties, yet they often struggle to capture many-body interactions and require extensive manual feature engineering. Here, we present EOSnet (Embedded Overlap Structures for Graph Neural Networks), a novel approach that addresses these limitations by incorporating Gaussian Overlap Matrix (GOM) fingerprints as node features within the GNN architecture. Unlike models that rely on explicit angular terms or human-engineered features, EOSnet efficiently encodes many-body interactions through orbital overlap matrices, providing a rotationally invariant and transferable representation of atomic environments. The model demonstrates superior performance across various prediction tasks of materials' properties, achieving particularly notable results in properties sensitive to many-body interactions. For band gap prediction, EOSnet achieves a mean absolute error of 0.163 eV, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models. The model also excels in predicting mechanical properties and classifying materials, with 97.7% accuracy in metal/nonmetal classification. These results demonstrate that embedding GOM fingerprints into node features enhances the ability of GNNs to capture complex atomic interactions, making EOSnet a powerful tool for materials' discovery and property prediction.</description>

                Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have emerged as a generation of nonprecious catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), largely due to their theoretical hydrogen adsorption energy close to that of platinum. However, efforts to activate the basal planes of TMDs have primarily centered around strategies such as introducing numerous atomic vacancies, creating vacancy&#8211;heteroatom complexes, or applying significant strain, especially for acidic media. These approaches, while potentially effective, present substantial challenges in practical large-scale deployment. Here, we report a gap-state engineering strategy for the controlled activation of S atom in MoS2 basal planes through metal single-atom doping, effectively tackling both efficiency and stability challenges in alkaline water and seawater splitting. A versatile synthetic methodology allows for the fabrication of a series of single-metal atom-doped MoS2 materials (M1/MoS2), featuring widely tunable densities with each dopant replacing a Mo site. Among these (Mn1, Fe1, Co1, and Ni1), Co1/MoS2 demonstrates outstanding HER performance in both alkaline and seawater alkaline media, with overpotentials at a mere 159 and 164 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2, and Tafel slopes at 41 and 45 mV dec&#8211;1, respectively, which surpasses all reported TMD-based nonprecious materials and benchmark Pt/C catalysts in HER efficiency and stability during seawater splitting, which can be attributed to an optimal gap-state modulation associated with sulfur atoms. Experimental data correlating doping density and dopant identity with HER performance, in conjunction with theoretical calculations, also reveal a descriptor linked to near-Fermi gap state modulation, corroborated by the observed increase in unoccupied S 3p states.</description>

                Abstract Construction of core&#8211;shell structured electrocatalysts with a thin noble metal shell is an effective strategy for lowering the usage of the noble metal and improving electrocatalytic properties because of the structure&#8208;induced geometric and electronic effects. Here, the synthesis of a novel core&#8211;shell structured nanocatalyst consisting of a thin amorphous Pd shell and a crystalline PdCu core and its significantly improved electrocatalytic properties for both formic acid oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions are shown. The electrocatalyst exhibits 4.1 times higher catalytic peak current density and better stability in the formic acid oxidation compared to both a PdCu nanoalloy catalyst and a Commercial Pd&#8211;C catalyst. An excellent electrocatalytic performance of the core&#8211;shell nanocatalyst is also observed in the oxygen reduction reaction. Computational calculation results reveal that tuning of the electronic state of Pd by the amorphous shell and the Cu in the PdCu core weaken the binding strength of surface Pd&#9472;O bonds, leading to a bond elongation to facilitate bond breaking. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity in both formic acid oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions is enhanced.</description>

      <title>SurFF: Universal Model for Surface Exposure and Synthesizability Across Intermetallic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4863775/v1</link>

                Abstract Catalysts are crucial in industrial processes, significantly enhancing reaction efficiency. With approximately 90% of industrial reactions occurring on surfaces, the role of heterogeneous catalysts is paramount. Accurate surface exposure prediction is vital for heterogeneous catalyst design but is hindered by the high costs of experimental and computational methods. Here, we introduce a universal force field-based model for predicting surface exposure and synthesizability (SurFF) across intermetallic crystals, essential materials for heterogeneous catalysts. We created a comprehensive intermetallic surface database using a data-efficient active learning method and high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, encompassing 12,553 unique surfaces and 344,200 single points. SurFF achieves DFT-level precision with a prediction error of 3.0 meV/&#197;&#178; and enables large-scale surface exposure prediction, an impractical task for DFT methods, through a 105-fold acceleration. Validation against computational and experimental data both shows strong alignment. We applied SurFF for large-scale predictions on over 6,000 intermetallic crystals, providing valuable data for the community. Demonstrating transferability to diverse crystal properties, SurFF is a robust tool for advancing catalyst design, representing a significant step toward large-scale catalyst discovery models.</description>
