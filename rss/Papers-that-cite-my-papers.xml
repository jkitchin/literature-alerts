                Abstract Alternative strategies to design sustainable&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalysts enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are demanded to develop affordable yet high&#8208;performance water&#8208;electrolyzers for green hydrogen production. Here, it is demonstrated that the spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated framework comprising abundant elements of nickel and iron with a ratio of Ni:Fe = 1:4 with benzenehexathiol linker (BHT) can improve OER kinetics by its unique electronic property. Among the bimetallic NiFe x:y &#8208;BHTs with various ratios with Ni:Fe = x:y, the NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT exhibits the highest OER activity. The NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT shows a specific current density of 140 A g &#8722;1 at the overpotential of 350 mV. This performance is one of the best activities among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;precious OER electrocatalysts and even comparable to that of the platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals of RuO 2 and IrO 2 . The density functional theory calculations uncover that introducing Ni into the homometallic Fe&#8208;BHT (e.g., Ni:Fe = 0:1) can emerge a spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized state. Thus, this material can achieve improved OER kinetics with spin&#8208;polarization which previously required external magnetic fields. This work shows that a rational design of 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated frameworks can be a powerful strategy to synthesize promising electrocatalysts with abundant elements for a wide spectrum of next&#8208;generation energy devices.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;emle-engine&lt;/i&gt;: A Flexible Electrostatic Machine Learning Embedding Package for Multiscale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00248</link>
      <description>Kirill Zinovjev, Lester O. Hedges, Rub&#233;n Montagud Andreu, Christopher Woods, I&#241;aki Tu&#241;&#243;n, Marc W. van der Kamp, Journal of chemical theory and computation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399091017

                We present in this work the emle-engine package (https://github.com/chemle/emle-engine)&#9472;the implementation of a new machine learning embedding scheme for hybrid machine learning potential/molecular-mechanics (ML/MM) dynamics simulations. The package is based on an embedding scheme that uses a physics-based model of the electronic density and induction with a handful of tunable parameters derived from in vacuo properties of the subsystem to be embedded. This scheme is completely independent of the in vacuo potential and requires only the positions of the atoms of the machine learning subsystem and the positions and partial charges of the molecular mechanics environment. These characteristics allow emle-engine to be employed in existing QM/MM software. We demonstrate that the implemented electrostatic machine learning embedding scheme (named EMLE) is stable in enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Through the calculation of free energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide in water with two different ML options for the in vacuo potential and three embedding models, we test the performance of EMLE. When compared to the reference DFT/MM surface, the EMLE embedding is clearly superior to the MM one based on fixed partial charges. The configurational dependence of the electronic density and the inclusion of the induction energy introduced by the EMLE model leads to a systematic reduction in the average error of the free energy surface when compared to MM embedding. By enabling the usage of EMLE embedding in practical ML/MM simulations, emle-engine will make it possible to accurately model systems and processes that feature significant variations in the charge distribution of the ML subsystem and/or the interacting environment.</description>

      <title>Predictive Synthesis of Transition Metal Carbide via Thermochemical Oxocarbon Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c03820</link>
      <description>Seo Jin Oh, Dohun Kim, Ji-Yong Kim, Geosan Kang, Junho Jeon, Miyoung Kim, Young&#8208;Chang Joo, Dae&#8208;Hyun Nam, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399123083

                Fabricating nanoscale metal carbides is a great challenge due to them having higher Gibbs free energy of formation (&#916;G&#176;) values than other metal compounds; additionally, these carbides have harsh calcination conditions, in which metal oxidation is preferred in the atmosphere. Herein, we report oxocarbon-mediated calcination for the predictive synthesis of nanoscale metal carbides. The thermochemical oxocarbon equilibrium of CO&#8211;CO2 reactions was utilized to control the selective redox reactions in multiatomic systems of Mo&#8211;C&#8211;O, contributing to the phase-forming and structuring of Mo compounds. By harnessing the thermodynamically predicted processing window, we controlled a wide range of Mo phases (MoO2, &#945;-MoC1&#8211;x, and &#946;-Mo2C) and nanostructures (nanoparticle, spike, stain, and core/shell) in the Mo compounds/C nanofibers. By inducing simultaneous reactions of C&#8211;O (selective C combustion) and Mo&#8211;C (Mo carbide formation) in the nanofibers, Mo diffusion was controlled in C nanofibers, acting as a template for the nucleation and growth of Mo carbides and resulting in precise control of the phases and structures of Mo compounds. The formation mechanism of nanostructured Mo carbides was elucidated according to the CO fractions of CO&#8211;CO2 calcination. Moreover, tungsten (W) and niobium (Nb) carbides/C nanofibers have been successfully synthesized by CO&#8211;CO2 calcination. We constructed the thermodynamic map for the predictive synthesis of transition metal carbides to provide universal guideline via thermochemical oxocarbon equilibrium. We revealed that our thermochemical oxocarbon-mediated gas&#8211;solid reaction enabled the structure and phase control of nanoscale transition metal compounds to optimize the material&#8211;property relationship accordingly.</description>

      <title>The NOMAD mini-apps: A suite of kernels from ab initio electronic structure codes enabling co-design in high-performance computing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/openreseurope.16920.2</link>
      <description>Isidre Mas Magre, Rogeli Grima Torres, Jos&#233; Mar&#237;a, Jos&#233; Julio Guti&#233;rrez Moreno, Open research Europe. 4(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399124316

                This article introduces a suite of mini-applications (mini-apps) designed to optimise computational kernels in ab initio electronic structure codes. The suite is developed from flagship applications participating in the NOMAD Center of Excellence, such as the ELPA eigensolver library and the GW implementations of the exciting, Abinit, and FHI-aims codes. The mini-apps were identified by targeting functions that significantly contribute to the total execution time in the parent applications. This strategic selection allows for concentrated optimisation efforts. The suite is designed for easy deployment on various High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems, supported by an integrated CMake build system for straightforward compilation and execution. The aim is to harness the capabilities of emerging (post)exascale systems, which necessitate concurrent hardware and software development &#8212; a concept known as co-design. The mini-app suite serves as a tool for profiling and benchmarking, providing insights that can guide both software optimisation and hardware design. Ultimately, these developments will enable more accurate and efficient simulations of novel materials, leveraging the full potential of exascale computing in material science research.</description>

      <title>Design of Multifunctional Electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER/HOR: Janus Makes Difference</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404000</link>
      <description>Xinyu Yang, Long Lin, Xiangyu Guo, Shengli Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399140360

                Abstract Multifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have broad application prospects; However, realization of such kinds of materials remain difficulties because it requires the materials to have not only unique electronic properties, but multiple active centers to deal with different reactions. Here, employing density functional theory (DFT) computations, it is demonstrated that by decorating the Janus&#8208;type 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) of TaSSe with the single atoms, the materials can achieve multifunctionality to catalyze the ORR/OER/HER/HOR. Out of sixteen catalytic systems, Pt&#8208;V S (i.e., Pt atom embedded in the sulfur vacancy), Pd&#8208;V Se , and Pt&#8208;V Se @TaSSe are promising multifunctional catalysts with superior stability. Among them, the Pt&#8208;V S @TaSSe catalyst exhibits the highest activity with theoretical overpotentials &#951; ORR = 0.40 V, &#951; OER = 0.39 V, and &#951; HER/HOR = 0.07 V, respectively, better than the traditional Pt (111), IrO 2 (110). The interplays between the catalyst and the reaction intermediate over the course of the reaction are then systematically investigated. Generally, this study presents a viable approach for the design and development of advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts. It enriches the application of Janus, a new 2D material, in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technology.</description>

      <title>There is no escape: How insertion of a single Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom into lattice of &#946;-molybdenum carbide affects its fundamental properties and catalytic activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfin.2024.104533</link>
      <description>Andrey A. Koverga, Elizabeth Fl&#243;rez, Edson A. Ticianelli, Surfaces and interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399142810

                Impact of insertion of a single Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom into crystalline lattice of orthorhombic Mo2C(001) surface on fundamental properties of the surface atoms has been investigated by means of density functional theory. Polar C- and Mo-terminated surfaces were used as model systems and two modes of the foreign atom insertion were considered: into the topmost Mo layer of the surface and into metal layer deeper in the structure of the host system. Calculations revealed that TM-modified Mo2C compounds were less stable than the pristine carbide with no significant changes in work function of the carbide surface, regardless of its termination, foreign atom nature, and its position in the host system. Furthermore, presence of either Fe, Co, Ni or Cu atom in subsurface or in the topmost metal layer of the terminations did not impact noticeably electronic structure of either C or Mo atoms closest to the modification site as evidenced from analysis of their density of states. Consequentially, insertion of foreign atoms into the lattice of molybdenum carbide results in atomic hydrogen stability close to that on the corresponding unmodified polar termination of the Mo2C(001) surface. In the context of experimentally observed changes in catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide toward hydrogen evolution reaction upon doping it with transition metals, the obtained data evidence that the major effect comes from the foreign atoms being adsorbed on molybdenum carbide surface, while insertion into the lattice bears no significant impact. This suggests that coating Mo2C surface with transition metals can be promising strategy to modify and tailor its catalytic properties for hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical studies of WO3/Vulcan XC-72 electrocatalyst enhanced H2O2 yield ORR performed in acid and alkaline medium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2024.113182</link>
      <description>Jo&#227;o Paulo Moura, Lanna E.B. Luchetti, Caio Machado Fernandes, Aline B. Trench, Camila Neves Lange, Bruno Lemos Batista, J. Almeida, Mauro C. Santos, Journal of environmental chemical engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399142859

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a pivotal role in clean energy generation and sustainable chemical production, particularly in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this study, WO3/Vulcan-XC72 electrocatalysts have been synthesized and characterized for ORR applications. We assessed the ratio of WO3 to Vulcan-XC72 and investigated the impact of electrolytes pH (covering acidic and alkaline media) on the ORR process. The results revealed that WO3 with a monoclinic crystalline phase and nanoflower-like morphology was successfully synthesized, and confirmed an improvement in surface properties, with an increase in hydrophilicity and superficial oxygenated species. Electrochemical studies showed that WO3/C was the most selective for H2O2 electrogeneration, compared to pure Vulcan-XC72, in both acidic and alkaline media. These results indicate that the ORR on the WO3/C electrocatalyst surface has a pH-dependent mechanism. Using WO3/C GDEs, an accumulation of 862 mg L-1 of H2O2 was achieved after 120 min of electrolysis at 100 mA cm-2. The higher selectivity of WO3/C could be related to the presence of more oxygen functional acid species on the catalyst surface and increased hydrophilicity compared to pure Vulcan, as well as a synergistic effect of the WO3 nanoflowers in ORR, confirmed by theoretical calculations. The results reveal that WO3/Vulcan is a promising catalyst for H2O2 electrogeneration via the ORR.</description>

      <title>Computational Exploration of Subnano Zn and Cu Species on Cu/ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Implications for Methanol Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c01300</link>

                Ternary Cu/Zn/ZrO2 catalysts prepared recently using atomic layer deposition (ALD) have shown increased performance toward methanol synthesis. In the present computational study, we have investigated the structure, composition, and stability of various zinc- and copper-containing subnano size species on a zirconia support. Density functional theory calculations with minima hopping were used to sample the positioning and geometry of supported ZnxCuyOz structures up to 8 metal atoms in total. ZnO monomeric species were found to be energetically more favorable than small clusters, which could suggest a resistance to initial stage agglomeration. Ab-initio thermodynamics revealed that under typical methanol synthesis conditions, the complete reduction of ZnO and mixed ZnO/Cu clusters is unfavorable. The investigated ZnO monomers and clusters are able to provide CO2 activation sites, with the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 triple interface offering the best stabilization for the adsorbed CO2. All in all, the findings suggest that small ZnO species generated by ALD could be stabilized by the zirconia component, while contact with copper species at the interface benefits CO2 activation.</description>

                Sluggish water oxidation reactions limit water electrolysis for H2 production, which can be alleviated by the use of carbon-based materials like agricultural wastes as reducing agents. Biochar from such biomass can reduce equilibrium cell potentials at standard conditions from 1.23 V to 0.21 V by avoiding direct water splitting at the anode. However, some challenges hinder biochar oxidation, including poor biochar binding, electrode caking, and surface passivation. We find that enhanced C/O ratio, crystallinity, and negative zeta potential improve biochar oxidation kinetics at moderate temperatures. Smaller particle sizes and better mixing prevent electrode caking, enhancing biochar stability. Here, we report sub-volt biochar-coupled H2 production, often referred to as a biochar-assisted water electrolysis (BAWE), yielding &#8764;250 mA/gcat H2 current at 100% Faradaic efficiency. Over 1 mA current was observed at a near-equilibrium cell potential of 0.2 V cell potential. Using a single-junction solar cell-powered BAWE, &#8764;15 mA H2 is generated at 1 Sun, resulting in &#8764;4.8% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, equivalent to &#8764;35% when the energy of H2 relative to H2O (without biochar) is assumed.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin Porous Pd Metallene with Amorphous/Crystalline Phase Coexitence as Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c01808</link>

                The development of efficient nonplatinum electrocatalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability is of crucial importance for the commercial application of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Metallenes exhibit excellent performance in energy and catalysis due to their unique physicochemical and electronic properties. In particular, the ultrahigh proportion of under-coordinated metal atomic sites in metallenes enhances the atom utilization and intrinsic activity, which endows them with considerable potential for catalytic applications. Herein, the synthesized two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin porous Pd metallene with amorphous/crystalline phase coexistence exhibits enhanced alkaline oxygen reduction properties, as evidenced by four-electron selectivity, lower overpotential (E1/2 = 0.944 V), high mass activity (MA = 1.44 mA/&#956;gPd), and solid stability (only loss of 7 mV in half-wave potential after 10,000 potential cycles). Such high performance of Pd metallene is attributed to amorphous/crystalline heterophases, 2D morphology, and porous structure. DFT calculations demonstrate that the ORR catalytic performance can be effectively promoted by the amorphous structure with a modulated electronic structure. The amorphous/crystalline coexisting porous Pd metallene with excellent catalytic performance can provide the reference for metallene materials design in various fields. This study presents a scientific basis to understand the mechanism of 2D amorphous phase nanostructures for boosting the electrocatalytic performance.</description>

                Abstract Symbolic regression (SR), exploring mathematical expressions from a given data set to construct an interpretable model, emerges as a powerful computational technique with the potential to transform the &#8220;black box&#8221; machining learning methods into physical and chemistry interpretable expressions in material science research. In this review, the current advancements in SR are investigated, focusing on the underlying theories, fundamental flowcharts, various techniques, implemented codes, and application fields. More predominantly, the challenging issues and future opportunities in SR that should be overcome to unlock the full potential of SR in material design and research, including graphics processing unit acceleration and transfer learning algorithms, the trade&#8208;off between expression accuracy and complexity, physical or chemistry interpretable SR with generative large language models, and multimodal SR methods, are discussed.</description>

                Copper and palladium exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Here, a PdxCu4&#8211;x (x = 2, 3) cluster was supported on CeO2 with different sites to form three kinds of novel nanocatalysts, namely, Pd2Cu2/CeO2, Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Pd), and Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Cu). Based on density functional theory, the catalytic performance and selective mechanisms were studied systematically. During the process of CO2RR, *CO was hydrogenated to produce deeply reduced products such as CH4 or CH3OH due to its strong adsorption energies on all three catalysts (Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Pd) for 0.95 eV, Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Cu) for 0.89 eV, and Pd2Cu2/CeO2 for 1.22 eV). The overpotential to form the CH4 or CH3OH product can be changed by varying the atomic ratio or anchoring sites of PdxCu4&#8211;x clusters on CeO2. In particular, the CO2RR on Pd2Cu2/CeO2 showed the lowest overpotentiontial (&#8722;0.60 eV) compared to the other two Pd3Cu/CeO2 catalysts. This study extends the family of CO2RR catalysts and the application scenarios of bimetallic catalysts, which provides new insights into the design and preparation of composite nanocatalysts.</description>

                Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, &gt;1 million studies have been collected within the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, a corpus of manuscripts created to accelerate research against the disease. Their related abstracts hold a wealth of information that remains largely unexplored and difficult to search due to its unstructured nature. Keyword-based search is the standard approach, which allows users to retrieve the documents of a corpus that contain (all or some of) the words in a target list. This type of search, however, does not provide visual support to the task and is not suited to expressing complex queries or compensating for missing specifications.</description>

                Swapping the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the thermodynamically advantageous sulfur ion oxidation reaction (SOR) makes it possible to produce low-energy hydrogen. We report here on an electrocatalytic SOR-coupled HER system that allows for the joint production of sulfur and hydrogen. We prepare a CoMoO4 nanoarray on nickel foam (NF) for anodic SOR and N-doped CoMoO4/NF, CoMoN/NF, for cathodic HER. The current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2 was obtained at 0.29 V (vs RHE) in the SOR process. After nitridation, the electrode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in HER at a voltage of only 32 mV (vs RHE). The coupling system (SOR//HER) can run steadily for 150 h. Detailed exploration and discussion were conducted on the pathways of SOR. This work develops an energy-efficient mixed water electrolysis system for H2, providing a viable option for toxic waste treatment.</description>

      <title>Distribution Tendencies of Noble Metals on Fe(100) Using Lattice Gas Cluster Expansions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c01402</link>
      <description>Isaac G. Onyango, Greg Collinge, Yong Wang, Jean&#8208;Sabin McEwen, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399176575

                Fe-based catalysts are highly selective for the hydrodeoxygenation of biomass-derived oxygenates but are prone to oxidative deactivation. Promotion with a noble metal has been shown to improve oxidative resistance. The chemical properties of such bimetallic systems depend critically on the surface geometry and spatial configuration of surface atoms in addition to their coverage (i.e., noble metal loading), so these aspects must be taken into account in order to develop reliable models for such complex systems. This requires sampling a vast configurational space, which is rather impractical using density functional theory (DFT) calculations alone. Moreover, "DFT-based" models are limited to length scales that are often too small for experimental relevance. Here, we circumvent this challenge by constructing DFT-parametrized lattice gas cluster expansions (LG CEs), which can describe these types of systems at significantly larger length scales. Here, we apply this strategy to Fe(100) promoted with four technologically relevant precious metals: Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru. The resultant LG CEs have remarkable predictive accuracy, with predictive errors below 10 meV/site over a coverage range of 0 to 2 monolayers. The ground state configurations for each noble metal were identified, and the analysis of the cluster energies reveals a significant disparity in their dispersion tendency.</description>

                This review provides a comprehensive overview of the production and modification of CZTS nanoparticles (NPs) and their application in electrocatalysis for water splitting. Various aspects, including surface modification, heterostructure design with carbon nanostructured materials, and tunable electrocatalytic studies, are discussed. A key focus is the synthesis of small CZTS nanoparticles with tunable reactivity, emphasizing the sonochemical method&#8217;s role in their formation. Despite CZTS&#8217;s affordability, it often exhibits poor hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) behavior. Carbon materials like graphene, carbon nanotubes, and C 60 are highlighted for their ability to enhance electrocatalytic activity due to their unique properties. The review also discusses the amine functionalization of graphene oxide/CZTS composites, which enhances overall water splitting performance. Doping with non-noble metals such as Fe, Co., and Ni is presented as an effective strategy to improve catalytic activity. Additionally, the synthesis of heterostructures consisting of CZTS nanoparticles attached to MoS 2 -reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids is explored, showing enhanced HER activity compared to pure CZTS and MoS 2 . The growing demand for energy and the need for efficient renewable energy sources, particularly hydrogen generation, are driving research in this field. The review aims to demonstrate the potential of CZTS-based electrocatalysts for high-performance and cost-effective hydrogen generation with low environmental impact. Vacuum-based and non-vacuum-based methods for fabricating CZTS are discussed, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Future developments in CZTS-based electrocatalysts include enhancing activity and stability, improving charge transfer mechanisms, ensuring cost-effectiveness and scalability, increasing durability, integrating with renewable energy sources, and gaining deeper insight into reaction processes. Overall, CZTS-based electrocatalysts show great promise for sustainable hydrogen generation, with ongoing research focused on improving performance and advancing their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Parallel Algorithm for Graph Neural Network Interatomic Potentials in Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

                Message-passing graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs), particularly those with equivariant representations such as NequIP, are attracting significant attention due to their data efficiency and high accuracy. However, parallelizing GNN-IPs poses challenges because multiple message-passing layers complicate data communication within the spatial decomposition method, which is preferred by many molecular dynamics (MD) packages. In this article, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme compatible with GNN-IPs and develop a package, SevenNet (Scalable EquiVariance-Enabled Neural NETwork), based on the NequIP architecture. For MD simulations, SevenNet interfaces with the LAMMPS package. Through benchmark tests on a 32-GPU cluster with examples of SiO2, SevenNet achieves over 80% parallel efficiency in weak-scaling scenarios and exhibits nearly ideal strong-scaling performance as long as GPUs are fully utilized. However, the strong-scaling performance significantly declines with suboptimal GPU utilization, particularly affecting parallel efficiency in cases involving lightweight models or simulations with small numbers of atoms. We also pretrain SevenNet with a vast data set from the Materials Project (dubbed "SevenNet-0") and assess its performance on generating amorphous Si3N4 containing more than 100,000 atoms. By developing scalable GNN-IPs, this work aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine-learning models and large-scale MD simulations, offering researchers a powerful tool to explore complex material systems with high accuracy and efficiency.</description>

                Abstract Electron transfer is a fundamental energy conversion process widely present in synthetic, industrial, and natural systems. Understanding the electron transfer process is important to exploit the uniqueness of the low-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures because interlayer electron transfer produces the function of this class of material. Here, we show the occurrence of an electron transfer process in one-dimensional layer-stacking of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). This observation makes use of femtosecond broadband optical spectroscopy, ultrafast time-resolved electron diffraction, and first-principles theoretical calculations. These results reveal that near-ultraviolet photoexcitation induces an electron transfer from the conduction bands of CNT to BNNT layers via electronic decay channels. This physical process subsequently generates radial phonons in the one-dimensional vdW heterostructure material. The gathered insights unveil the fundamentals physics of interfacial interactions in low dimensional vdW heterostructures and their photoinduced dynamics, pushing their limits for photoactive multifunctional applications.</description>

      <title>S-Scheme Boron Phosphide/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Heterostructure with Excellent Light Conversion Ability for Solar Cells and Water Splitting Photocatalysts</title>

                Monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with a suitable direct band gap and strong optical absorption is very attractive for utilization in solar cells and photocatalytic water splitting. Nevertheless, the broader utilization of MoS2 is impeded by its low carrier mobility and limited responsiveness to infrared light. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a variety of stackings for the boron phosphide (BP)/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH), all of which display S-scheme band alignments except for the AC&#8242; stacking. The constituent BP monolayer has superior carrier mobility and strong infrared and visible light response, which makes up for the shortcomings of MoS2. The study revealed that the AB stacking exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 22.27%, indicating its significant application prospect in solar cells. Additionally, the AB stacking also exhibits a promising application prospect in photocatalytic water splitting due to its suitable band structure, S-scheme band alignment, strong optical adsorption characteristic, high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, and robust built-in electric field. Meanwhile, applying uniaxial tensile strains along the x-axis direction is more beneficial for photocatalytic water splitting. Hence, the AB-stacked BP/MoS2 vdWH shows significant potential for use in both solar cells and photocatalytic water splitting. This work paves the way for exploring the application of S-scheme heterostructures in solar energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>Electric Double Layer Effect on the Outer-Sphere Benzyl Halides Electro-Reduction Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c08224</link>

                Electrocatalytic reduction of organic halides and subsequent carboxylation are promising methods for the valorization of CO2 as a C1 source in synthetic organic chemistry. The reaction mechanism underlying the selectivity and reduction mechanism of benzyl halides is highly dependent on the nature of the electrode material as well as the processes, composition, and structure of the liquid phase at the electrode&#8211;solution interface. Herein, we present a computational study on the influence of the electric double layer (EDL) on the activation of benzyl halides at different applied potentials over the Au (111) cathode. Using a multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate that, under realistic electrocatalytic conditions, the formation of a dense EDL over the cathode hampers the diffusion of benzyl halides toward the electrode surface. A combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations reveals the most favorable benzyl halide electro-carboxylation pathway over the EDL that does not require direct substrate adsorption to the cathode surface. The dense EDL promotes the dissociative reduction of the benzyl halides via the outer-sphere electron transfer from the cathode surface to the electrolyte. Such a reduction mechanism results in a benzyl radical intermediate, which is then converted to benzyl anions in the EDL via an additional electron transfer step.</description>

                The photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is a very promising approach for harvesting solar energy and recycling carbon resources. However, the native defects induced competition among different pathways for photocarriers is inevitable and negatively affects the selectivity. This work studies the competition between the vacancy induced pathway and the normal in a molybdenum sulfide selenide during photocatalytic CO2 reduction. It has been revealed that the high concentration of chalcogen vacancies can open up the carbene pathway by lowering the free energy and adjusting the adsorptions for the critical intermediates of *CH2 to attract the neighboring *CO for the C-C coupling in the ethanol production, and therefore improve the ethanol production obviously. We propose that in the design of photocatalysts for C2+ production, construction of variant active sites for the coupling of matching intermediates should be fully considered when choosing the basic materials, dopants and native defects.</description>

                Ultrafast heating of solids with modern x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) leads to a unique set of conditions characterized by the simultaneous presence of heated electrons in a cold ionic lattice. In this work, we analyze the effect of electronic heating on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) in bulk aluminum (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in silicon (Si) with a crystal diamond structure using first-principles linear-response time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We find a thermally induced red shift of the collective plasmon excitation in both materials. In addition, we show that the heating of the electrons in Al can lead to the formation of a double-plasmon peak due to the extension of the Landau damping region to smaller wave numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that thermal effects generate a measurable and distinct signature (peak-valley structure) in the DSF of Si at small frequencies. Our simulations indicate a variety of new features in the spectrum of x-ray-driven solids, specifically at finite momentum transfer, which can be probed in upcoming x-ray Thomson scattering experiments at various XFEL facilities.

                This review explores the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to drive sustainable clean energy solutions and their crucial role in transitioning towards a decarbonized global economy. The paper underscores the remarkable versatility and modifiability of MOFs. Central to this discourse is the conversion of MOFs into layered double hydroxides (LDHs), with a detailed exposition of the synthesis methodologies and their consequential effects on catalytic efficacy. A meticulous evaluation of MOF-derived LDHs is presented, particularly in the context of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), encapsulating cutting-edge progress and probing the feasibility of integrating these materials into next-generation energy technologies. Diverging from existing literature, this research provides an in-depth exploration of MOF-to-LDH conversion, a promising area in OER catalysis. In addition, structural engineering techniques to optimize the performance of MOF-derived LDHs in electrochemical devices are explored, highlighting the potential of MOFs as future electrocatalysts and guiding future research directions.</description>

                The Rh(111) electrode shows superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to Ir(111), contradicting the predicted trend based on the Volcano plot. To unveil the origin for this, we investigate the interfacial structures of Rh(111) single crystalline electrode in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions using cyclic voltammetry and potential step chronoamperometry under a hanging meniscus rotating disk electrode configuration. Our results reveal that i) in N2 saturated solution even at a potential below 0.20 V, oxygen-containing species adsorbates can be formed on the Rh(111) surface probably generated by oxidation of water; ii) Even under mild conditions, multiple cycles and current transients in O2 saturated solution at potentials where ORR taking place can cause significant surface disordering; iii) The disordering of the Rh(111) electrode induced by ORR exhibits similar base cyclic voltammograms to those of vicinal Rh(hkl) such as Rh(553) and Rh(332) etc., depending on the potentials applied during ORR, which, in turn, enhances the ORR activity in both 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4. These new findings provide valuable insights into the structure-performance relationship of ORR.</description>

                The urgency of tackling climate change is driving a global shift towards renewable sources of energy, with a growing contribution from alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. With the global push for the sustainable energy, the demand for effective catalysts for sustainable chemical production and energy storage has been rapidly increasing. Computational simulations have contributed to the rational design of catalysts by allowing profound analysis of catalyst properties. Machine learning potential (MLP) has emerged as a potential tool to bridge the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and computational efficiency, overcoming the computational cost limitations of quantum chemistry-based simulations. This review discusses the development and application of MLP in multiscale simulations of heterogeneous catalysis. It covers the basic concepts of computational catalysis, the construction of MLP focusing on efficient datasets, atomic structure representations, and the process of training and evaluating of ML models. Furthermore, the potential applications of MLP are discussed in addressing computational challenges within the field, as MLP has potential to overcome limitations in simulation time and length scale. Lastly, the prospects for MLP are presented, taking advantage of the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence architectures. It is expected that the integration of MLP will accelerate progress within the catalyst research community and will bridge the gap between theoretical and experimental approaches in catalytic research.</description>

      <title>Do we achieve &#8220;1 + 1 &amp;gt; 2&#8221; in dual-atom or dual-single-atom catalysts?</title>

                In recent years, the study of high utilization rates of metals in multiphase catalysis has sparked interest in various atomically dispersed catalysts. Compared to single-atom catalysts, diatomic catalysts not only retain advantages such as high active sites, unsaturated coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, but also incorporate multiple interactive mechanisms. This integration enables them to surpass the limits of single-atom catalysts in catalytic performance, demonstrating a unique ability of "1 + 1 &gt; 2". Consequently, diatomic catalysts turn out to be a hot topic in the field of catalytic reactions driven by coupling processes. Currently, catalysts that are loaded on material surfaces with two different single-atom-level metal coordination environments are commonly referred to as diatomic catalysts. Reviews reported to date mainly categorize and study the differences and advantages of homonuclear and heteronuclear bimetallic active centers in diatomic catalysts. However, this conceptual distinction has obscured the impact of spatial configuration differences on catalytic mechanisms. For diatomic catalysts, the differences in coordination environments between the two atoms lead to changes in spatial configuration, which in turn produce specific synergistic effects, greatly influencing the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalytic reactions. With this in mind, this paper, for the first time, clarifies the definition of diatomic catalysts based on different spatial configurations, resolving long-standing confusion. Catalysts with two types of atoms dispersed in isolation without any connection are defined as dual-single-atom catalysts; those with two atoms connected either through a heteroatom bridge or direct bonding are defined as dual-atom catalysts. Additionally, this paper summarizes the latest research progress in the synthesis methods and technical characterization of these two types of catalysts. Furthermore, it explores the mechanisms of dual-core synergy and primary-secondary synergy in dual-single-atom catalysts, as well as the electron effects caused by distance effects and unique functional environments in dual-atom catalysts that contribute to enhancing the catalytic performance of dual-atom catalysts. These are key to achieving the "1 + 1 &gt; 2" catalytic performance in various catalytic fields for both dual-single-atom catalysts and dual-atom catalysts. Further, in the field of electrocatalysis, this paper reviews the structure&#8211;activity relationships of diatomic catalysts for various reactions and focuses on how in situ characterization techniques and first-principles calculations can reveal these relationships in depth. Finally, it explores the challenges faced by dual-atom catalysts and dual-single-atom catalysts in practical applications, offering new perspectives for the rational design and thorough research of efficient dual-atom catalysts and dual-single-atom catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen reduction reaction enhanced by single-atom transition metal catalysts on functionalized graphene: A first-principles study</title>

                Ammonia production seeks alternatives to the conventional Haber-Bosch process, with nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) emerging promising. Addressing the challenge of efficient catalysts, the functionalized graphene-based single atom catalysts (SACs) stand out. While prior studies have favored heteroatom-doped catalysts, the coordination of metal centers with nitrogen atoms remains underexplored. This work investigates transition metal (TM) SACs on nitrogen-doped graphene (N3G) using density functional theory (DFT) for electro-catalytic NRR. Results highlight the stability of V@N3G, Mo@N3G, W@N3G, with binding energies of &#8722;7.77, &#8722;5.43, and &#8722;3.89 eV, respectively. Insights into work function, d-band center, N&#8211;N bond, and IR stretching's role in N2 activation are gained through this study. Bader charge analysis reveals electron redistribution between the support and adsorbed N2. Employing Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) method, comparative free energy diagrams for TM@N3G (V, Mo, W) via., enzymatic, consecutive, alternating, and distal pathways outline potential rate determining step (PDS) with and without the Implicit solvation method. Remarkably, W@N3G catalyst exhibits the lowest PDS in the presence of solvation energy, surpassing other catalysts. The multi-adsorption of N2 on W@N3G enhances NRR process, stabilizing intermediates for efficient ammonia production. This computational study sheds light on metal center SACs on functionalized graphene support as a potential electro-catalyst for efficient and stable NRR.</description>

                Abstract Machine learning models with uncertainty quantification have recently emerged as attractive tools to accelerate the navigation of catalyst design spaces in a data-efficient manner. Here, we combine active learning with a dropout graph convolutional network (dGCN) as a surrogate model to explore the complex materials space of high-entropy alloys (HEAs). We train the dGCN on the formation energies of disordered binary alloy structures in the Pd-Pt-Sn ternary alloy system and improve predictions on ternary structures by performing reduced optimization of the formation free energy, the target property that determines HEA stability, over ensembles of ternary structures constructed based on two coordinate systems: (a) a physics-informed ternary composition space, and (b) data-driven coordinates discovered by the Diffusion Maps manifold learning scheme. Both reduced optimization techniques improve predictions of the formation free energy in the ternary alloy space with a significantly reduced number of DFT calculations compared to a high-fidelity model. The physics-based scheme converges to the target property in a manner akin to a depth-first strategy, whereas the data-driven scheme appears more akin to a breadth-first approach. Both sampling schemes, coupled with our acquisition function, successfully exploit a database of DFT-calculated binary alloy structures and energies, augmented with a relatively small number of ternary alloy calculations, to identify stable ternary HEA compositions and structures. This generalized framework can be extended to incorporate more complex bulk and surface structural motifs, and the results demonstrate that significant dimensionality reduction is possible in thermodynamic sampling problems when suitable active learning schemes are employed.</description>

      <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Ostwald Ripening Reversal Promotes the Formation of Low&#8208;Platinum Intermetallic Fuel Cell Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Strain engineering has been widely used to optimize platinum&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). PtM 3 (M is base metals), a well&#8208;known high&#8208;compressive&#8208;strain intermetallic alloy, shows promise as a low platinum ORR catalyst due to high intrinsic activity. However, during the alloying of Pt with a threefold amount of M, a notable phase separation between Pt and M may occur, with M particles rapidly sintering while Pt particles grow slowly, posing a challenge in achieving a well&#8208;defined PtM 3 intermetallic alloy. Here, an entropy&#8208;driven Ostwald ripening reversal phenomenon is discovered that enables the synthesis of small&#8208;sized Pt(FeCoNiCu) 3 intermetallic ORR catalysts. High entropy promotes the thermodynamic driving force for the alloying Pt with M, which triggers the Ostwald ripening reversal of sintered FeCoNiCu particles and facilitates the formation of uniform Pt(FeCoNiCu) 3 intermetallic catalysts. The prepared Pt(FeCoNiCu) 3 catalysts exhibit a high specific activity of 3.82 mA cm &#8722;2 , along with a power density of &#8776;1.3 W cm &#8722;2 at 0.67 V and 94 &#176;C with a cathode Pt loading of 0.1 mg cm &#8722;2 in H 2 &#8211;air fuel cell.</description>

                Computational modeling of plasmon-mediated molecular photophysical and photochemical behaviors can help us better understand and tune the bound molecular properties and reactivity and make better decisions to design and control nanostructures. However, computational investigations of coupled plasmon&#8211;molecule systems are challenging due to the lack of accurate and efficient protocols to simulate these systems. Here, we present a hybrid scheme by combining the real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) approach with the time-domain frequency dependent fluctuating charge (TD-&#969;FQ) model. At first, we transform &#969;FQ in the frequency-domain, an atomistic electromagnetic model for the plasmonic response of plasmonic metal nanoparticles (PMNPs), into the time-domain and derive its equation-of-motion formulation. The TD-&#969;FQ introduces the nonequilibrium plasmonic response of PMNPs and atomistic interactions to the electronic excitation of the quantum mechanical (QM) region. Then, we combine TD-&#969;FQ with RT-TDDFT. The derived RT-TDDFT/TD-&#969;FQ scheme allows us to effectively simulate the plasmon-mediated &#8220;real-time&#8221; electronic dynamics and even the coupled electron&#8211;nuclear dynamics by combining them with the nuclear dynamics approaches. As a first application of the RT-TDDFT/TD-&#969;FQ method, we study the nonradiative decay rate and plasmon-enhanced absorption spectra of two small molecules in the proximity of sodium MNPs. Thanks to the atomistic nature of the &#969;FQ model, the edge effect of MNP on absorption enhancement has also been investigated and unveiled.</description>

      <description>Mohammad Bagheri, Hannu&#8208;Pekka Komsa, Journal of Raman spectroscopy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399294188

                Abstract Silicate minerals have a rich structural variety consisting of silicon oxide clusters or networks of any dimensionality interdispersed with different types of elements, which is reflected in marked changes in the Raman spectra. Understanding how the changes in the Raman spectra are correlated with the atomic structure would be highly desirable for fast material identification and analysis. Extracting such trends from experimental spectra can be difficult owing to the uncertainties in the structural details of the samples and in ensuring consistency between measurements from different sources. Simulated spectra, however, avoid these problems, making them a good candidate for systematic studies. Here, we study the correlation between the structure and Raman spectral features of 179 silicates derived from a database of Raman spectra simulated using first&#8208;principles calculations. We investigate the spectral similarities with a specific emphasis on materials containing isolated 0D clusters in nesosilicate (SiO 4 ), sorosilicate (Si 2 O 7 ), and cyclosilicate (Si 3 O 9 and Si 4 O 12 ) configurations. While trends identified in the previous reports can be confirmed, we find that the variations within each group of similar structural motifs tend to be larger than the changes across groups, and therefore, developing a reliable automated classification algorithm is likely to be challenging.</description>

                The development of cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts has been a paramount pursuit for advancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a simplified synthesis protocol was designed to achieve a self&#8208;standing electrode, composed of activated carbon paper embedded with Ru single&#8208;atom catalysts and Ru nanoclusters (ACP/Ru SAC+C ) via acid activation, immersion, and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations are employed to gain a more profound understanding of the impact of acid activation on carbon paper. Furthermore, the coexistence states of the Ru atoms are confirmed via aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that introducing a Ru single&#8208;atom site adjacent to the Ru nanoclusters induces a synergistic effect, tuning the electronic structure and thereby significantly enhancing their catalytic performance. Notably, the ACP/Ru SAC+C exhibits a remarkable turnover frequency (TOF) of 18 s &#8722;1 and an exceptional mass activity (MA) of 2.2 A mg &#8722;1 , surpassing the performance of conventional Pt electrodes. The self&#8208;standing electrode, featuring harmoniously coexisting Ru states, stands out as a prospective choice for advancing HER catalysts, enhancing energy efficiency, productivity, and selectivity.</description>

                Water splitting research has drawn a lot of attention recently due to the exhaustion of fossil fuels reserves and the urgent need for sustainable energy options. A potential method for producing clean, effective hydrogen that can be used as a renewable energy source is water splitting. Metal organic framework-based electrocatalysts have become a potential class of materials in this area because of their distinctive characteristics and tunability in terms of metal ion selection, ligand design, and porosity. This article offers a comprehensive review of the enhancements in MOF-based electrocatalysts, divided into monometallic, multimetallic, their composite and derivative categories and their potential applications in water splitting. It explores the unique qualities of these MOFs, highlighting their catalytic power and potential to improve water splitting processes. Harnessing the extraordinary electrocatalytic attributes of MOFs is a pivotal strategy in accelerating the progression towards a future predominantly powered by renewable energy sources.</description>

                We report a comprehensive set of density functional theory calculations on the family of layered antiferromagnetic manganese pnictides $(\mathrm{Ba},\mathrm{Ca},\mathrm{Sr}){\mathrm{Mn}}_{2}{(\mathrm{P},\mathrm{As},\mathrm{Sb})}_{2}$. We characterize all components to the linear magnetoelectric (ME) tensor $\ensuremath{\alpha}$, which are parsed into their contributions from spin and orbital moments for both lattice-mediated and their clamped-ion electronic analogs. Our main results show that the orbital magnetization components cannot be neglected in these systems. The ME response is dominated by electronic effects with total $\ensuremath{\alpha}$ values exceeding those of the prototypical ${\mathrm{Cr}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ (i.e., $\ensuremath{\alpha}\ensuremath{\simeq}6.79$ ps/m in ${\mathrm{BaMn}}_{2}{\mathrm{As}}_{2}$). We also identify a strong correlation with the computed ME susceptibility on pnictogen substitution in the trigonal subfamily albeit with weaker amplitudes ($\ensuremath{\alpha}\ensuremath{\approx}0.2$--1.7 ps/m). Additionally, we provide the dependence of these predictions on the Hubbard $+U$ correction, at the level of the local density approximation, which shows large variations on the calculated ME coefficients in the tetragonal compounds highlighting the role of strong correlation in these compounds.</description>

      <title>Searching COVID-19 Clinical Research Using Graph Queries: Algorithm Development and Validation (Preprint)</title>

                 BACKGROUND Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, &amp;gt;1 million studies have been collected within the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, a corpus of manuscripts created to accelerate research against the disease. Their related abstracts hold a wealth of information that remains largely unexplored and difficult to search due to its unstructured nature. Keyword-based search is the standard approach, which allows users to retrieve the documents of a corpus that contain (all or some of) the words in a target list. This type of search, however, does not provide visual support to the task and is not suited to expressing complex queries or compensating for missing specifications.   OBJECTIVE This study aims to consider small graphs of concepts and exploit them for expressing graph searches over existing COVID-19&#8211;related literature, leveraging the increasing use of graphs to represent and query scientific knowledge and providing a user-friendly search and exploration experience.   METHODS We considered the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset corpus and summarized its content by annotating the publications&#8217; abstracts using terms selected from the Unified Medical Language System and the Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease. Then, we built a co-occurrence network that includes all relevant concepts mentioned in the corpus, establishing connections when their mutual information is relevant. A sophisticated graph query engine was built to allow the identification of the best matches of graph queries on the network. It also supports partial matches and suggests potential query completions using shortest paths.   RESULTS We built a large co-occurrence network, consisting of 128,249 entities and 47,198,965 relationships; the GRAPH-SEARCH interface allows users to explore the network by formulating or adapting graph queries; it produces a bibliography of publications, which are globally ranked; and each publication is further associated with the specific parts of the query that it explains, thereby allowing the user to understand each aspect of the matching.   CONCLUSIONS Our approach supports the process of query formulation and evidence search upon a large text corpus; it can be reapplied to any scientific domain where documents corpora and curated ontologies are made available. </description>

      <title>Ultrathin 2D Alloyed Cu&#8722;Ga&#8722;Zn&#8722;S Curved Nanobelts for Boosting Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

                Abstract 2D semiconductor nanomaterials have received significant attention as photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion due to their robust light absorption capacity, large specific surface area, and superior electron transport characteristics. Nevertheless, it is challenging to develop 2D quaternary copper&#8208;based sulfides (QCSs) with functional integration of conducive structural features for photocatalysis from multiple elements and intricate control conditions. Herein, ultrathin 2D alloyed Cu&#8722;Ga&#8722;Zn&#8722;S (CGZS) curved nanobelts (NBs) are fabricated by using a facile one&#8208;pot colloidal method. Subsequently, the derived Cu 31 S 16 &#8208;CGZS Janus heterostructures are designed by increasing Cu concentrations. The formation mechanism of 2D curved alloys and Janus heterostructures is systematically investigated. Without cocatalysts, curved alloyed CGZS NBs demonstrated superior photocatalytic activities of 1264.2 &#181;mol g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 compared to Janus heterostructured Cu 31 S 16 &#8722;CGZS (463.1 &#181;mol g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 ) under visible light (&gt; 400 nm). Experimental and theoretical results unveiled that the improved photocatalytic activities of curved CGZS NBs can be attributed to enhanced charge&#8211;carrier separation efficiency resulting from high crystallinity and ultrathin 2D structure, abundant active sites from curved structure, high&#8208;active (0001) crystal facet with the lowest reaction Gibbs energy, work function, and metal&#8208;like properties. This work offers new insights into functional integration into ultrathin 2D QCSs with enhanced visible&#8208;light photocatalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Computational exploration of two-dimensional vacancy-free boridene sheet and its derivatives: high stabilities and the promise for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20517/microstructures.2023.80</link>

                The recent synthesis of a two-dimensional (2D) MBene sheet, referred to as the boridene sheet (Mo4B6Tz), has ignited considerable interest in exploring 2D transition metal borides. Boridene has an ordered arrangement of metal vacancies, which are pivotal to its stability. Employing first-principles calculations, we explored the stable phases, electronic properties and catalytic abilities of boridene with different vacancy concentrations (Vm). Our results demonstrate that Vm significantly influences the cohesive energies of boridene sheets. Phonon spectrum and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the high stability of the vacancy-free boridene Mo6B6T6 (T = O, -OH), underscoring their potential for experimental realization. Substituting Mo atoms with Nb, Ta, or W enhances the structural stability of boridene sheets, leading to the identification of four stable variants: Nb6B6F6, Ta6B6F6, Ta6B6O6, and W6B6O6. These boridene sheets exhibit metallic behavior, with five structures displaying near-zero Gibbs free energy for hydrogen atom adsorption, indicating their potential as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The uncovering of vacancy-free boridenes and their 2D derivatives greatly broadens the scope of the MBene family.</description>

      <description>Yeonghun Kang, Jihan Kim, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399290669

                Abstract ChatMOF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is built to predict and generate metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By leveraging a large-scale language model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-3.5-turbo-16k), ChatMOF extracts key details from textual inputs and delivers appropriate responses, thus eliminating the necessity for rigid and formal structured queries. The system is comprised of three core components (i.e., an agent, a toolkit, and an evaluator) and it forms a robust pipeline that manages a variety of tasks, including data retrieval, property prediction, and structure generations. ChatMOF shows high accuracy rates of 96.9% for searching, 95.7% for predicting, and 87.5% for generating tasks with GPT-4. Additionally, it successfully creates materials with user-desired properties from natural language. The study further explores the merits and constraints of utilizing large language models (LLMs) in combination with database and machine learning in material sciences and showcases its transformative potential for future advancements.</description>

                The demand for green hydrogen has raised concerns over the availability of iridium used in oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. We identify catalysts with the aid of a machine learning-aided computational pipeline trained on more than 36,000 mixed metal oxides. The pipeline accurately predicts Pourbaix decomposition energy (Gpbx) from unrelaxed structures with a mean absolute error of 77 meV per atom, enabling us to screen 2070 new metallic oxides with respect to their prospective stability under acidic conditions. The search identifies Ru0.6Cr0.2Ti0.2O2 as a candidate having the promise of increased durability: experimentally, we find that it provides an overpotential of 267 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 and that it operates at this current density for over 200 h and exhibits a rate of overpotential increase of 25 &#956;V h&#8211;1. Surface density functional theory calculations reveal that Ti increases metal&#8211;oxygen covalency, a potential route to increased stability, while Cr lowers the energy barrier of the HOO* formation rate-determining step, increasing activity compared to RuO2 and reducing overpotential by 40 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 while maintaining stability. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ex situ ptychography-scanning transmission X-ray microscopy show the evolution of a metastable structure during the reaction, slowing Ru mass dissolution by 20&#215; and suppressing lattice oxygen participation by &gt;60% compared to RuO2.</description>

                We report a fast and easy method (PACMAN) to assign partial atomic charges on metal-organic framework (MOF) and covalent-organic framework (COF) crystal structures based on graph convolution networks (GCNs) trained on &gt;1.8 million high-fidelity partial atomic charge data obtained from the Quantum Metal-Organic Framework (QMOF) database. The developed model shows outstanding performance, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0055 e (test set performance) while maintaining consistency with DDEC6, Bader, and CM5 charges across diverse chemistry and topologies of MOFs and COFs. We find that the new method accurately assigns partial atomic charges for ion-containing nanoporous materials, which has not been possible in previous machine learning (ML) models.

      <title>Prediction of Electronic Density of States in Guanine-TiO2 Adsorption Model based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbr.2024.100008</link>

                The electronic density of states is a property of the material that is extensively used in quantum systems in condensed matter physics. It refers to the energy level of the electrons in a solid crystal. One of the most current ways to compute it is by Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB), given the geometry of the material. Nevertheless, this computation could be very computationally demanding, although applied to some materials with a very reduced number of atoms. This paper presents a method to deduce the electronic density of states, which is based on a neural network, thus, almost linear with respect to the number of atoms in the material. Specifically, we have applied our method to a metal oxide structure interacting with a nucleic base guanine. We have focused on stoichiometric and O-defective anatase TiO2 (101) surfaces. The data set of the electronic density of states needed to train the neural network has been obtained by a DFTB+ numerical solver given an initial molecular geometry model, which computed a track of time-dependent geometry and their associated electronic density of states. We validated that the predicted electronic density of states deduced by our method and by DFTB tends to be very similar, thus, opening the door to other computations such that introducing our method in the process of generating the time-dependent geometry analysis.</description>
