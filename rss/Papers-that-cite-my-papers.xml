      <title>Cone-Shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton Method: Efficient and Robust Single-Ended Transition State Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01015</link>
      <description>Yuanbang Wu, Haifeng Wang, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414009387

                Efficient transition state location is a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. While single-ended methods are more efficient than double-ended methods, their convergence is often highly sensitive to the quality of the initial guess. Here, we propose a Cone-shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton (CCQN) method, which introduces a cone-shaped constraint to restrict the search direction, thereby effectively guiding the system from potential well regions toward saddle regions. After crossing the inflection curve, the optimization switches to the partitioned rational function optimization algorithm for further refinement. This curvature partitioned optimization strategy reduces the sensitivity to the quality of the initial guess while maintaining the efficiency of single-ended methods. Across 150 transition state optimization tasks with varying initial guess qualities, CCQN achieves an overall success rate of 93.3%, requiring only approximately 50 energy-force evaluations on average. The method exhibits strong robustness and convergence efficiency, offering a new tool for high-throughput transition state searches and mechanistic studies of complex catalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Effects of Spin State and Intermediate Hydrogen Adsorption on NiPt/Ni Bridge Sites toward Robust Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c04035</link>
      <description>Shan Li, Yue Feng, Hao Tan, Kai Zeng, Wenjun Fan, Kuanping Gong, Xingqiao Wu, Chaohua Dai, Weirong Chen, Xin Tan, Sean C. Smith, Yibing Li, Nano Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414012476

                Precise modulation of the electronic structure in transition metals, particularly the d-band center position and spin state, remains a critical challenge to expediting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Herein, we report a NiPt/Ni-heterostructured catalyst enabling simultaneous optimization of the d-band electronic structure and spin state of Ni through regulation of the NiPt and Ni bridge sites. Combining operando spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we establish that the coordination environment and spin states of Ni at the bridge sites were effectively modulated by altering the Pt content, achieving a transition of Ni centers from the low-spin to high-spin state, and optimized intermediate adsorption/desorption behaviors. The resulting NiPt/Ni catalyst exhibits an exceptional HER performance in acidic media, achieving a benchmark current density of -10 mA cm-2 at a mere 9.8 mV overpotential and delivering an industrial-scale 1.0 A cm-2 current density in PEM electrolysis at 1.75 V.</description>

      <title>Electrodeposition of oxide-carbide composites of CrFeCoNiMo and measurement of catalytic activity on oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Abstract Many high-entropy oxides exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting. In this study, a coating of oxide-carbide composites containing Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo was electrodeposited in a C 2 H 6 SO (DMSO)-based solution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of carbides, oxides, and oxygen vacancies. Except for some metallic nickel, most metals exist in the oxidized or hydroxide states. Aqua- and chloro-complexes of metal ions have been proposed to form oxides and carbides on copper via the reduction of hydrated water and organic molecules. The coating exhibited high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, achieving an overpotential of 216 mV, corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm. The long-term stability at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 was investigated for 50 h, with a stable overpotential and minor surface dissolution. The catalytic activity was determined using density functional theory, and the unsaturated oxidation number of the metal atoms was calculated to depict the relationship between the binding state and the overpotential of the active sites.

      <title>MatterGPT: A Generative Transformer for Multi-Property Inverse Design of Solid-State Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7463697/v1</link>
      <description>Lei Wang, Yan Chen, Xueru Wang, Xiaobin Deng, Yilun Liu, Xi Chen, Jun Zhang, Yunwei Zhang, Hang Xiao, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024291

                Abstract Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties remains a central challenge in materials science, requiring exploration of vast chemical spaces containing potentially 10100 possible structures. Current generative approaches face limitations in computational efficiency, multi-property targeting precision and mechanistic interpretability. Here, we introduce MatterGPT, an autoregressive Transformer-decoder architecture that leverages SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) representation to generate novel crystals through conditional next-token prediction. Trained on 306,533 crystal structures, MatterGPT achieves &gt; 99% structural validity, &gt; 99% structural uniqueness and &gt; 50% novelty rates while targeting both specific lattice-insensitive and lattice-sensitive properties. Critically, MatterGPT enables direct multi-property generation without post-generation filtering. Interpretability analysis reveals clear property-guided generation mechanisms and systematic chemical space exploration. The comprehensive open-source release, including MatterGPT Hub integration platform, establishes sequence-based autoregressive generation as a computationally efficient and interpretable paradigm for inverse crystal design, accelerating materials discovery across energy storage, electronics, and functional applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Modeling of Rare Earth Ions in Photonic Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bio.70297</link>
      <description>Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Mohd Zulkifli Bin Mohamad Noor, Masoud Darvish Ganji, Leonardo Goliatt, Luminescence. 40(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024557

                ABSTRACT Rare&#8208;earth ions (REIs), especially trivalent lanthanides (Ln), are central to photonic technologies due to sharp intra&#8208;4f transitions, long lifetimes, and host&#8208;insensitive emission. However, modeling REIs remains challenging due to localized 4f orbitals, strong electron correlation, and multiplet structures. This review summarizes atomistic modeling strategies combining quantum chemistry and machine learning (ML). Traditional methods, DFT+, hybrid functionals (HSE06), , and DMFT, are benchmarked; for example, hybrid DFT reproduces 4f&#8211;5d gaps in Ce:YAG within 0.1&#8211;0.2 eV. Wavefunction methods like CASSCF and CASPT2 capture Stark splittings and transition strengths in Eu:Y SiO. ML models trained on DFT data predict bandgaps with 0.2 eV error and aid inverse design of Ce&#8208;doped phosphors with 505 nm emission and 60% retention at 640 K. Unlike prior reviews, this work bridges high&#8208;level quantum modeling with ML&#8208;driven screening across key applications: upconversion (Yb&#8211;Er:NaYF), lasers (Nd:YAG), quantum memories (Pr:Y SiO), and sensors (SrAl O:Eu, Dy). Covering over 20 REI&#8211;host systems, it integrates insights from DFT, Monte Carlo, MD, and ML potentials. The review thus provides both a methodological guide and a resource for designing next&#8208;generation REI&#8208;based photonic materials.</description>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) are a promising technology for large-scale hydrogen production, yet their industrial deployment is hindered by the harsh acidic conditions and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in iridium-based electrocatalysts (IBEs), emphasizing novel optimization strategies to enhance both catalytic activity and durability. Specifically, we critically examine the mechanistic insights into OER under acidic conditions, revealing key degradation pathways of Ir species. We further highlight innovative approaches for IBE design, including (i) morphology and support engineering to improve stability, (ii) structure and phase modulation to enhance catalytic efficiency, and (iii) electronic structure tuning for optimizing interactions with reaction intermediates. Additionally, we assess emerging electrode engineering strategies and explore the potential of non-precious metal-based alternatives. Finally, we propose future research directions, focusing on rational catalyst design, mechanistic clarity, and scalable fabrication for industrial applications. By integrating these insights, this review provides a strategic framework for advancing PEMWE technology through highly efficient and durable OER catalysts. Graphical Abstract In order to realize the efficient application of the industrial PEMWEs, material design strategies for stimulating the activity and stability capability of OER electrocatalysts are summarized, including (i) morphology/support effects, (ii) structure/phase engineering, (iii) electronic configuration/interaction. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism is deeply clarified, and electrode engineering and challenges of IBEs in practical PEMWE application are focused.</description>

      <title>High Performance Monometallic Platinum Fuel Cell Catalyst Derived from Self&#8208;Hole&#8208;Confined Nanoparticles and Nitrogen&#8208;Anchored Single&#8208;Atoms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202500853</link>
      <description>Wei Li, Yunyan Li, Qi Xiong, Dan Song, Chungang Min, Hao Li, Feng Tan, Feng Liu, Xikun Yang, Small Methods. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414026408

                Abstract Platinum and non&#8208;precious metal (PtM) alloy multimetallic catalysts have been developed to address the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathodes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, these catalysts inevitably suffer from poor lot&#8208;to&#8208;lot consistency of chemical compositions and structures during production, and the transition metal leaching in practical applications. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance monometallic Pt catalysts using innovative nanoarchitectures has become important to address the technical challenges that hinder the widespread deployment of the PEMFCs. Here, a monometallic Pt catalyst is developed, which composes of self&#8208;hole&#8208;confined Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;anchored Pt single&#8208;atoms. The monometallic Pt catalyst exhibits high ORR activity and durability, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multimetallic PtM alloy catalysts. A membrane electrode assembly utilizing the monometallic Pt catalyst as a cathode demonstrated a mass activity of 0.87 A mg Pt &#8722;1 @ 0.9 V iR&#8208;free . After undergoing 30000 square&#8208;wave cycles, the assembly exhibited a 23% decline in mass activity and a potential drop of 16 mV at 0.8 A cm &#8722;2 . The results of this study would lead to a critical breakthrough in the performance of monometallic Pt catalysts utilized in PEMFCs.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Ni&#8208;Based Reconstructed Surface for Electrocatalytic Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202500736</link>

                The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis lead to high overpotentials, limiting cost-effective green hydrogen production. Ni-based catalysts, recognized as promising OER electrocatalysts, require electronic structure modulation to enhance performance. However, under oxidizing conditions, Ni-based materials undergo surface reconstruction with significant electronic alterations, rendering bulk-phase studies less practical. Recent efforts focus on regulating reconstructed surface electronic structures for improved efficiency, underscoring the need for a systematic review on this critical topic. This review highlights the fundamental progress regarding the electronic structure regulation of reconstructed surface of Ni-based OER electrocatalysts for better understanding the surface reconstruction process and the structure-activity relationship, including the basic understanding of OER mechanism and surface reconstruction of Ni-based materials, the principles and practical applications of key electronic structure descriptors with their respective advantages and limitations, and recent advancements and developing bottle-necks in surface reconstruction chemistry across diverse Ni-based OER catalyst systems. Finally, the challenges facing surface reconstruction of Ni-based OER catalysts are summarized, and several future prospects are proposed to guide the in-depth analysis of the reconstruction mechanism and the rational design of Ni-based OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Correction to the Adsorption Free Energy of Oxygen-Containing Intermediates on Pt(111) by Machine-Learned Force Field-Based Thermodynamic Integrations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c03465</link>
      <description>Thanh-Nam Huynh, Bassim Mounssef, Dmitry Sharapa, Felix Studt, Tom&#225;&#353; Bu&#269;ko, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414039479

                Accurate and efficient descriptions of adsorption free energy are of fundamental importance to bringing theoretical findings closer to experiments. The present study introduced a robust combination of machine learning and (un)constrained molecular dynamics-based &#955;-path thermodynamic integration methods to accurately estimate the anharmonic correction to the free energy of adsorbing systems and, thus, the adsorption free energy. The approach was demonstrated for the adsorptions of the oxygenated species exhibiting different anharmonic behaviors, namely, atomic oxygen (O), hydroxyl (OH), and hydroperoxyl (OOH), on the Pt(111) surface. The corrected adsorption free energies reveal the significant influence of anharmonic effects, which could account for up to 39% of the entropy loss estimated by the conventional harmonic approximation, even at near room temperature. This highlights the limitations of the current harmonic approximation and underscores the need to account for anharmonicity for better descriptions of the adsorption processes. The present method paves the way for the accurate adsorption of free energy calculations to be performed routinely toward more powerful theoretical predictions of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.</description>

      <title>Oxophilic Sites Mediated Dynamic Oxygen Replenishment to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen Catalysis in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>

                Developing efficient and durable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is essential for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, catalyst instability caused by lattice oxygen (OL) depletion and metal dissolution remains a critical barrier. Here, we propose an oxophilic-site-mediated dynamic oxygen replenishment mechanism (DORM), in which OL actively participates in O-O bond formation and is continuously refilled by water-derived species. Oxophilic dopants modulate the local electronic structure, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy healing, and reorganize the interfacial hydrogen-bond network to enhance water mobility, orientation, and proton accessibility, collectively promoting water dissociation and stabilizing OL catalysis. The optimized catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 289 mV and exceptional durability, operating continuously for 650 h at 10 mA cm-2 in acidic electrolyte and maintaining stable performance for 280 h at 1 A cm-2 in a PEMWE. This work establishes a mechanistic framework for dynamic OL redox and provides a rational strategy for designing robust, noble-metal-free acidic OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Mars&#8211;van Krevelen Mechanism for CO Capture on the Surface of Carbides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules30173637</link>

                Electrochemical reduction processes enable the CO to be converted into a useful chemical fuel. Our study employs density functional theory calculations to analyze the (110) facets of the transition metal carbide surfaces for CO capture, incorporating the Mars&#8211;van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. All the possible adsorption sites on the surface, including carbon, metal, and bridge sites, were fully investigated. The findings indicate that the carbon site is more active relative to the other adsorption sites examined. The CO hydrogenation paths have been comprehensively investigated on all the surfaces, and the free energy diagrams have been constructed towards the product. The results conclude that the TiC is the most promising candidate for the formation of methane, exhibiting an onset potential of &#8722;0.44 V. The predicted onset potential for CrC, MoC, NbC, VC, WC, ZrC, and HfC are &#8722;0.86, &#8722;0.61, &#8722;0.61, &#8722;0.93, &#8722;0.87, &#8722;0.61, and &#8722;0.81 V, respectively. Our calculated results demonstrate that MvK is selectively relevant to methane synthesis. Additionally, we investigated the stability of these surfaces against decomposition and conversion to pure metals concerning thermodynamics and kinetics. It was found that these carbides could remain stable under ambient conditions. The exergonic adsorption of hydrogen on carbon sites, requiring smaller potential values for product formation, and stability against decomposition indicate that these surfaces are highly suitable for CO reduction reactions using the MvK mechanism.</description>

                The research community in the electrochemical field is increasingly moving toward device-level investigations in a push to demonstrate practical applicability and widen the adoption of advanced energy conversion and storage technologies. Electrochemical devices, however, are highly complex systems and require a multidisciplinary approach to reveal the fundamental processes and key physical parameters of the materials employed that determine their functional properties. These processes occur in the near-surface region of the electrodes that catalyze electrochemical reactions. Here, we present our view on the critical importance and enduring relevance of a surface science approach to advance knowledge in electrocatalysis, with foundations built on well-defined planar surfaces that could be linked to corresponding nanostructured interfaces.</description>

      <title>Strong Trapping Capability and Diffusion Suppression Effect of Silicon Carbide Surface on Tritium: A First Principle Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5c10266</link>
      <description>Ziling Zhou, Zhengzhe Qu, Mengjie Wu, Yu Wang, Feng Xie, Jiejuan Tong, Yanwei Wen, Bin Shan, Feng Xie, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414070079

                Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted considerable interest for use in electronics, aerospace, and nuclear energy applications owing to its excellent electrical and mechanical properties. In the nuclear industry, SiC serves as an effective tritium permeation barrier. However, a significant discrepancy remains between the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients and the theoretical predictions. In addition, a steep tritium concentration gradient exists near the surface, whereas the concentration remains nearly uniform through the bulk, a phenomenon that is not yet fully understood. In this study, first-principles calculations were performed to investigate the influences of vacancies, grain boundaries, and surfaces on tritium diffusion in 3C-SiC. Vacancies and grain boundaries were found to have a negligible impact on the effective diffusion coefficient. In contrast, the surface exhibited a high diffusion barrier, demonstrating a strong tritium-trapping behavior. Incorporation of the surface effect into a multilayer diffusion model resulted in good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results, while also explaining the observed steep concentration gradient near the surface. These findings enhance the fundamental understanding of the tritium behavior in SiC and provide theoretical guidance for the design of high-performance tritium permeation barrier materials.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Halide Perovskites: An Emerging Electrocatalyst for Oxygen and Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adsu.202500713</link>

                Abstract Halide perovskites are a significant class of compounds with ABX 3 crystal structure and have shown remarkable potential in renewable energy applications such as supercapacitors, photocatalysis, and photo&#8208;electrocatalysis. Their efficient charge carrier mobility, superior optoelectronic properties derived from optimal bandgap and tunable composition are beneficial for the applications of halide perovskites in the sustainable energy conversion and storage field. This review highlights the inherent potential of halide perovskites as electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen electrocatalysis. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are the bottlenecks for sustainable water splitting reactions, for fuel cells, metal&#8208;air batteries, etc., which require electrocatalysts that offer good activity and excellent stability. Though noble metal catalysts offer thriving performance, their cost and stability&#8208;related issues hinder their widespread usage. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based perovskite oxide has already established its stronghold in electrocatalysis. Similarly, their halogen counterpart, perovskite halides, also prove to be efficient contenders for noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. In this review, various suitable synthesis techniques, mechanisms, and the electrocatalytic activity of halide perovskites are discussed. This review aims to show yet another class of compounds (halide perovskites) to the researcher community that strives for the development of noble metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Hierarchical, and Object-Oriented Electronic Structure Interfaces for Direct Nonadiabatic Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00878</link>
      <description>Sascha Mausenberger, Severin Polonius, Sebastian Mai, Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414084320

                We present a novel, flexible framework for electronic structure interfaces designed for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, implemented in Python 3 using concepts of object-oriented programming. This framework streamlines the development of new interfaces by providing a reusable and extendable code base. It supports the computation of energies, gradients, various couplings&#9472;like spin-orbit couplings, nonadiabatic couplings, and transition dipole moments&#9472;and other properties for an arbitrary number of states with any multiplicities and charges. A key innovation within this framework is the introduction of hybrid interfaces, which can use other interfaces in a general hierarchical manner. Hybrid interfaces are capable of using one or more child interfaces to implement multiscale approaches, such as quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics where different child interfaces are assigned to different regions of a system. The concept of hybrid interfaces can be extended through nesting, where hybrid parent interfaces use hybrid child interfaces to easily setup complex workflows without the need for additional coding. We demonstrate the versatility of hybrid interfaces with two examples: one at the method level and one at the workflow level. The first example showcases the numerical differentiation of wave function overlaps, implemented as a hybrid interface and used to optimize a minimum-energy conical intersection with numerical nonadiabatic couplings. The second example presents an adaptive learning workflow, where nested hybrid interfaces are used to iteratively refine a machine learning model. This work lays the groundwork for more modular, flexible, and scalable software design in excited-state dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transition State Search and Ligand Screening for Organometallic Catalysis with Reactive Machine Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01047</link>
      <description>Kun Tang, Yujing Zhao, Lei Zhang, Jian Du, Qingwei Meng, Qilei Liu, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414084992

                Organometallic catalysis lies at the heart of numerous industrial processes that produce bulk and fine chemicals. The search for transition states and screening for organic ligands are vital in designing highly active organometallic catalysts with efficient reaction kinetics. However, identifying accurate transition states necessitates computationally intensive quantum chemistry calculations. In this work, a reactive machine learning potential (RMLP) model is developed to accelerate transition state optimizations and ligand screening for organometallic catalysis based on an automated transition state database construction method and a higher-order equivariant message passing neural network. In case studies involving the ethylene hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by organometallic catalysts, RMLP rapidly predicts potential energy surfaces along intrinsic reaction coordinate paths, achieving speeds nearly 3 orders of magnitude faster than those of rigorous quantum chemistry calculations. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.307 &#197; for transition state geometries and a mean absolute error of 0.871 kJ&#183;mol-1 for reaction barriers on the external test set, significantly outperforming semiempirical quantum chemistry methods. Our RMLP model offers an effective alternative to both rigorous and semiempirical quantum chemistry approaches for rapid and precise transition state optimizations, facilitating high-throughput screening of advanced organometallic catalyst ligands.</description>

                In the digital era, ensuring the security, authenticity, and accessibility of academic credentials is crucial. Traditional credentialing and academic record-keeping systems suffer from inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and verification issues. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent solution to these challenges. This chapter explores blockchain's potential in academic credentialing, examining its benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. Academic institutions currently rely on centralized authorities, which can be inefficient and susceptible to fraud. Blockchain provides an immutable ledger that enables secure issuance, decentralized verification, and fraud prevention. By leveraging cryptographic security and smart contracts, institutions can issue digital diplomas and certificates that are instantly verifiable, eliminating the need for intermediary verification. Blockchain also enhances lifelong learning records by allowing students to consolidate academic achievements into a single digital identity. This improves global mobility.</description>

                The development of efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for advancing sustainable energy systems and enabling the widespread adoption of hydrogen&#8208;based energy technologies. In this study, we discover a stable hexagonal V 2 B 2 monolayer that serves as a promising HER catalyst via an unbiased swarm&#8208;intelligence structural method as implemented in CALYPSO code. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the predicted V 2 B 2 monolayer exhibits excellent metallic properties and promising catalytic activity for HER, suggesting CALYPSO's utility for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts. Further doping engineering, incorporating transition metals (TM&#8242; = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf), reveals that the introduction of Sc, Y, and Zr significantly enhances the catalytic performance. Bader charge analysis reveals a linear correlation between the electron gain by the hydrogen atom and &#916; G H* , suggesting that this relationship could serve as an effective descriptor for HER activity in TM'&#8208;doped V 2 B 2 systems. Our findings provide valuable insights into nonprecious HER electrocatalysts and contribute to a deeper understanding of high catalytic performance in newly proposed 2D HER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Computational Study to Assess the Influence of Elastic Strains on the Catalytic Activity of Au Surfaces for the HER and ORR Including the Effect of Coverage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c01962</link>

                The influence of different surface coverages and the effect of biaxial elastic strains on the catalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were analyzed using the example of a Au fcc(111) surface. The adsorption energies of H, O, and OH for the corresponding intermediate reactions were obtained by density functional theory calculations. While for H and O, the adsorption energy increased with coverage, for OH, the lowest adsorption energy was observed at 0.5 ML. Then, after elastic strains were applied, the trends observed for the unstrained slab were maintained for the three adsorbates. Although neither tension nor compression modified the optimum coverage, they did change the differences in relative energies. This is considered to be a consequence of the deformations promoted on the surface. Finally, the catalytic activity of the HER and ORR was computed for the distinct coverages and elastic strains. Catalytic activity plots confirmed for both reactions that the more favorable adsorption energy promoted by tensile strains leads to an increment of the activity and that the most active coverage is 0.25 ML. Furthermore, an analysis of the free energies of each step of the dissociative mechanism of the ORR unveils that both coverage and elastic strains can modify the rate-limiting step and, therefore, the catalytic activity of a material. The results presented in this work provide ample characterization of the Au fcc(111) surface as a catalyst for the HER and ORR and offer, for the first time, an analysis of the influence of both coverage and elastic strain engineering on the catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Surface Hydroxylated Mn-Doped RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as an Efficient and Stable Electrocatalyst for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04487</link>
      <description>Qian Dang, Zhe Shang, Fengmei Wang, Xiaoming Sun, Hui Li, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414112879

                The role of surface hydroxylation in the performance of RuO2-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial but still unclear. Using first-principles calculations, we comprehensively studied the impact of surface hydroxylation states on the activity and stability of Mn-doped RuO2-based electrocatalysts (denoted as nOH-Mn0.1Ru0.9O2, n = 1&#8211;5) in acidic OER. It was revealed that the moderately hydroxylated Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 demonstrates better performance than the fully hydroxylated structure, and 4OH-Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 holds the lowest reaction barrier of 0.14 eV in solvation under the constant potential of 1.5 V, which is lower than those of both pure RuO2 (0.28 eV) and Mn0.1Ru0.9O2 (0.23 eV). Such an increase in catalytic activity stems from the nonstrong-and-nonweak charge transfer of reaction sites. In addition, the synergistic effect of doping and hydroxylation can also increase the stability of RuO2 through inhibition of structure collapse caused by the dissolution of Ru and the loss of lattice oxygen. The present study has provided a novel strategy for the design of efficient and stable RuO2-based acidic OER catalysts through surface hydroxylation.</description>

      <title>Repurposing polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste to capture carbon dioxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adv5906</link>

                Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a ubiquitous polymer with a lack of viable waste management solutions besides mechanical recycling, incineration, and landfilling. Herein, we demonstrate a chemical upcycling of PET waste into materials for CO2 capture via aminolysis. The aminolysis reaction products-a bis-aminoamide (BAETA) and oligomers-exhibit high CO2 capture capacity up to 3.4 moles per kilogram as a stand-alone organic solid material. BAETA shows strong chemisorption featuring high selectivity for CO2 capture from flue gas (5 to 20% CO2) and ambient air (~400 parts per million CO2) under humid conditions. Our thermally stable material (&gt;250&#176;C) enables CO2 capture at high temperatures (up to 170&#176;C) for multiple cycles. Scalability of the material production was demonstrated by performing aminolysis of untreated consumer waste PET of 1 kilogram. Our approach introduces a simple and straightforward solution that can address both plastic waste and carbon dioxide, offering a potential pathway toward net negative emissions.</description>

      <title>Future Perspective On Materials, Electrochemistry, and Cell Concepts for Redox&#8208;Mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Direct Air Capture Scenarios</title>

                Anthropogenic emissions of previously sequestered carbon continue to disrupt the natural carbon cycle, driving atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations beyond 420 ppm. This has resulted in global temperatures rising beyond 1.5 &#176;C above the pre&#8208;industrial level. Direct air capture (DAC) of CO 2 has emerged as a complementary mitigation strategy. However, current DAC technologies are limited by the high energy requirements inherent to the thermal release of captured CO 2 , which are caused by the low thermodynamic efficiency of heat&#8208;driven processes, as constrained by Carnot principles. Redox&#8208;mediated electrochemical carbon capture (RMECC) offers a promising pathway to overcome these limitations. RMECC with DAC application remains in an early developmental stage and requires further optimization to enable energy&#8208;efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable deployment. In this perspective the design of sorbents, electrolytes, and electrochemical cell configurations in the field of RMECC are discussed with an emphasis on sustainable approaches for the demands of DAC applications. The challenges arising from the atmospheric dilution of CO 2 within the more abundant and disruptive competitor oxygen are highlighted as a critical factor influencing sorbent performance. Recent advancements in RMECC are reviewed, key challenges are identified, and future directions are outlined to accelerate electrochemically mediated DAC towards practical implementation.</description>
