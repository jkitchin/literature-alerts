      <title>Competitive Strain Modulation of Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Monolayer Binary Alloy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-j9g93</link>
      <description>Mailde S. Oz&#243;rio, Marcus Frahm Nygaard, Jan Rossmeisl, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401956928

                Binary alloys of transition metals are promising catalytic materials for the cathodic oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) of polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, a lack of understanding of the factors that affect the ORR's catalytic performance hampers the catalytic applications of binary alloys. To obtain further knowledge of binary alloys for efficient ORR, we investigate the activity of monolayer AuxPt1-x alloy surfaces supported on Pt(111), considering from random distribution until phase-segregated surface atoms. Using the *OH adsorption energy as a descriptor, we found that the activity of monolayer binary alloy surfaces depends on the distribution of the surface atoms within surfaces with segregated Pt and Au domains showing higher activity. The adsorption energy of *OH increases with the fraction n of Au near the adsorption site and decreases with the fraction p of Au outside the heptamer. The energy increase due to n is related to a tensile strain, while the decrease with the increase of p is due to a long-range surface strain effect on the Pt-Pt and Pt-Au bonds, improving the activity of the available Pt adsorption sites. Due to the weak *OH adsorption energy on Au sites, an Au overall percentage considerably above the Pt percentage starts to reduce surface activity because of the reduction of the number of very active Pt sites.</description>

      <title>Facilitation of Pd&#8211;Ru Mixing in Nanoalloys of Immiscible Palladium and Ruthenium by NO Adsorption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c03350</link>
      <description>Y&#363;suke Nanba, Masaaki Haneda, Michihisa Koyama, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401939920

                Surface formation markedly influences the stability and properties of nanoalloys. The surface states of nanoalloys are sensitive to the constituent elements and to the surrounding environment. In this study, Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and an evolution strategy (ES) combined with density functional theory calculations and multivariate analysis were used to explore the stable configuration of NO-adsorbed PdRu nanoalloys. FT-IR analysis indicated that the NO molecules were adsorbed on the Ru-related sites, which was inconsistent with the stable surface state of the isolated PdRu nanoalloy models. The ES revealed that the stable surface state consisted mainly of Ru atoms owing to molecular adsorption. In addition, the Pd&#8211;Ru mixing was facilitated by the adsorption. According to the multivariate analysis, the adsorption energies on the Ru-related sites were more negative than those on the Pd-related sites and became more negative as the number of neighboring Pd atoms increased. These adsorption characteristics are opposite to those of the stability of the isolated PdRu nanoalloys. The energy gain owing to NO adsorption overcomes the energy loss due to the Pd&#8211;Ru bonds and placement of Ru atoms at the surface. This study highlights the importance of understanding stable surface states in a reactive atmosphere for the application of nanoalloys.</description>

      <title>Cobalt Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Photo/Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aesr.202400169</link>

                Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#8208;based catalysts have garnered significant interest as efficient materials for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) due to their abundant availability, low cost, tunable electronic structures, and unique light absorption performance. This review offers a thorough examination of the latest developments in CoPc&#8208;based catalysts for HER. It entails a wide range of synthesis approaches, intrinsic characteristics, and catalytic mechanisms associated with these catalysts for HER. We also compare the photo/electrocatalytic performance of these catalysts using parameters like Tafel slope, exchange current density, overpotential, hydrogen yield, turnover frequency, stability, specific surface area, etc. The review shows that the commonly used electrolytes for electrocatalytic HER are KOH, LiClO 4 /PBS, and H 2 SO 4 , while for photocatalytic HER, triethylamine, water, and triethanolamine are frequently used. Among all the electrocatalysts understudied, poly[CoOTPc]&#8208;KB and GO/4N&#8208;CoPc are the best, owing to their lowest overpotentials and Tafel slopes. In terms of photocatalytic hydrogen production, CoPc/TiO 2 /Pt has better photocatalytic HER performance compared to its counterparts. This review also highlights the effects of incorporating CoPc with different materials on the photo/electrocatalytic HER performance. Furthermore, the review discusses the challenges and prospects, emphasizing the chances for improving and incorporating CoPc&#8208;based catalysts as a viable option for hydrogen production in the future.</description>

      <title>CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Activation and Dissociation on Exsolved Ni/La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Catalysts: A First-Principles Study</title>

                In this study, we performed spin-polarized periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations to understand the electronic structure and catalytic activity of exsolved Ni nanoparticles supported on La2O3 (i.e., Ni/La2O3) as reported in the recent experimental literature. We used simple slab models to study the electronic structure and reactivity of the Ni/La2O3 overlayer surfaces. The modifications in the electronic and geometric properties of Ni/La2O3 as successive layers of Ni are added on top of La2O3 are systematically investigated by using the d-band model as well as by studying the adsorption and dissociation of CO2. We examined the interaction of CO2 on the surface of Ni/La2O3 by computing adsorption energetics, optimized geometries, charge transfer, and density of states. As the interaction between CO2 and the Ni surface is weak, we employed van der Waal corrections in our calculations. Our results suggest that the adsorption of CO2 is more favorable on the Ni/La2O3 surface compared to that on the simple Ni(111) surface. Furthermore, we have also found that the activation barrier for CO2 dissociation increases with an increase in the number of Ni layers from one layer to three and that the energy of the reaction becomes less exothermic. This shows that the dissociation of CO2 becomes both kinetically and thermodynamically less favorable as we increase the number of Ni layers over La2O3. Thus, a single monolayer of Ni/La2O3 is the most active among the surfaces investigated here for the adsorption and dissociation of CO2. We show how this is due to the synergistic effect of geometric and electronic factors. The energetics of the CO2 dissociation reaction follow a Bro&#823;nsted&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi relationship where the activation energy is linearly correlated to the reaction energy for all the surfaces studied here. The present study's findings offer valuable perspectives on the correlation between the electronic configuration and catalytic capabilities of Ni/La2O3 catalysts. Consequently, these insights are expected to be useful in the design of novel, high-performance, supported metal catalysts for a range of important reactions.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Mechanistic Pathways of N2 Reduction to Ammonia on (110) Facets of Transition Metal Carbides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cryst14090770</link>

                The conversion of molecular dinitrogen into ammonia under mild conditions is a significant pursuit in chemistry due to its potential for sustainable and clean ammonia production. The electrochemical reduction of N2 offers a promising route for achieving this goal with reduced energy consumption, utilizing renewable energy sources. However, the exploration of effective electrocatalysts for this process, particularly at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, remains under exploration. This study addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation of potential catalysts for nitrogen electro-reduction to ammonia under ambient conditions. Using density functional theory calculations, we explore the (110) facets of rock salt structures across 11 transition metal carbides. Catalytic activity is evaluated through the construction of free energy diagrams for associative, dissociative, and Mars&#8211;van Krevelen reaction mechanisms. Additionally, we assess material stability against electrochemical poisoning and decomposition of parent metals during operation. Our findings suggest that a few of the candidates are promising for nitrogen reduction reactions, such as TaC and WC, with moderate onset potentials (&#8722;0.66 V and &#8722;0.82 V vs. RHE) under ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional Electrocatalyst&#8211;Driven Hybrid Water Splitting for Energy&#8208;Saving Coproduction of Green H &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Valuable Chemicals</title>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting to generate green H 2 with renewable energy inputs is attractive to relieve the environmental contamination and energy dilemma. Restricted by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and single functionality of cathode/anode catalysts, conventional overall water splitting (OWS) suffers from high overpotentials and respective synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts, leading to high cost. Moreover, the generated O 2 bears low value and its possible mixing with H 2 poses safety issues. In response, hybrid water splitting (HWS) that integrates hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable oxidative upgrading reactions over bifunctional electrocatalysts can generate H 2 and value-added chemicals simultaneously with lower energy input and avoid the explosive H 2 /O 2 mixtures. Hence, this chapter focuses on the recent progress in bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8211;driven HWS for energy-saving coproduction of highly valuable chemicals and green H 2 . Firstly, the fundamentals of HER, OER, OWS, and HWS are introduced, followed by a discussion on the electrochemical reconstruction of bifunctional electrocatalysts during OWS and HWS. Next, the HWS based on bifunctional electrocatalysts is summarized, wherein the alternative oxidation reactions include upgrading of alcohol, aldehydes, amines, biomass, and plastic waste. Finally, a brief overview of current challenges and perspective for bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8211;driven HWS is discussed.</description>

                Abstract Bimetallic nickel&#8208;iron based oxides are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we show that the precursor metal salts can affect the OER activity of the resulting Ni/Fe oxide under the same hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Pure sulfate, pure nitrate and mixed sulfate/nitrate metal salts were used to fabricate NiFe based oxide materials and to study the importance of the precursor choice for the OER. The results show that the nature of the precursor used in the synthesis of the bimetallic nickel&#8208;iron materials can influence different multi&#8208;phase catalysts to form which effects the OER.</description>

                Abstract We present the Python package , which provides a modular approach to the cluster expansion (CE) method. can treat a wide variety of substitutional systems, including one-, two-, and three-dimensional alloys, in a general multi-component and multi-sublattice framework. It is capable of dealing with complex materials comprising several atoms in their parent lattice . uses state-of-the-art techniques for the construction of training data sets, model selection, and finite-temperature simulations. The user interface consists of well-documented Python classes and modules ( http://sol.physik.hu-berlin.de/cell/ ). also provides visualization utilities and can be interfaced with virtually any ab initio package, total-energy codes based on interatomic potentials, and more. The usage and capabilities of are illustrated by a number of examples, comprising a Cu-Pt surface alloy with oxygen adsorption, featuring two coupled binary sublattices, and the thermodynamic analysis of its order-disorder transition; the demixing transition and lattice-constant bowing of the Si-Ge alloy; and an iterative CE approach for a complex clathrate compound with a parent lattice consisting of 54 atoms.</description>

      <title>Competing Kinetic Consequences of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the Oxidative Degradation of Branched Poly(ethylenimine)</title>

                Amine-functionalized porous solid materials are effective sorbents for direct air capture (DAC) of CO2. However, they are prone to oxidative degradation in service, increasing the materials cost for widespread implementation. While the identification of oxidation products has given insights into degradation pathways, the roles of some species, like CO2 itself, remain unresolved, with conflicting information in the literature. Here, we investigate the impact of CO2 on the oxidative degradation of poly(ethylenimine)&#8211;alumina (PEI/Al2O3) sorbents under conditions encompassing a wide range of CO2-air mixture compositions and temperatures relevant to DAC conditions, thereby reconciling the conflicting data in the literature. Degradation profiles characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, in situ ATR-FTIR, and CO2 capacity measurements reveal nonmonotonic effects of CO2 concentrations and temperatures on oxidation kinetics. Specifically, 0.04% CO2 accelerates PEI/Al2O3 oxidation more at low temperatures (&lt;90 &#176;C) compared to 1% and 5% CO2, but this trend reverses at high temperatures (&gt;90 &#176;C). First-principles metadynamics, machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, and 1H relaxometry experiments show that chemisorbed CO2 acid-catalyzes critical oxidation reactions, while extensive CO2 uptake reduces PEI branch mobility, slowing radical propagation. These contrasting kinetic effects of CO2 explain the complex degradation profiles observed in this work and in prior literature. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of considering atmospheric components in the design of DAC sorbents and processes. Additionally, it identifies the unconstrained branch mobility and local acid environment as two of the major culprits in the oxidation of amine-based sorbents, suggesting potential strategies to mitigate sorbent degradation.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Comparative Analysis of CO2 Absorption Columns in Electrochemical and Thermochemical Carbon Capture Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x7xkz-v2</link>

                Deployment of post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture technologies is needed to reduce emissions from power and industrial sources. Comparisons between existing thermochemical CO2 capture methods and emerging electrochemical concepts can help contextualize the promise of these new approaches. Here, we investigate the required absorber sizes for three capture systems: amine scrubbing using monoethanolamine (MEA), direct electrochemical (redox-active sorbent), and indirect electrochemical (pH-swing). For the electrochemical systems, we study how column size varies as a function of molecular properties and operating conditions, finding that parameters most closely related to CO2 uptake rates (i.e., rate constants and pKa) have the greatest impact. Through a Monte Carlo analysis, we find that the direct process can be designed to have column sizes similar to the thermochemical process, however, the CO2 uptake rate in the indirect process is too slow to enable smaller columns. Broadly, this work connects system input parameters to absorber performance for electrochemical CO2 capture and provides a foundation for technoeconomic and engineering analyses.</description>

      <title>Application of Predictive Control Strategies for Water-Gas Shift Membrane Reactors Using Data-Driven Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.12598</link>

                As demand for more efficient processes keeps rising and more restrictive environmental legislation requires higher levels of both yield and purity, the process industry has now, more than ever, been looking for new ways to achieve these goals. One approach has been the implementation of Process Intensification (PI). PI aims to combine multiple unit operations into a single one, promoting efficiency gains on multiple levels. This combination, however, leads to complex process dynamics, and controlling such processes, particularly when setup as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, presents a great challenge due to highly interactive complex process dynamics and the imposition of many operating constraints. The objectives of this research are to generate first-principles and data-driven water-gas shift membrane reactor (WGS-MR) models and to create predictive control schemes to perform effective setpoint tracking under a MIMO framework. The AVEVA Process Simulation platform is chosen for simulating the first-principles model and both Gaussian Processes using a Squared Exponential kernel (GP-SE) and Bayesian Smoothing Spline Analysis of Variance (BSS-ANOVA) are explored as possible frameworks for data-driven models. A Proportional&#8211;Integral&#8211; Derivative (PID) controller is created as a benchmark and a Quadratic Dynamic Matrix Controller (QDMC) is developed for advanced control of the system. The GP model is later used as a digital twin of the plant for calculating a control action trajectory that could be applied to the physical system in case of a desired setpoint change. The results demonstrate the superiority of the BSS-ANOVA model over the GP-SE, especially under open-loop simulation conditions. Also, both PID and QDMC perform well under the tested conditions, but the QDMC is able to deliver smoother control action, specially under noisy signals. Finally, when operating under closed-loop control, the BSS-ANOVA model is capable of providing a good representation of one of the variables being studied, namely carbon capture, with Integral of the Absolute Error (IAE) values ranging from 0.39 to 12.6, while creating a fit for the other variable, namely hydrogen recovery, with IAE measurements ranging from 3.71 to 26.7. These results indicate that the proposed framework is viable, although not universal, as each variable desired to be modeled and controlled should be tested and have its viability carefully assessed.</description>

      <title>Anion-Exchange Membrane Oxygen Separator</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsorginorgau.4c00052</link>
      <description>Maisa Faour, Karam Yassin, Dario R. Dekel, ACS Organic &amp; Inorganic Au. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401991440

                Anion-exchange membranes (AEMs), known for enabling the high conductivity of hydroxide anions through dense polymeric structures, are pivotal components in fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other important electrochemical systems. This paper unveils an unprecedented utilization of AEMs in an electrochemical oxygen separation process, a new technology able to generate enriched oxygen from an O2/N2 mixture using a small voltage input. We demonstrate a first-of-its-kind AEM-based electrochemical device that operates under mild conditions, is free of liquid electrolytes or sweep gases, and produces oxygen of over 96% purity. Additionally, we develop and apply a one-dimensional time-dependent and isothermal model, which accurately captures the unique operational dynamics of our device, demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data, and allows us to explore the device's potential capabilities. This novel technology has far-reaching applications in many industrial processes, medical oxygen therapy, and other diverse fields while reducing operational complexity and environmental impact, thereby paving the way for sustainable on-site oxygen generation.</description>
