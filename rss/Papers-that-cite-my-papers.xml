                Abstract The development of efficient and long&#8208;term stable electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in seawater is highly desirable for hydrogen generation but remains challenging. In this work, a highly active CrO x @Ni 2 P&#8208;Ni 5 P 4 /NF electrode is developed and investigated its dynamic reconstruction for HER in neutral electrolytes. The combination of in situ Raman spectra and electrochemical measurements revealed the dynamic surface reconstruction of the catalyst during HER. The CrO x modification not only effectively facilitates water dissociation but also stabilizes the structure post&#8208;reconstruction, enabling rapid and stable hydrogen generation in neutral media. Remarkably, CrO x @Ni 2 P&#8208;Ni 5 P 4 /NF exhibits overpotentials of 109 and 263 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m PBS, respectively. Concurrently, it exhibits stable operation for 500 h in 1 m PBS and 140 h in natural seawater at current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. The proposed catalytic electrode and the mechanistic insights present a significant stride toward the realization of metal phosphides for direct seawater splitting.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction on Cu-Based Monatomic Alloys: A DFT Study</title>

                In recent years, single-atom alloy catalysts (SAAs) have received much attention due to the combination of structural features of both single-atom and alloy catalysts, as well as their efficient catalytic activity, high selectivity, and high stability in various chemical reactions. In this work, we designed a series of Cu-based SAAs by doping isolated 3d transition metal (TM1) atoms on the surface of Cu(111) (TM1 = Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Os and Ir), in which Ir1/Cu(111) SAAs are considered to be the most stable among 3d-series SAAs due to their optimal binding energy (Eb). The density of states of SAAs have been systematically investigated to further discuss structural properties. Based on density functional theory calculations, the activity and selectivity of Ir1/Cu(111) SAAs are investigated for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The initial hydrogenation of CO2 on Ir1/Cu(111) SAAs can form *CO intermediates, which will be further to CH4 production by the pathway of *CO &#8594; *CHO &#8594; *CHOH &#8594; *CH2OH &#8594; *CH2 &#8594; *CH3 &#8594; CH4. This study provides theoretical insights for the rational design of selective Cu-based monatomic alloy catalysts.</description>

                We present a new general-purpose machine learning model that is able to predict a variety of crystal properties, including Fermi level energy and band gap, as well as spectral ones such as electronic densities of states. The model is based on atomic representations that enable it to effectively capture complex information about each atom and its surrounding environment in a crystal. The accuracy achieved for band gaps exceeds results previously published. By design, our model is not restricted to the electronic properties discussed here but can be extended to fit diverse chemical descriptors. Its advantages are (a) its low computational requirements, making it an efficient tool for high-throughput screening of materials; and (b) the simplicity and flexibility of its architecture, facilitating implementation and interpretation, especially for researchers in the field of computational chemistry.</description>

                Multifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are crucial for development of the key electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, for which single-atom catalyst (SAC) has present great promises.

                Abstract This paper provides a study for crystallographic orientation-dependent corrosion rate of aluminum employing an ab initio model with inputs from first-principles calculations. Results showed that the sequence of corrosion rate is in the order of (111) &lt; (410) &lt; (331) &lt; (221) &lt; (321) &lt; (211) &lt; (110) &lt; (100) &lt; (210) &lt; (320) &lt; (310) &lt; (311) for aluminum. The predicted corrosion current densities for (111), (110), and (100) surfaces are in general agreement with the experimental results. The alloying effects were further investigated employing this model with results validated via the polarization curves of alloyed aluminum.</description>

      <title>Score-based denoising for atomic structure identification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01337-z</link>

                Abstract We propose an effective method for removing thermal vibrations that complicate the task of analyzing complex dynamics in atomistic simulation of condensed matter. Our method iteratively subtracts thermal noises or perturbations in atomic positions using a denoising score function trained on synthetically noised but otherwise perfect crystal lattices. The resulting denoised structures clearly reveal underlying crystal order while retaining disorder associated with crystal defects. Purely geometric, agnostic to interatomic potentials, and trained without inputs from explicit simulations, our denoiser can be applied to simulation data generated from vastly different interatomic interactions. The denoiser is shown to improve existing classification methods, such as common neighbor analysis and polyhedral template matching, reaching perfect classification accuracy on a recent benchmark dataset of thermally perturbed structures up to the melting point. Demonstrated here in a wide variety of atomistic simulation contexts, the denoiser is general, robust, and readily extendable to delineate order from disorder in structurally and chemically complex materials.</description>

                Making a measurement over millions of nanoparticles or exposed crystal facets seldom reports on reactivity of a single nanoparticle or facet, which may depart drastically from ensemble measurements. Within the past 30 years, science has moved toward studying the reactivity of single atoms, molecules, and nanoparticles, one at a time. This shift has been fueled by the realization that everything changes at the nanoscale, especially important industrially relevant properties like those important to electrocatalysis. Studying single nanoscale entities, however, is not trivial and has required the development of new measurement tools. This review explores a tale of the clever use of old and new measurement tools to study electrocatalysis at the single entity level. We explore in detail the complex interrelationship between measurement method, electrocatalytic material, and reaction of interest (e.g., carbon dioxide reduction, oxygen reduction, hydrazine oxidation, etc.). We end with our perspective on the future of single entity electrocatalysis with a key focus on what types of measurements present the greatest opportunity for fundamental discovery.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the carbon nanomaterial&#8208;supported Pt complex electrocatalysts for efficient and selective chlorine evolution reaction</title>

                Chlorine is an important chemical which has long been produced in chlor-alkali process using dimensionally stable anodes (DSA). However, some serious drawbacks of DSA inspire the development of alternative anodes for chlorine evolution reaction (CER). In this study, we focused on the graphene- and carbon nanotube-supported platinum tetra-phenyl porphyrins as electrocatalysts for CER, which have been theoretically investigated based on density functional theory. Our results reveal that the supported substrates possess potential CER electrocatalytic activity with very low thermodynamic overpotentials (0.012-0.028 V) via Cl* pathway instead of ClO*. The electronic structures analyses showed that electron transfer from the support to the adsorbed chlorine via the Pt center leads to strong Pt-Cl interactions. Furthermore, the supported electrocatalysts exhibited excellent selectivity toward CER because of high overpotentials and reaction barriers of oxygen evolution process. Therefore, our results may pave the way for designing CER electrocatalyst utilizing emerging carbon nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering and Carbon Supporting to Achieve Ni-Doped CoP3 with High Catalytic Activities for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40820-024-01471-9</link>

                Abstract This work reports the use of defect engineering and carbon supporting to achieve metal-doped phosphides with high activities and stabilities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Specifically, the nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber-supported Ni-doped CoP 3 with rich P defects (Pv&#183;) on the carbon cloth (p-NiCoP/NCFs@CC) is synthesized through a plasma-assisted phosphorization method. The p-NiCoP/NCFs@CC is an efficient and stable catalyst for the HER and the OER. It only needs overpotentials of 107 and 306 mV to drive 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for the HER and the OER, respectively. Its catalytic activities are higher than those of other catalysts reported recently. The high activities of the p-NiCoP/NCFs@CC mainly arise from its peculiar structural features. The density functional theory calculation indicates that the Pv&#183; richness, the Ni doping, and the carbon supporting can optimize the adsorption of the H atoms at the catalyst surface and promote the strong electronic couplings between the carbon nanofiber-supported p-NiCoP with the surface oxide layer formed during the OER process. This gives the p-NiCoP/NCFs@CC with the high activities for the HER and the OER. When used in alkaline water electrolyzers, the p-NiCoP/NCFs@CC shows the superior activity and excellent stability for overall water splitting. Graphical abstract</description>

      <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Nanospheres with High Entropic Alloy Sites for Efficient Redox Electrocatalysis</title>

                Abstract High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are a versatile material with unique properties, tailored for various applications. They enable pH&#8208;sensitive electrocatalytic transformations like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR) in alkaline media. Mesoporous nanostructures with high surface area are preferred for these electrochemical reactions, but designing mesoporous HEA sis challenging. To overcome this challenge, a low&#8208;temperature triblock copolymer&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;chemical approach is developed to produce mesoporous HEA nanospheres composed of PtPdRuMoNi systems with sufficient entropic mixing. Owing to active sites with inherent entropic effect, mesoporous features, and increased accessibility, optimized HEA nanospheres promote strong HER/HOR performance in alkaline medium. At 30 mV nominal overpotential, it exhibits a mass activity of &#8776;167 (HER) and 151 A g Pt &#8722;1 (HOR), far exceeding commercial Pt&#8208;C electrocatalysts (34 and 48 A g Pt &#8722;1 ) and many recently reported various alloys. The Mott&#8208;Schottky analysis reveals HEA nanospheres inherit high charge carrier density, positive flat band potential, and smaller charge transfer barrier, resulting in better activity and faster kinetics. This micelle&#8208;assisted synthetic enable the exploration of the compositional and configurational spaces of HEAs at relatively low temperature, while simultaneously facilitating the introduction of mesoporous nanostructures for a wide range of catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Boosting electrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide coupled with organic oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50446-2</link>
      <description>Yining Sun, Kui Fan, Jinze Li, Li Wang, Yusen Yang, Zhenhua Li, Mingfei Shao, Xue Duan, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400809795

                Abstract The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is appealing due to its sustainability. However, its efficiency is compromised by the competing 4e &#8722; ORR pathway. In this work, we report a hierarchical carbon nanosheet array electrode with a single-atom Ni catalyst synthesized using organic molecule-intercalated layered double hydroxides as precursors. The electrode exhibits excellent 2e &#8722; ORR performance under alkaline conditions and achieves H 2 O 2 yield rates of 0.73 mol g cat &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 in the H-cell and 5.48 mol g cat &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 in the flow cell, outperforming most reported catalysts. The experimental results show that the Ni atoms selectively adsorb O 2 , while carbon nanosheets generate reactive hydrogen species, synergistically enhancing H 2 O 2 production. Furthermore, a coupling reaction system integrating the 2e &#8722; ORR with ethylene glycol oxidation significantly enhances H 2 O 2 yield rate to 7.30 mol g cat &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 while producing valuable glycolic acid. Moreover, we convert alkaline electrolyte containing H 2 O 2 directly into the downstream product sodium perborate to reduce the separation cost further. Techno-economic analysis validates the economic viability of this system.</description>

                Abstract The manipulation of crystal phases in metal&#8211;nonmetal interstitial alloy nanostructures has attracted considerable attention due to the formation of unique electronic structures and surface atomic arrangements, resulting in unprecedented catalytic performances. However, achieving simultaneous control over crystal phase and nonmetal elements in metal&#8211;nonmetal interstitial alloy nanostructures has remained a formidable challenge. Here, a novel synthesis approach is presented for Pd&#9472;B interstitial alloy nanocrystals (NCs) that allows investigation of the crystal&#8208;phase&#8208; and B&#8208;content&#8208;dependent catalytic performance. Through comparison of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) properties of Pd&#9472;B X interstitial alloy NCs with different crystal phases and B contents, achieved by precise control of reaction temperature and time, the influences of crystal phase and B contents in the Pd&#9472;B X interstitial alloy NCs on ORR are precisely investigated. The hexagonal closed packed (hcp) PdB 0.5 NCs exhibit superior catalytic activity, with mass activities reaching 2.58 A mg &#8722;1 , surpassing Pd/C by 10.3 times, attributed to synergistic effects by the hcp crystal phase and relatively high B contents. This study not only provides a novel approach to fabricate interstitial alloy nanostructures with unconventional crystal phases and finely controlled nonmetal elements but also elucidates the importance of crystal phase and nonmetal element content in optimizing electrocatalytic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Experimentally validating sabatier plot by molecular level microenvironment customization for oxygen electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50377-y</link>
      <description>Bingyu Huang, Qiao Gu, Xiannong Tang, Dirk L&#252;tzenkirchen&#8208;Hecht, Kai Yuan, Yiwang Chen, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400834814

                Microenvironmental modifications on metal sites are crucial to tune oxygen reduction catalytic behavior and decrypt intrinsic mechanism, whereas the stochastic properties of traditional pyrolyzed single-atom catalysts induce vague recognition on structure-reactivity relations. Herein, we report a theoretical descriptor relying on binding energies of oxygen adsorbates and directly associating the derived Sabatier volcano plot with calculated overpotential to forecast catalytic efficiency of cobalt porphyrin. This Sabatier volcano plot instructs that electron-withdrawing substituents mitigate the over-strong *OH intermediate adsorption by virtue of the decreased proportion of electrons in bonding orbital. To experimentally validate this speculation, we implement a secondary sphere microenvironment customization strategy on cobalt porphyrin-based polymer nanocomposite analogs. Systematic X-ray spectroscopic and in situ electrochemical characterizations capture the pronounced accessible active site density and the fast interfacial/outward charge migration kinetics contributions for the optimal carboxyl group-substituted catalyst. This work offers ample strategies for designing single-atom catalysts with well-managed microenvironment under the guidance of Sabatier volcano map.</description>

      <title>Utilizing cost-effective pyrocarbon for highly efficient gold retrieval from e-waste leachate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50595-4</link>
      <description>Kaixing Fu, Xia Liu, Xiaolin Zhang, Shenghui Zhou, Nanwen Zhu, Yong Pei, Jinming Luo, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400847545

                Abstract Addressing burdens of electronic waste (E-waste) leachate while achieving sustainable and selective recovery of noble metals, such as gold, is highly demanded due to its limited supply and escalating prices. Here we demonstrate an environmentally-benign and practical approach for gold recovery from E-waste leachate using alginate-derived pyrocarbon sorbent. The sorbent demonstrates potent gold recovery performance compared to most previously reported advanced sorbents, showcasing high recovery capacity of 2829.7 mg g &#8722;1 , high efficiency (&gt;99.5%), remarkable selectivity ( K d ~ 3.1 &#215; 10 8 mL g &#8722;1 ), and robust anti-interference capabilities within environmentally relevant contexts. The aromatic structures of pyrocarbon serve as crucial electrons sources, enabling a hydroxylation process that simultaneously generates electrons and phenolic hydroxyls for the reduction of gold ions. Our investigations further uncover a &#8220;stepwise&#8221; nucleation mechanism, in which gold ions are reduced as intermediate gold-chlorine clusters, facilitating rapid reduction process by lowering energy barriers from 1.08 to &#8722;21.84 eV. Technoeconomic analysis demonstrates its economic viability with an input-output ratio as high as 1370%. Our protocol obviates the necessity for organic reagents whilst obtaining 23.96 karats gold product from real-world central processing units (CPUs) leachates. This work introduces a green sorption technique for gold recovery, emphasizing its role in promoting a circular economy and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Modelling chemical processes in explicit solvents with machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-50418-6</link>

                Abstract Solvent effects influence all stages of the chemical processes, modulating the stability of intermediates and transition states, as well as altering reaction rates and product ratios. However, accurately modelling these effects remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy for generating reactive machine learning potentials to model chemical processes in solution. Our approach combines active learning with descriptor-based selectors and automation, enabling the construction of data-efficient training sets that span the relevant chemical and conformational space. We apply this strategy to investigate a Diels-Alder reaction in water and methanol. The generated machine learning potentials enable us to obtain reaction rates that are in agreement with experimental data and analyse the influence of these solvents on the reaction mechanism. Our strategy offers an efficient approach to the routine modelling of chemical reactions in solution, opening up avenues for studying complex chemical processes in an efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Photophysics and Photocatalytic Activity of Heteroleptic Rh(III) Transition-Metal Complexes Using High-Throughput Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c02420</link>

                High-throughput synthesis and screening (HTSS) methods were used to investigate the photophysical properties of 576 heteroleptic Rh(III) transition-metal complexes through measurement of the UV-visible absorption spectra, deaerated excited-state lifetime, and phosphorescent emission spectra. While 4d transition-metal photophysics are often highly influenced by deleterious metal-centered deactivation channels, the HTSS of structurally diverse cyclometalating and ancillary ligands attached to the metal center facilitated the discovery of photoactive complexes exhibiting long-lived charge-transfer phosphorescence (0.15-0.95 &#956;s) spanning a substantial portion of the visible region (546-620 nm) at room temperature. Further photophysical and electrochemical investigations were then carried out on select complexes with favorable photophysics to understand the underlying features controlling these superior properties. Heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes with identical ligand morphology were also synthesized to compare these features to this family of well understood chromophores. A number of these Rh(III) complexes contained the requisite properties for photocatalytic activity and were consequently tested as photocatalysts (PCs) in a water reduction system using a Pd water reduction cocatalyst. Under certain conditions, the activity of the Rh(III) PC actually surpassed that of the Ir(III) PC, uncovering the potential of this often-overlooked class of transition metals as both efficient photoactive chromophores and PCs.</description>
