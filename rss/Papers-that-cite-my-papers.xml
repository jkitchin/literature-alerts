                Abstract Ammonia is a crucial component in the production of fertilizers and various nitrogen-based compounds. Now, the lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) has emerged as a promising approach for ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. The proton shuttle plays a critical role in the proton transfer process during Li-NRR. However, the structure-activity relationship and design principles for effective proton shuttles have not yet been established in practical Li-NRR systems. Here, we propose a general procedure for verifying a true proton shuttle and established design principles for effective proton shuttles. We systematically evaluate several classes of proton shuttles in a continuous-flow reactor with hydrogen oxidation at the anode. Among the tested proton shuttles, phenol exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency of 72 &#177; 3% towards ammonia, surpassing that of ethanol, which has been commonly used so far. Experimental investigations including operando isotope-labelled mass spectrometry proved the proton-shuttling capability of phenol. Further mass transport modeling sheds light on the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Atomic-level charge separation boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>

                The synergistic implementation of atomic-level charge separation strategies for bulk&#8211;surfaces is a meaningful study that fundamentally addresses the shortcomings of single materials. Here, we report for the first time the atomic-level engineering of atomic doping in combination with surface ion grafting, which can be coordinated to significantly facilitate photocatalytic H2 evolution. More impressively, the study systematically investigated the atomic doping effects of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu atoms, and analyzed the conditions for optimal doping with experimental and theoretical calculations. Electrons from the Cu were transferred to Zn0.67Cd0.33S or adsorbed H atoms on its surface, effectively enhancing the surface charge density and electron transport capacity. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results verified the precise coordination environments of the doped Cu atoms, as well as confirmed the solid grafting of Ni ions on the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the hydrogen production rate of 1.2 % Cu&#8211;Zn0.67Cd0.33S&#8211;0.5 wt% Ni reached 38.17 mmol/g/h, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 35.5 %, which is 82.8 times higher than that of pure ZCS. Besides, the H2 production rate can reached 118.73 mmol/g/h without cooling. Meanwhile, the synergistic strategy of manipulating the bulk and surface photo-charges of Zn0.67Cd0.33S also effectively enhances the photothermal effect and further improves its photocatalytic performance. This work provides different inspirations for bottom-up design of efficient photocatalysts to achieve synergistic facilitation strategies.</description>

      <title>Emergent high-temperature insulating ferromagnetism in Sr4Fe5CoO13-&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt; epitaxial thin films</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0190376</link>
      <description>Xinhai Han, Jianlin Wang, Nanqi Gong, Zheling Shan, Wei Shi, Z. Liu, Xuguang Liu, Jiefeng Cao, Ranran Peng, Qiuping Huang, Zhengping Fu, Yalin Lu, Applied Physics Letters. 124(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392915039

                High-temperature ferromagnetic insulators play a crucial role in a wide range of emerging magnetoelectricity phenomena and hold the potential to become fundamental components of upcoming spintronic devices. However, the strong interaction between ferromagnetism and metallic properties presents a challenge, impeding the development of high-temperature ferromagnetic insulators based on oxides. Heterostructures or superlattice materials, especially those containing perovskite layers, offer a forward-looking solution. In this work, high-quality Sr4Fe6O13 (SFO) and cobalt-doped SFO (Sr4Fe5CoO13-&#948;, SFCO) thin films were grown on Nb-SrTiO3(001) substrates using pulsed laser deposition technology. The grown SFO films exhibit paramagnetism, possibly due to the transition of their film structure from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase. In contrast to SFO films, high-quality SFCO thin films exhibit significant ferromagnetism at room temperature, with Curie transition temperature as high as 800 K. This phenomenon is mainly attributed to the formed Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions between Fe&#8211;O&#8211;Co and increased lattice distortions caused by Co-doping. In contrast, the Curie transition temperature of the SFCO film is slightly higher than that of the SFCO ceramics. This enhancement is likely due to surface effects, where an increase in surface energy introduces additional energy barriers at the film surface and interface, thereby enhancing the thermal stability of the film. These characteristics advance the research of high-temperature magnetic insulators and broaden the operating temperature range of spintronic devices based on ferromagnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Recent Design Strategies for M&#8208;N&#8208;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Oxygen Reduction: An Entropy Increase Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202401027</link>
      <description>Wei Yan, Wenmiao Chen, Yanli Chen, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392918007

                Abstract Recently, a diverse array of novel metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have rapidly evolve, particularly in the realm of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Despite the plethora of proposed design and improvement strategies for SACs, a comprehensive review systematically compiling the components in M&#8208;N&#8208;C from a unified perspective is notably absent. For the first time, a thorough examination of each component in M&#8208;N&#8208;C is conducted, focusing on the perspective of entropy increase in the active sites of SACs. For the single M&#8208;N 4 sites and the whole M&#8208;N&#8208;C system, an increase in entropy implies an elevated degree of disorder and chaos. Broadly, the entropy&#8208;increasing modification of M (single mental sites) and guest groups entails an augmentation of chaos, with the most effective co&#8208;catalytic synergy achieved by establishing multiple active sites through a &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;. Concerning N (nitrogen and other heteroatoms) and C (carbon supports), the entropy increase modification induces heightened disorder, with symmetry breaking more likely to drive M&#8208;N 4 toward adsorbing oxygen molecules to attain an equilibrium symmetric structure. All these innovative design strategies have led to a remarkable improvement in the ORR activity and stability and offer a guiding criterion for the future preparation of SACs.</description>

      <title>Redox Engineering of Fe&#8208;Rich Disordered Rock&#8208;Salt Li&#8208;Ion Cathode Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.202400402</link>
      <description>Richie Fong, Nauman Mubarak, Sang&#8208;Wook Park, Gregory Lazaris, Yiwei Liu, Rahul Malik, Dong&#8208;Hwa Seo, Jinhyuk Lee, Advanced Energy Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392918991

                Abstract The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective Li&#8208;ion batteries emphasizes the need for cathode materials composed of abundant elements, such as Fe. Disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathode materials, known for their high compositional flexibility, offer a unique opportunity in this regard. However, Fe&#8208;rich DRX (Fe&#8208;DRX) cathodes, potentially the most cost&#8208;effective among all DRXs, have seen limited research interest due to their comparatively restrained performance. This limitation stems from the inaccessibility of the Fe 3+ /Fe 4+ redox in the DRX structure, prompting the need for redox engineering to enable Fe&#8208;DRXs with readily utilizable redox mechanisms. In this work, utilizing both experiments and theoretical study, reversible Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox in an Fe 2+ &#8208;based DRX cathode is demonstrated. This design minimizes the reliance on O redox, resulting in a high capacity (&#8776;290 mAh g &#8722;1 ) and energy density (&#8776;700 Wh kg &#8722;1 ), as opposed to an Fe 3+ &#8208;based DRX operating on the limited Fe 3+ /Fe 4+ redox and extensive O redox upon cycling. Overall, the study introduces a novel approach to redox engineering to develop low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performing Fe&#8208;rich cathode materials.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Activity Prediction of &#945;-Diimino Nickel Precatalysts toward Ethylene Polymerization by Machine Learning</title>

                The present study explored machine learning methods to predict the catalytic activities of a dataset of 165 &#945;-diimino nickel complexes in ethylene polymerization. Using 25 descriptors as the inputs, the XGBoost model presented the optimal performance among six different algorithms (R2 = 0.999, Rt2 = 0.921, Q2 = 0.561). The results of the analysis indicate that high activity is related to the presence of polarizable atoms and less bulky substituents within the N-aryl group. This approach offers valuable insights on the variation principle of catalytic activity as a function of complex structure, helping to effectively design and optimize &#945;-diimino Ni catalysts with desirable performance.</description>

      <title>Influence of Alkali Metal Cations on the Oxygen Reduction Activity of Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Y and Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Gd Alloys</title>

                Electrolyte species can significantly influence the electrocatalytic performance. In this work, we investigate the impact of alkali metal cations on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on active Pt5Gd and Pt5Y polycrystalline electrodes. Due to the strain effects, Pt alloys exhibit a higher kinetic current density of ORR than pure Pt electrodes in acidic media. In alkaline solutions, the kinetic current density of ORR for Pt alloys decreases linearly with the decreasing hydration energy in the order of Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+ &gt; Rb+ &gt; Cs+, whereas Pt shows the opposite trend. To gain further insights into these experimental results, we conduct complementary density functional theory calculations considering the effects of both electrode surface strain and electrolyte chemistry. The computational results reveal that the different trends in the ORR activity in alkaline media can be explained by the change in the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates with applied surface strain in the presence of alkali metal cations. Our findings provide important insights into the effects of the electrolyte and the strain conditions on the electrocatalytic performance and thus offer valuable guidelines for optimizing Pt-based electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract This paper evaluates the technological trends in the carbon sequestration process. For this purpose, these systems have been classified into two subsystems: conventional technologies subsystem and emerging technologies subsystem. Each is explored for its suitability for meeting a set of six attributes. A bibliometric analysis process was developed using the Scopus database and VOSviewer Software to present the potential of each subsystem evaluated, through an evaluation matrix. The analysis of the subsystems and attributes was performed through the formal concept analysis methodology (8FCA). To facilitate the processing of the information, the open access software concept Explorer was used. The analysis shows that conventional technologies, despite their cost, will be maintained and advance in their implementation process. The bibliometric analysis integrated with the applied FCA methodology has proven to be useful for the evaluation of technological typologies and serves as an alternative to develop theoretical studies that group and link different options as a model to evaluate a deterministic set of attributes.</description>

                We use computations and experiments to determine the effect of substituting zirconium, niobium, and tantalum within rutile RuO2 on the structure, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism and activity, and electrochemical stability. Calculated electronic structures altered by Zr, Nb, and Ta show surface regions of electron density depletion and accumulation, along with anisotropic lattice parameter shifts dependent on the substitution site, substituent, and concentration. Consistent with theory, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments show shifts in binding energies of O-2s, O-2p, and Ru-4d peaks due to the substituents. Experimentally, the substituted materials showed the presence of two phases with a majority phase that contains the metal substituent within the rutile phase and a second, smaller-percentage RuO2 phase. Our experimental analysis of OER activity shows Zr, Nb, and Ta substituents at 12.5 atom % induce lower activity relative to RuO2, which agrees with computing the average of all sites; however, Zr and Ta substitution at specific sites yields higher theoretical OER activity than RuO2, with Zr substitution suggesting an alternative OER mechanism. Metal dissolution predictions show the involvement of cooperative interactions among multiple surface sites and the electrolyte. Zr substitution at specific sites increases activation barriers for Ru dissolution, however, with Zr surface dissolution rates comparable to those of Ru. Experimental OER stability analysis shows lower Ru dissolution from synthesized RuO2 and Zr-substituted RuO2 compared to commercial RuO2 and comparable amounts of Zr and Ru dissolved from Zr-substituted RuO2, aligned with our calculations.</description>

                In the experimental preparation of monolayer GaN (0 0 1) by chemical-vapor deposition, H impurities inevitably remain, and the intrinsic defect VGa inevitably forms. In this research, generalized gradient approximation + U plane-wave ultrasoft pseudopotentials are computed using the density-functional theory framework. The effects of Li/Na/K doping and point defect (Hi-VGa) coexistence on the magnetic properties and photocatalytic properties of monolayer GaN (0 0 1) surfaces are investigated. Results show that the monolayer Ga34MN36 (M = Li/Na/K) (0 0 1) surfaces are magnetic, and the source of its magnetism is primarily the itinerant electrons of N2&#8722; ions. The monolayer Ga34MHiN36 (0 0 1) surfaces are relatively more stable, and the separation degree of carriers is better than the monolayer Ga34MN36 (0 0 1) surfaces. In particular, the monolayer Ga34LiHiN36 (0 0 1) surface has a large electric-dipole moment, strong carrier activity, strong absorption efficiency, and strong oxidation-reduction properties. Therefore, the monolayer Ga34LiHiN36 (0 0 1) surface is the most suitable photocatalyst.</description>

                Dual-atom catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction have received widespread attention, but precise screening and prediction of high-performance catalysts through simple methods remains a challenge. In this study, we perform high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculation and machine learning (ML) to screen and predict the transition metal dual-atom catalysts with N-doped graphene support (TMDACs) for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction. The Fe_Zn and V_Fe DACs were proposed to be the most promising candidates for Pt-based catalyst toward acidic HER from 406 TMDACs, based on the characteristics of HER activity, formation, thermodynamic stability, abundance, environmental friendliness. The Fe_Zn and V_Fe DACs with excellent HER performance is due to the synergistic effect deriving from the interaction between H and dual metal atoms in TMDACs. By determining 6 different ML models with four kind of input features, we find the artificial neural networks (ANN) model can predict the HER performance of TMDACs most accurately only using simple input features, including one-hot-encoding of atomic number and Gibbs free energy of transition metal single-atom catalyst. This work not only proposed the potential TMDACs with high HER performance, but also verified that the ANN model can accurately predict the HER activity of diatomic catalysts with simple input features.</description>

      <title>Ru/Ir&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Conditions: From Mechanisms, Optimizations to Challenges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202309364</link>

                Abstract The generation of green hydrogen by water splitting is identified as a key strategic energy technology, and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one of the desirable technologies for converting renewable energy sources into hydrogen. However, the harsh anode environment of PEMWE and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involving four&#8208;electron transfer result in a large overpotential, which limits the overall efficiency of hydrogen production, and thus efficient electrocatalysts are needed to overcome the high overpotential and slow kinetic process. In recent years, noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts (e.g., Ru/Ir&#8208;based metal/oxide electrocatalysts) have received much attention due to their unique catalytic properties, and have already become the dominant electrocatalysts for the acidic OER process and are applied in commercial PEMWE devices. However, these noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts still face the thorny problem of conflicting performance and cost. In this review, first, noble metal Ru/Ir&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts are briefly classified according to their forms of existence, and the OER catalytic mechanisms are outlined. Then, the focus is on summarizing the improvement strategies of Ru/Ir&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts with respect to their activity and stability over recent years. Finally, the challenges and development prospects of noble metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of CuPd Icosahedra Supercrystals Studied by In Situ X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202311714</link>

                Abstract Nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into supercrystals provides a versatile platform for creating novel materials and devices with tailored properties. While common self&#8208;assembly strategies imply the use of purified nanoparticles after synthesis, conversion of chemical precursors directly into nanocrystals and then supercrystals in simple procedures has been rarely reported. Here, the nucleation and growth of CuPd icosahedra and their consecutive assembly into large closed&#8208;packed face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) supercrystals are studied. To this end, the study simultaneously and in situ measures X&#8208;ray total scattering with pair distribution function analysis (TS&#8208;PDF) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). It is found that the supercrystals' formation is preceded by an intermediate dense phase of nanocrystals displaying short&#8208;range order (SRO). It is further shown that the organization of oleic acid/oleylamine surfactants into lamellar structures likely drives the emergence of the SRO phase and later of the supercrystals by reducing the volume accessible to particle diffusion. The supercrystals' formation as well as their disassembly are triggered by temperature. The study demonstrates that ordering of solvent molecules can be crucial in the direct synthesis of supercrystals. The study also provides a general approach to investigate novel preparation routes of supercrystals in situ and across several length scales via X&#8208;ray scattering.</description>

                Abstract Algal biomass is a promising feedstock for the environmentally friendly production of a diverse range of high-value products, including bioproducts and biofuels. After extracting the essential macro- and biomolecules, the remaining algae biomass can be used as feedstock and processed into valuable additional goods. Advanced biotechnology techniques and efficient hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technologies are used to produce beneficial products such as bioenergy and biochemicals. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are essential biochemical components of algal biomass that can be used to produce biofuel. Hence, algae biomass is gaining popularity as a biorefinery alternative. HTL is a process of converting biomass to a liquid byproduct by intricate chemical reactions. The purpose of this review is to highlight modern biotechnological and hydrothermal liquefaction techniques for extracting biological products from algae. A large number of documents were reviewed and analytically structured to lay the groundwork for the subsequent steps. This review also included information on a simple reaction mechanism for the biomass that algae produce, as well as the impact of process parameters.</description>

                Abstract Profiting from the unique atomic laminated structure, metallic conductivity, and superior mechanical properties, transition metal carbides and nitrides named MAX phases have shown great potential as anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the complexity of MAX configurations poses a challenge. To accelerate such application, a minus integrated crystal orbital Hamilton populations descriptor is innovatively proposed to rapidly evaluate the lithium storage potential of various MAX, along with density functional theory computations. It confirms that surface A&#8208;element atoms bound to lithium ions have odds of escaping from MAX. Interestingly, the activated A&#8208;element atoms enhance the reversible uptake of lithium ions by MAX anodes through an efficient alloying reaction. As an experimental verification, the charge compensation and Sn x Li y phase evolution of designed Zr 2 SnC MAX with optimized structure is visualized via in situ synchrotron radiation XRD and XAFS technique, which further clarifies the theoretically expected intercalation/alloying hybrid storage mechanism. Notably, Zr 2 SnC electrodes achieve remarkably 219.8% negative capacity attenuation over 3200 cycles at 1 A g &#8722;1 . In principle, this work provides a reference for the design and development of advanced MAX electrodes, which is essential to explore diversified applications of the MAX family in specific energy fields.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Advancing Sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion Processes: Trinomial Technology, Environment, and Economy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07133</link>
      <description>Lourdes F. Vega, Daniel Baham&#243;n, Ismail I.I. Alkhatib, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4393097423

                CO2 can be converted into value-added products such as fuels, chemicals, and building materials, adding an economic incentive for CO2 capture and green economy, while also reducing the environmental footprint of hard-to-abate industries such as aviation, construction, and metallurgy. Nonetheless, most available technologies for direct CO2 conversion, while promising, are still in early development stages, facing technical and economic challenges for their scale-up, questioning their viability to truly instill a timely impact on global CO2 emissions. Furthermore, a clear environmental benefit should be obtained for the new processes versus the traditional ones they are replacing in the market. In this perspective, we examine the range of available technologies for direct CO2 conversion using thermal, electrical, and photochemical routes and mineralization including the advancements in their role in synthesizing a range of resulting products from methanol, methane, carbon monoxide, and solid carbonates. We offer insights on the trends in current research and development and the required direction to expedite the technological readiness of attractive CO2 conversion technologies in terms of catalytic material and reactor design. We also highlight the important role of modeling (molecular and process levels) as an enabling tool to deploy these technologies at the commercial scale originating from understanding their behavior at the molecular level. Lastly, we highlight the significance of carrying out reliable life cycle analysis in identifying the environmental hotspots as well as gaps in the technology that allows improving their environmental footprint and economic attractiveness.</description>
