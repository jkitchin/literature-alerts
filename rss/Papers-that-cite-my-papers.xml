                Rational design and development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with high activity, high stability, and high toxicity resistance is the key to promoting the commercialization and large-scale application of fuel cells. The main purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest strategies and developments in metal-based materials for ORR from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, especially the Pt-based catalysts with excellent ORR activity are summarized, including structural design, surface modification, size regulation, electron configurations modulation, and lattice facets modulation. In addition, the synthesis strategy, relationship between structure and performance, and catalytic mechanism of the latest Pt-based metal catalyst for ORR are systematically discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of metal-based catalysts in electrocatalytic ORR are proposed.</description>

                Electrocatalysis holds paramount significance in driving the progress of sustainable energy technologies, such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and batteries. The presence of various species on the electrode surface, such as reactants, intermediates, and products during electrocatalysis' usually gives rise to complex reaction pathways. A systematic understanding of various electrocatalytic processes in chemical reactions is required to untangle the complicated interaction of species on the catalyst's surface and their influence on the electrocatalytic process. Taking hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as examples, this chapter introduces electrocatalytic mechanisms, feasible reaction pathways, and fundamental concepts to readers and stimulates their interest in the various fields of electrocatalysts and their applications.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory for Electrocatalytic Energy Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/9783527846368.ch2</link>
      <description>Wei Li, Yi Ding, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405358277

                Electrocatalytic technology plays an important role in advancing green and sustainable energy. Various significant electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), have huge potential in green energy conversion. However, the conversion efficiency is limited by slow kinetic processes and high reaction overpotentials. Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and selectivity is of paramount importance. Based on density functional theory (DFT), theoretical calculations can not only analyze the electrocatalytic reaction processes from the perspective of molecular structure and energy but also provide an in-depth understanding of the electronic structures of the catalysts and establish the structure&#8211;activity relationships between catalysts and electrocatalytic reactions. Thus, DFT calculations can offer theoretical basis and guidance for the design and preparation of efficient electrocatalysts. In this chapter, we will introduce some DFT calculation methods and several electrocatalytic reactions, aiming to help readers understand how DFT calculations are applied to electrocatalytic energy conversion.</description>

                ABSTRACT Using first principles calculations we investigate cobalt&#8208;coordinated tetracyanoquinodimethane (R&#8208;CoTCNQ) as a potential catalyst for the CO 2 electroreduction reaction (CO 2 ERR). We determine that exchange&#8211;correlation functionals beyond the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are required to accurately describe the spin properties of R&#8208;CoTCNQ, therefore, the meta&#8208;GGA r 2 SCAN functional is used in this study. The free energy CO 2 ERR reaction pathways are calculated for the reduced catalyst ([R&#8208;CoTCNQ] &#8722;1 e ) with reaction products HCOOH and HCHO predicted depending on our choice of electrode potential. Calculations are also performed for [R&#8208;CoTCNQ] &#8722;1 e supported on a H&#8208;terminated diamond (1 1 0) surface with reaction pathways being qualitatively similar to the [R&#8208;CoTCNQ] &#8722;1 e monolayer. The inclusion of boron&#8208;doping in the diamond support shows a slightly improved CO 2 ERR reaction pathway. Furthermore, structurally, supported R&#8208;CoTCNQ provide a high specific area of active Co active sites and could be promising catalysts for future experimental consideration.</description>

                Writing scientific literature reviews is highly challenging, especially for broad topics like "heterogeneous catalysis" due to the explosion of knowledge. In this article, we introduce a machine-assisted approach aimed to facilitating this process. It integrates an automated summarization of several sources into the conventional method of writing a literature review. Our approach represents an initial trial to compile recent trends in heterogeneous catalysis. We chose the topic of heterogeneous catalysis due to its significance in various industrial processes and its multidisciplinary nature, which makes reviewing it challenging. The review highlights the pursuit of more advanced and complex catalysts to enhance catalytic performance. These advances significantly influence chemical reaction engineering, which combines reaction chemistry and chemical engineering. The trend of developing complex catalysts faces feasibility challenges, underscoring the importance of balancing practicality and potential benefits. In this interplay, the role of atomistic understanding becomes more important as it provides insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing catalyst behavior. Therefore, this review also covers advances in computational studies, particularly density functional theory calculations and the incorporation of new techniques. The wide scope of knowledge presented in this initial trial will facilitate further development in the field of chemical reaction engineering.</description>

                Abstract Nanoporous and chemically&#8208;bridged graphene nanosheets span a wide chemical space with a broad set of applications in sensing and electronics. Modeling the structure and dynamics of such nanosheets is challenging, as chemical bond making and breaking as well as non&#8208;covalent interactions must be captured accurately and on equal footing. Here it is showed that recent graph&#8208;based machine&#8208;learned force field (MLFF) SO3krates [J. T. Frank et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 6539 (2024)] is able to reliably model the dynamics and mechanical response for a broad class of nanoporous graphenes when trained on accurate density functional theory data that includes long&#8208;range many&#8208;body dispersion (MBD) interactions. In contrast, local moment tensor potentials and empirical reactive potentials are much less accurate. It is also found that recent MLFFs trained on solid&#8208;state datasets must be used with care, since even empirical potentials occasionally yield more accurate results. These findings highlight the potential of properly&#8208;trained graph MLFFs in modeling the properties of whole chemical spaces of complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enabled Thermochemistry Estimator</title>

                Modeling adsorbates on single-crystal metals is critical in rational catalyst design and other research that requires detailed thermochemistry. First-principles simulations via density functional theory (DFT) are among the prevalent tools to acquire such information about surface species. While they are highly dependable, DFT calculations often require intensive computational resources and runtime. These limiting factors become particularly pronounced when investigating large sets of complex molecules on heavy noble metals. Consequently, our ability to explore these species and their corresponding energetics is limited. In this work, we establish a novel framework that utilizes techniques including molecular encoding, descriptor synthesis, and machine learning to overcome the limitation of costly DFT simulations. Simultaneously, we estimate thermochemical information efficiently at the DFT accuracy level. More specifically, we translated our training molecules into text-based identifiers through a simplified molecular-input line-entry system. Following that, we parametrize our training matrices with sets of short-range descriptors based on group methods, applying first the nearest neighbors to account for linear contributions. This is coupled with the long-range descriptors characterizing second nearest neighbors to account for nonlinear corrections. Finally, we use linear regression and machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regressions to regress over the linear and nonlinear matrix systems, respectively. This is the first work to our knowledge that encompasses both the first and second nearest neighbors based on the group theory throughout the featurization, training, and deployment stages. We trained and validated our models with 459 surface species on Pt(111), Ru(0001), and Ir(111) surfaces. Results exhibit robust performance to reproduce the energetics of interest, such as enthalpies, entropies, and heat capacities, at various temperatures. Notably, the mean absolute errors can be reduced by 48% during training and 19% during prediction at a minimum, when compared to the classical group method. Leveraging the novel framework, our machine-learning-enabled thermochemistry estimator significantly empowers us to research the thermochemistry of complex species on metal catalysts.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Electrochemical Oxidation and Reduction of Nickel Oxide Surfaces</title>

                Surface oxidation/reduction processes, driven by varying electrochemical potentials, can substantially impact catalyst effectiveness and, consequently, electrolyzer performance. This study combines theoretical and experimental approaches to explore the surface redox behavior of nickel oxides, which are cost-effective and efficient catalysts for many electrochemical reactions. Surface Pourbaix diagrams for three different phases of nickel oxides, i.e., nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2), nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), and nickel dioxide (NiO2), were constructed using density functional theory-based simulations. Various experimental methods, including cyclic voltammetry, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical titration, were employed to probe the surface redox processes of nickel oxide thin films. Our findings indicate that the ABAB stacking sequence of Ni(OH)2 lacks stability under oxidizing conditions to host the surface oxidation (deprotonation) events, while the AABBCC stacking sequence of NiOOH is energetically favorable due to the presence of interlayer hydrogen bonding. Rapid charge transfer facilitated by interlayer hydrogen bonding accounts for the higher reactivity of partially oxidized/reduced NiOOH (001) surfaces compared to Ni(OH)2 (001) and NiO2 (001) surfaces with the same stoichiometry, where interlayer hydrogen bonding is absent. Insights presented in this work can offer guidelines for optimizing operational conditions and tailoring the surface structures and oxidation states of nickel oxides to enhance performance in applications such as electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.</description>

                CNx catalysts show promising activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under acidic conditions, but the nature of the active site is still under debate. ORR on CNx has been found to be resistant to common poisons such as CO, H2S, and CN. In this study, we demonstrate that bubbling CO2 in the electrolyte can lead to the partial poisoning of CNx for ORR activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments show a partial decrease in the ORR activity for CNx catalysts after bubbling CO2 through a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The relative stability of CO2-derived species (CO2*, H2CO3*, HCO3*, and CO3*) on 13 CNx site models at 1.0 V-RHE was examined using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations predict that HCO3 is favored adjacent to the N species on several CNx site models and CO3 is favored on pyrrolic sites. Difference spectra of the N 1s from near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) of the ex-situ poisoned CNx and pristine CNx shows a shift in binding energies of N species that qualitatively match the DFT N 1s binding energy shifts due to HCO3/CO3 on the CNx site models. DFT predicts that these HCO3 surface species can block and delay the initial step of the ORR on several CNx sites.</description>

                Abstract Effective first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts are crucial for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy generation and anion exchange membrane (AEM) devices in water splitting. The present work describes that SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH nanosheets on nickel foam are used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and AEM water electrolyzer study. Tuning the Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios in NiFe&#8208;LDH and doping with Sm ions improves the electrical structure and intrinsic activity. SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH has higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER), HER, and TWS activity, achieving 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 current density at lower overpotentials (230 mV, 95 mV, and 1.62 V, respectively). In AEMWE cells, SmNi 0.02 Fe&#8208;LDH as a cathode and anode pair exhibits outstanding activity (0.9 A cm&#8315; 2 at 2 V) and stability over 120 h. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations reveal that the Sm doping in NiFe&#8208;LDH surface enhances its bifunctional activity toward OER and HER. These findings emphasize the potential of non&#8208;noble composites for long&#8208;term water electrolysis in total water splitting and AEMWE applications.</description>

                Abstract The modular assembly of organic molecules commonly guides the design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), yet the systematic exploration of inorganic building blocks remains limited. Given the promising applications in catalytic reactions and topological materials, the study of metal&#8211;inorganic frameworks (MIFs)&#8212;which fundamentally differ from the well&#8208;established MOFs&#8212;has become urgent. This study introduces a strategy for designing MIFs using host atom&#8208;centered building blocks, applied to the platinum&#8211;Phosphorus (Pt&#8211;P) system. By combining experimental observations with theoretical calculations, a Pt 18 P 18 framework utilizing PtP 3 building blocks, demonstrating significant energetic benefits is proposed. PtP 3 units are employed to characterize Pt 3 P 6 clusters within the pores, leading to a &#8220;compass&#8221; model that aligns with experimental findings. To address computational challenges associated with the large periodicity of the superstructure, a robust machine learning force field is developed. The analysis, combining surface nucleation studies, first&#8208;principles calculations, and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive understanding of MIF structure. This validated Pt&#8211;P MIF exhibits exceptional catalytic properties with diverse reaction sites, significantly outperforming Pt(111) in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The findings not only present additional candidates for practical applications of metal phosphides but also highlight the vast potential of MIFs, paving the way for the discovery of numerous promising materials.</description>

                Abstract Perovskite oxides have been considered promising oxygen catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), owing to structural and compositional flexibility, and tailorable properties. Ingenious B&#8208;site ordered La 1.5 Sr 0.5 NiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 O 6 (LSNMF) double perovskite is strategically designed by simultaneously interposing Ni 0.5 Mn 0.5 and Ni 0.5 Fe 0.5 into B&#8242; and B&#8243; sites. Controlling B&#8208;site cation systematically tailors the electronic structure of the B&#8208;site cation with a d&#8208;band center (M d ) upshift close to the Fermi level, increasing the overlap of the M d center and O 2p center (O P ). The strong interaction of M d and O p facilitates the adsorption of oxygen and activates the lattice oxygen to participate in the OER process, thereby enhancing the ORR and OER activity. For ORR, LSNMF exhibited an onset potential of 0.9 V along with a high limiting current of &#8722;8.05 mA cm &#8722;2 . At the same time, for OER at 1 m KOH, LSNMF effectively reached a maximum current density of 3000 mA cm &#8722;2 . Most importantly, the difference between E ORR (at &#8722;1 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and E OER (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), &#916;E is 0.69 V, which stands among the best of recently reported perovskites. The as&#8208;designed LSNMF is stable, efficient, lucrative, and a promising candidate for practical application.</description>

                Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source for low-carbon and sustainable mobility purposes. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. The complex nature of the ORR and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows. Here, we present a state-of-the-art study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate ORR on platinum-based surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the great potentiality of quantum computers in solving notoriously difficult systems with strongly correlated electronic structures and suggest platinum/cobalt as ideal candidate for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.</description>

      <title>The V30 benchmark set for anharmonic vibrational frequencies of molecular dimers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0238491</link>

                Intermolecular vibrations are extremely challenging to describe but are the most crucial part for determining entropy and hence free energies and enable, for instance, the distinction between different crystal-packing arrangements of the same molecule via THz spectroscopy. Herein, we introduce a benchmark dataset&#8212;V30&#8212;containing 30 small molecular dimers with intermolecular interactions ranging from exclusively van der Waals dispersion to systems with hydrogen bonds. All the calculations are performed with the gold standard of quantum chemistry CCSD(T). We discuss vibrational frequencies obtained via different models starting with the harmonic approximation over independent Morse oscillators up to second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2), which allows a proper anharmonic treatment including coupling of vibrational modes. However, large amplitude motions present in many low-frequency intermolecular modes are problematic for VPT2. In analogy to the often used treatment for internal rotations, we replace such problematic modes by a simple one-dimensional hindered rotor model. We compare selected dimers to the available experimental data or high-level calculations of potential energy surfaces and show that VPT2 in combination with hindered rotors can yield a very good description of fundamental frequencies for the discussed subset of dimers involving small and semi-rigid molecules.</description>

      <title>NMR Investigations of Host&#8211;Guest Interactions in MOFs and COFs</title>

                Host&#8211;guest interactions in porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) play a key role in enhancing the performance of these materials for practical applications; however, it is often very challenging to investigate these interactions at the molecular level. In recent years, many solid-state NMR (SSNMR) approaches, including in situ variable temperature (VT), 2D correlation, and pulsed field gradient (PFG) experiments, have offered unique insights into the local structure and dynamics of adsorbed guest molecules in MOFs and COFs. Recent SSNMR studies of MOFs and COFs containing guest molecules are summarized in this chapter. These reports encompass a variety of gaseous and liquid guests such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and methanol. We also highlight studies involving larger guest molecules, drugs, and biomolecules. It is apparent that SSNMR spectroscopy can provide a wealth of data pertaining to host&#8211;guest interactions in these materials; the information available commonly includes the number and location of guest adsorption sites, guest binding strengths, guest dynamics and diffusion rates, and guest-induced structural changes in the host. The studies discussed in this chapter illustrate how SSNMR spectroscopy serves as a powerful tool to probe host&#8211;guest interactions in MOFs/COFs, especially given the variety of potential target nuclei and the numerous experimental strategies that are available.</description>

      <description>Rohit Sharma, Pawan Kumar, Anil Jakhar, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405369492

                Abstract A polycryst alline ceramic sample of calcium and cobalt co-doped Lanthanum Manganite (LCMCO) was synthesized via the autocombustion route and subjected to comprehensive characterization using various analytical techniques, namely XRD, SEM, FTIR and VSM. The sharp peaks are observed on XRD analysis conducted at room temperature, confirming the formation of single-phase compound with orthorhombic crystal structure and Pbnm space group. The lattice parameters were calculated using the Rietveld refinement tool Fullprof and are as follows: a = 5.4989 &#197;, b = 5.4265 &#197;, and c = 7.7217 &#197;. The XRD data also provided information on interplanar d spacing, atomic locations and other structural factors. Further examination through FESEM affirmed the diverse shapes and sizes of the prepared samples. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy unveiled a broad peak at 615 cm-1, corroborating the presence of metal-oxygen bonds organized into MnO6 octahedral structures. Magnetic studies employing VSM disclosed the antiferromagnetic nature of the prepared samples. The AFM nature and precise lattice structure make this compound a potential candidate for magnetic refrigeration system. Moreover, the diverse morphology along with AFM nature make them suitable for magnetic sensor applications.</description>
