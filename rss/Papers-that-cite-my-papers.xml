      <title>Variants of Surface Charges and Capacitances in Electrocatalysis: Insights from Density-Potential Functional Theory Embedded with an Implicit Chemisorption Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1103/prxenergy.3.043008</link>
      <description>Jun Huang, Fabiola Dom&#237;nguez-Flores, Marko Melander, PRX Energy. 3(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404414084

                Prevalent electrolyte effects across a wide range of electrocatalytic reactions underscore the general importance of the local reaction conditions in the electrical double layer (EDL). Compared to traditional EDLs, the electrocatalytic siblings feature partially charged chemisorbates that could blur our long-held views of surface charge densities and differential capacitances&#8212;two interrelated quantities shaping the crucial local reaction conditions. Herein, five variants of surface charge density and three variants of differential capacitance in the presence of chemisorbates are defined and compared. A semiclassical model of electrocatalytic EDLs is developed for a quantitative analysis of the differences and interrelationships between these variants of surface charge densities and differential capacitances. It is revealed that the potential- and concentration-dependent net charge on these chemisorbates dramatically changes the surface charge densities and differential capacitances. Specifically, the free surface charge density could decrease as the electrode potential becomes more positive, implying that the . The relationship between the free and total surface charge densities is analyzed with aid of the concept of electrosorption valency. By linking the electrosorption valency with the differential capacitance in the absence of chemisorbates, we explain the potential and concentration dependence of the former. The conceptual analysis presented in this work has important implications for experimental characterization and first-principles-based atomistic simulations of electrocatalysis and EDL effects. Particularly, we disclose a hidden yet potentially crucial disadvantage of widely employed atomistic simulation models that fix the coverage of chemisorbates. Proposing the self-consistent implicit model as an expedient remedy for this disadvantage, this work contributes to more realistic modeling of electrocatalytic EDLs.

      <title>Self&#8208;supported thin&#8208;film electrode consisting of transition metal borides for highly efficient hydrogen evolution</title>

                Abstract Transition metal borides (TMBs) are a new class of promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation by water splitting. However, the synthesis of robust all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrodes is challenging for practical applications. Herein, a facile solid&#8208;state boronization strategy is reported to synthesize a series of self&#8208;supported TMBs thin films (TMB&#8208;TFs) with large area and high catalytic activity. Among them, MoB thin film (MoB&#8208;TF) exhibits the highest activity toward electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), displaying a low overpotential ( &#951; 10 = 191 and 219 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and a small Tafel slope (60.25 and 61.91 mV dec &#8722;1 ) in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, it outperforms the commercial Pt/C at the high current density region, demonstrating potential applications in industrially electrochemical water splitting. Theoretical study reveals that both surfaces terminated by TM and B atoms can serve as the active sites and the H* binding strength of TMBs is correlated with the p band center of B atoms. This work provides a new pathway for the potential application of TMBs in large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts for Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Evolution: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225712</link>
      <description>Jing Wen, Siyuan Tang, Xiang Ding, Yin Yin, Fuzhan Song, Xinchun Yang, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404417724

                With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.</description>

      <title>Cu-Supported ZnO under Conditions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Methanol: Why 0.2 ML Coverage?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c02908</link>
      <description>Robert H. Lavroff, Edison Cummings, Kaustubh J. Sawant, Zisheng Zhang, Philippe Sautet, Anastassia N. Alexandrova, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404420877

                By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogeneous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers on the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a subnano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T of 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 of 4.5 atm and CO2 of 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on the surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at a lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, because of the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.</description>

                Abstract We present a comprehensive and user-friendly framework built upon the integrated development environment (IDE), enabling researchers to perform the entire Machine Learning Potential (MLP) development cycle consisting of (i) creating systematic DFT databases, (ii) fitting the Density Functional Theory (DFT) data to empirical potentials or MLPs, and (iii) validating the potentials in a largely automatic approach. The power and performance of this framework are demonstrated for three conceptually very different classes of interatomic potentials: an empirical potential (embedded atom method - EAM), neural networks (high-dimensional neural network potentials - HDNNP) and expansions in basis sets (atomic cluster expansion - ACE). As an advanced example for validation and application, we show the computation of a binary composition-temperature phase diagram for Al-Li, a technologically important lightweight alloy system with applications in the aerospace industry.</description>

                We present BEAST DB, an open-source database comprised of ab initio electrochemical data computed using grand-canonical density functional theory in implicit solvent at consistent calculation parameters. The database contains over 20,000 surface calculations and covers a broad set of heterogeneous catalyst materials and electrochemical reactions. Calculations were performed at self-consistent fixed potential as well as constant charge to facilitate comparisons to the computational hydrogen electrode. This article presents common use cases of the database to rationalize trends in catalyst activity, screen catalyst material spaces, understand elementary mechanistic steps, analyze the electronic structure, and train machine learning models to predict higher fidelity properties. Users can interact graphically with the database by querying for individual calculations to gain a granular understanding of reaction steps or by querying for an entire reaction pathway on a given material using an interactive reaction pathway tool. BEAST DB will be periodically updated, with planned future updates to include advanced electronic structure data, surface speciation studies, and greater reaction coverage.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the Layered-to-Spinel Phase Transformation in Li&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                The phase transition of layered Li0.5NiO2 to spinel Li(NiO2)2 is a potential degradation pathway in LiNiO2-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. We investigated the mechanism of this phase transformation from first principles. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, our results indicate a high energy barrier for the transformation due to high defect formation energies, a complex charge-transfer mechanism, and electronic frustration. Our results suggest that partially inverse spinel phases are unlikely to form for Li0.5NiO2, a qualitative difference from the chemically similar Li0.5MnO2, in which the transformation occurs at room temperature. We show that Ni and Li atoms do not migrate gradually to their respective spinel sites for the layered-to-spinel transformation to occur due to high defect formation energies. We investigated the charge ordering in layered phases along the LiNiO2&#8211;NiO2 composition line, finding a pronounced impact of the symmetry and space group on the layered-to-spinel transition in Li0.5NiO2. Finally, we evaluated the relative stability of different spinel space groups, finding that previously reported experimental observations are consistent with a temperature-averaged structure rather than the 0 K ground-state structure of the Li(NiO2)2 spinel.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is key to realizing a sustainable future for our society. However, the complex interface between electrocatalysts and electrolytes presents an ongoing challenge in electrocatalysis, hindering the accurate identification of effective/authentic structure-activity relationships and determination of favourable reaction mechanisms. Surface coverage and reconstruction analyses of electrocatalysts are important to address each conjecture and/or conflicting viewpoint on surface-active phases and their corresponding electrocatalytic origin,</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]Fullerene as Building Blocks for 2D Networks with Superior Stability and Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c13167</link>

                The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice structures with physical and chemical properties distinct from those of conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C24 networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesized monolayer polymeric C60. Monolayer C24 harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps, and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C24 are comparable to those of TiO2, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C24 and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface-active sites of C24 monolayers are three times more than that of their C60 counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion, and storage.</description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Performance and Kinetic Behavior of Anion&#8208;Intercalated Borate&#8208;Based NiFe LDH in Alkaline OER</title>

                Abstract The synthesis of hydrogen via water electrolysis is an important step towards resolving the energy crisis and impeding global warming, as hydrogen can be used as a green energy carrier. The oxygen evolution as one half&#8208;cell reaction (OER) is currently limiting efficient water splitting due to kinetic inhibition as well as a complex mechanism, causing a large overpotential. Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxides (LDH) were found to be suitable OER catalysts, as they are cost effective, stable and highly active. This work focuses on the intercalation of different organic and inorganic borates into the LDH interlayers to study their influence on OER. Besides activity and stability measurements, three borate candidates were chosen for a kinetic study, including steady&#8208;state Tafel analysis and reaction order plots. It was found that the Bockris pathway with the second step as rate&#8208;determining step was predominant for all three catalysts. Of all candidates, the intercalation of borate resulted in the highest performance, which was associated with a high reducibility affecting the active metal sites.</description>

                Abstract Insufficient bifunctional activity of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major obstruction to the application of rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries. The primary reason is the mutual constraint of ORR and OER mechanism, involving the same oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and demonstrating the scaling limitations of the adsorption energies. Herein, it is reported a high&#8208;valence Ir single atom anchored on manganese oxide (Ir SA &#8208;MnO x ) bifunctional catalyst showing independent pathways for ORR and OER, i.e., associated 4e &#8722; pathway on high&#8208;valence Ir site for ORR and a novel chemical&#8208;activated concerted mechanism for OER, where a distinct spontaneous chemical activation process triggers direct O &#9472; O coupling. The Ir SA &#8208;MnO x therefore delivers outstanding bifunctional activities with remarkably low potential difference (0.635 V) between OER potential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and ORR half&#8208;wave potential in alkaline solution. This work breaks the scaling limitations and provides a new avenue to design efficient and multifunctional electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Insight Into Intermediate Behaviors and Design Strategies of Platinum Group Metal&#8208;Based Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) can effectively convert the hydrogen energy through the hydrogen fuel cells, which plays an increasingly important role in the renewable hydrogen cycle. Nevertheless, when the electrolyte pH changes from acid to base, even with platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts, the HOR kinetics declines with several orders of magnitude. More critically, the pivotal role of reaction intermediates and interfacial environment during intermediate behaviors on alkaline HOR remains controversial. Therefore, exploring the exceptional PGM&#8208;based alkaline HOR electrocatalysts and identifying the reaction mechanism are indispensable for promoting the commercial development of hydrogen fuel cells. Consequently, the fundamental understanding of the HOR mechanism is first introduced, with emphases on the adsorption/desorption process of distinct reactive intermediates and the interfacial structure during catalytic process. Subsequently, with the guidance of reaction mechanism, the latest advances in the rational design of advanced PGM&#8208;based (Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh&#8208;based) alkaline HOR catalysts are discussed, focusing on the correlation between the intermediate behaviors and the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, given that the challenges standing in the development of the alkaline HOR, the prospect for the rational catalysts design and thorough mechanism investigation towards alkaline HOR are emphatically proposed.</description>

      <title>Predicted Influence of Organic Structure Directing Agents on Al Distributions in CHA Zeolites</title>

                The distribution of Al on a zeolite framework can have a determining influence on chemical and catalytic properties. Those distributions are typically determined during synthesis as influenced by cationic organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). Here we use density functional theory (DFT) to compare the Al directing influence of N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantyl ammonium (TMAda+), an OSDA commonly used to crystallize CHA zeolite, with four isomers that retain the adamantyl structure but relocate the nitrogen center. Low energy configurations balance electrostatics-driven maximization of Al&#8211;Al and minimization of Al&#8211;N separations, the latter more important in OSDAs with more accessible charge centers. Statistical thermodynamics are used to predict thermal equilibrium Al distributions and corresponding Al pair features as a function of OSDA. All distributions differ from those predicted through naive application of L&#246;wenstein's rule, disfavor the placement of two Al second-nearest-neighbor or within a single six-ring, and introduce different biases toward eight-membered rings and more remote Al. Results illustrate the potential to influence Al location through OSDA selection.</description>

                Electron transporting (n-type) polymeric mixed conductors are an exciting class of materials for devices with aqueous electrolyte interfaces, such as bioelectronic sensors, actuators, and soft charge storage systems. However, their charge transport performance falls short of their p-type counterparts, primarily due to electrochemical side reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To mitigate ORR, a common strategy in n-type organic semiconductor design focuses on lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level. Despite empirical observations suggesting a correlation between deep LUMO levels, low ORR, and enhanced electrochemical cycling stability in water, this relationship lacks robust evidence. In this work, we delve into the electrochemical reactions of n-type polymeric mixed conductors with varying LUMO levels and assess the impact of ORR on charge storage performance and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) operation. Our results reveal a limited correlation between LUMO levels and ORR currents, as well as the electrochemical operational stability of the films. While ORR currents minimally contribute to OECT channel currents under fixed biasing conditions, n-type films self-discharge rapidly at floating potentials in a capacitor-like configuration. The density functional theory analysis, complemented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, underscores the critical role of backbone chemistry in controlling O2-related degradation pathways and device performance losses. These findings highlight the persistent challenge posed by ORR in n-type semiconductor design and advocate for shifting the focus toward exploring chemical moieties with limited O2 interactions to enhance operational stability and performance at n-type film/water interfaces.</description>

                The development of multifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance for electrocatalyzing urea oxidation-assisted water splitting is of great significance for energy-saving hydrogen production. In this work, we demonstrate a novel heteroatom engineering strategy for development of B-doped Co as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that a B dopant can efficiently adjust the electron reconstruction of the exposure of Co sites nearby and facilitate electron transfer, resulting in an optimal d-band center along with a lower Gibbs free energy barrier. Ultimately, the obtained B&#8211;Co exhibits pH-universal HER properties in various electrolytes. A highly efficient HER performance with overpotentials as low as 27, 163, and 430 mV to &#8722;10, &#8722;100, and &#8722;500 mA cm&#8211;2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively, is observed for the B&#8211;Co electrode. More importantly, the UOR-assisted electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 1.55 V to produce the current densities of 50 mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in a 200 mV saving-energy potential compared to water electrolysis, demonstrating its high efficiency of hydrogen production in industrial applications.</description>

                Atomically dispersed metal-nitrogen-carbon materials (AD-MNCs) are considered the most promising non-precious catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but it remains a major challenge for simultaneously achieving high intrinsic activity, fast mass transport, and effective utilization of the active sites within a single catalyst.

      <title>Spinel oxide enables high-temperature self-lubrication in superalloys</title>

                The ability to lubricate and resist wear at temperatures above 600 &#176;C in an oxidative environment remains a significant challenge for metals due to their high-temperature softening, oxidation, and rapid degradation of traditional solid lubricants. Herein, we demonstrate that high-temperature lubricity can be achieved with coefficients of friction (COF) as low as 0.10-0.32 at 600-900 &#176;C by tailoring surface oxidation in additively-manufactured Inconel superalloy. By integrating high-temperature tribological testing, advanced materials characterization, and computations, we show that the formation of spinel-based oxide layers on superalloy promotes sustained self-lubrication due to their lower shear strength and more negative formation and cohesive energy compared to other surface oxides. A reversible phase transformation between the cubic and tetragonal/monoclinic spinel was driven by stress and temperature during high temperature wear. To span Ni- and Cr-based ternary oxide compositional spaces for which little high-temperature COF data exist, we develop a computational design method to predict the lubricity of oxides, incorporating thermodynamics and density functional theory computations. Our finding demonstrates that spinel oxide can exhibit low COF values at temperatures much higher than conventional solid lubricants with 2D layered or Magn&#233;li structures, suggesting a promising design strategy for self-lubricating high-temperature alloys. The authors develop an approach for enhancing the wear resistance and lubricity of metals at elevated temperatures of in oxidative environments, where traditional solid lubricants fail. By engineering surface oxidation in additively manufactured Inconel, they achieve low friction coefficients, between 0.10 and 0.32 at 600-900 &#176;C, through the formation of a spinel-based oxide layer.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Nitrogen Reduction Electrocatalyst with a Dual-Metal&#8211;Boron System: From High-Throughput Screening to Machine Learning</title>

                Recently, dual-metal catalysts have attracted much attention due to their abundant active sites and tunable chemical properties. On the other hand, metal borides have been widely applied in splitting the inert chemical bonds in small molecules (such as N2) because of their excellent catalytic performances. As a combination of the above two systems, in this work, 11 kinds of transition metal atoms (TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, and W) were selected to embed in boron-doped graphene (BG) to construct 66 dual-metal&#8211;boron systems, and their performances toward the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) were examined using first-principles simulations. Our results revealed that such a dual-TM@BG system exhibits excellent thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities, which facilitate the experimental synthesis. In particular, Fe&#8211;Fe- and Fe&#8211;Co-doped BG exhibit excellent performance for NRR, with the limiting potentials of &#8722;0.29 and &#8722;0.32 V, respectively, and both of them exhibit inhibitory effects on the H2 evolution reaction. Remarkably, the microkinetic modeling analysis revealed that the turnover frequency for the NH3 production on FeFe@BG reaches up to 7.27 &#215; 108 s&#8211;1 site&#8211;1 at 700 K and 100 bar, which further confirms its ultrafast reaction rate. In addition, the machine learning method was employed to further understand the catalytic mechanism, and it is found that the NRR performances of dual-TM@BG catalysts are closely related to the sum of radii of two TM atoms. Therefore, our work not only proposed two promising electrocatalysts for NRR but also verified the feasibility for the application of a dual-metal&#8211;boron system in NRR.</description>

                The present study explores the contributory benefits of PtPd catalyst nanoparticles supported on a mixed valence iron oxide (Fe3O4) and polypyrrole (PPy) composite for validation in both the ethanol oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium for low temperature direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs). The high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) for PtPd/PPy-Fe3O4 with smart intervention of Fe3O4 directly/indirectly in the EOR and ORR sequences makes this distinct catalyst a highly preferred choice in direct ethanol fuel cells with respect to reduced polarization loss, substantial current density output, and greater stability compared to the usual Pt or Pd single nanocatalysts supported over carbon, while the conducting polymer present in the composite matrix enhances the charge transfer ability within the direct ethanol fuel cell framework. The catalyst nanoparticles are found to be in the size range 4&#8211;5 nm, as revealed from structure and morphology studies. Ion chromatographic analysis quantifies the reaction intermediates, acetate and carbonate, to the extent of 366 and 251 ppm using 1 M ethanol solution, while a low yield of H2O2 is a testament to the major utility of the combinatorial approach in the ORR. The studies involved morphology determined through electron microscopy and electrochemical characterization with the help of potentiodynamic polarization and RDE-RRDE techniques. The catalytic preeminence of the nanostructured PtPd/PPy-Fe3O4 was manifested by the facile electrode kinetics at the anode and cathode, the low yield of H2O2 in the ORR, and the appreciable power density output of 47.65 mW/cm2 of the complete cell bearing enormous mass activity for both the EOR and ORR. This novel attempt of introducing the single robust catalyst at both ends ensures better catalyst utilization, imparts affordability, and avoids carbon corrosion in the fuel cell environment.</description>

      <title>MoZn-based high entropy alloy catalysts enabled dual activation and stabilization in alkaline oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq6758</link>
      <description>Yunjie Mei, J. X. Chen, Qi Wang, Y.. Guo, Hanwen Liu, W. Shi, Lin Cheng, Yifei Yuan, Yuhua Wang, Bao Yu Xia, Yonggang Yao, Science Advances. 10(47)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404563910

                It remains a grand challenge to develop electrocatalysts with simultaneously high activity, long durability, and low cost for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), originating from two competing reaction pathways and often trade-off performances. The adsorbed evolution mechanism (AEM) suffers from sluggish kinetics due to a linear scaling relationship, while the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) causes unstable structures due to lattice oxygen escape. We propose a MoZnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) incorporating AEM-promoter Mo and LOM-active Zn to achieve dual activation and stabilization for efficient and durable OER. Density functional theory and chemical probe experiments confirmed dual-mechanism activation, with representative Co-Co &#8224; -Mo sites facilitating AEM and Zn-O &#8224; -Ni sites enhancing LOM, resulting in an ultralow OER overpotential (&#951; 10 = 221 mV). The multielement interaction, high-entropy structure, and carbon network notably enhance structural stability for durable catalysis (&gt;1500 hours at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 ). Our work offers a viable approach to concurrently enhance OER activity and stability by designing HEA catalysts to enable dual-mechanism synergy.</description>

      <title>Nature of metal-support interaction for metal catalysts on oxide supports</title>

                The metal-support interaction is one of the most important pillars in heterogeneous catalysis, but developing a fundamental theory has been challenging because of the intricate interfaces. Based on experimental &#8206;data, interpretable machine learning, theoretical derivation, and first-principles simulations, we established a &#8206;general theory of metal-oxide interactions grounded in &#8206;metal-metal and metal-oxygen interactions. The theory applies to metal nanoparticles and atoms on oxide supports and oxide films on metal supports. We found that for late-transition metal catalysts, metal-metal interactions dominated the oxide support effects and suboxide encapsulation over metal nanoparticles. A principle of strong metal-metal interactions for encapsulation occurrence is formulated and substantiated by extensive &#8206;experiments including 10 metals and 16 &#8206;oxides. The valuable insights revealed on (strong) metal-support interaction advance the interfacial design of supported metal catalysts.</description>
