      <title>Size-dependent guest-memory switching of the flexible and robust adsorption characteristics of layered metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr1387</link>
      <description>Satoshi Watanabe, Shotaro Hiraide, Homare Arima, Akiko Fukuta, Miyuki Mori, Hideki Tanaka, Minoru T. Miyahara, Science Advances. 10(49)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405103471

                Flexible-robust metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique hybrid nature comprising both flexible and rigid framework characteristics, exhibit high potential for hydrocarbon separations. However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs.</description>

      <description>Chao Huang, Wei&#8208;Xue Li, Ping Qin, Qingdong Ruan, Dorsa Dehghan&#8208;Baniani, Xiang Peng, Babak Mehrjou, Paul K. Chu, Applied Physics Reviews. 11(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405103486

                Electrocatalysis is crucial for sustainable energy solutions, focusing on energy harvesting, storage, and pollution control. Despite the development of various electrocatalysts, understanding the dynamic processes in electrochemical reactions is still limited, hindering effective catalyst design. In situ Raman spectra have emerged as a critical tool, providing molecular-level insights into surface processes under operational conditions and discussing their development, advantages, and configurations. This review emphasizes new findings at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, especially interface water molecule state, during the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in recent years. Finally, the challenges and future directions for in situ Raman techniques in electrocatalysis are discussed, emphasizing their importance in advancing understanding and guiding novel catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Cycling Zinc Sites Promote Ruthenium Oxide for Sub-Ampere Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c04485</link>
      <description>Meihuan Liu, Xiaoxia Chen, Shiyu Li, C.Y. Ni, Yiwen Chen, Hui Su, Nano Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405113290

                Although iridium-based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, their exorbitant cost and scarcity severely restrict their widespread application. Herein, we introduce a promising alternative to iridium: zinc-doped ruthenium dioxide (TE-Zn/RuO2), which exhibits remarkable and enduring activity for acidic OER. In situ characterizations elucidate that the dynamic cycling of zinc dopants serves as both electron acceptors and donors, facilitating the activation of Ru sites at low overpotentials while thwarting peroxidation at high overpotentials, thus concurrently achieving heightened activity and robust stability. Additionally, the incorporation of zinc induces weakened Ru&#8211;O covalency, thereby stabling *OOH intermediates and instigating a sustained adsorbate evolution mechanism, dramatically stabilizing the RuO2 lattice. Importantly, the TE-Zn/RuO2 catalyst as an anode exhibits good stability over 300 h at a water-splitting current of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 in the PEMWE device, underscoring its considerable promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Novel Single-Atom Catalysts of Transition-Metal-Doped 2D AlN Monolayer as Highly Effective Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29235768</link>
      <description>Xiaopeng Shen, Qinfang Zhang, Molecules. 29(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405122489

                The single-atom catalysts (SACs) for the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) have garnered significant attention in recent years. The NRR is regarded as a milder and greener approach to ammonia synthesis. The pursuit of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts for the NRR continues to garner substantial interest, yet it poses a significant challenge. In this study, we employed density functional theory calculations to investigate the stability and catalytic activity of 29 transition metal atoms loaded on the two-dimensional (2D) AlN monolayer with Al monovacancy (TM@AlN) for the conversion of N2 to NH3. After screening the activity and selectivity of NRR, it was found that Os@AlN exhibited the highest activity for NRR with a very low limiting potential of &#8722;0.46 V along the distal pathway. The analysis of the related electronic structure, Bader charge, electron localization function, and PDOS revealed the origin of NRR activity from the perspective of energy and electronic properties. The high activity and selectivity towards the NRR of SACs are closely associated with the Os-3N coordination. Our findings have expanded the scope of designing innovative high-efficiency SACs for NRR.</description>

                Novel (KNbO 3 ) 1&#8722; x (Ba 2 FeNbO 6 ) x ( x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) solid solutions corresponding to K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 , K 0.64 Ba 0.36 Fe 0.18 Nb 0.82 O 3 , and K 0.46 Ba 0.54 Fe 0.27 Nb 0.73 O 3 compounds have been synthesized via molten salt method. X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms the formation of solid solutions, while transmission electron microscopy combined with energy&#8208;dispersive spectroscopy results demonstrates a homogeneous distribution of elements. The obtained solid solutions crystallized in a cubic crystal structure, whereas the parent KNbO 3 possesses an orthorhombic structure. The wide bandgap semiconductor KNbO 3 transformed into a visible&#8208;light&#8208;active material, with its bandgap energy reduced from 3.56 eV to &#8776;2.4 eV. The substitution of K in KNbO 3 with Ba is responsible for structural modification from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry, whereas both structural modification and the substitution of Nb with Fe correlated with optical properties. The photocatalytic activities of all obtained solid solutions are improved compared with the parent KNbO 3 and Ba 2 FeNbO 6 compounds for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. Among the series of solid solutions, K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 photocatalysts show the highest MB removal efficiency owing to its relatively higher surface area, suppressed charge carrier recombination, and more negative conduction band edge. Moreover, K 0.82 Ba 0.18 Fe 0.09 Nb 0.91 O 3 photocatalyst (0.1 g) combined with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to form a novel photo&#8208;Fenton system, achieving almost complete degradation of 100 mL of 10 mg L &#8722;1 MB dye in 30 min.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Sensitivity of Pourbaix Diagrams to Computational Protocols: Electrochemical Stability of Ni Oxides as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c06788</link>
      <description>Wenyu Sun, Nitish Govindarajan, Aditya Prajapati, Jeremy T. Feaster, Christopher Hahn, Sneha A. Akhade, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405189245

                Pourbaix diagrams stand as a useful tool in assessing and visualizing materials' electrochemical stability and are widely used for electrocatalyst design. However, their reliability hinges on the accuracy of the chemical potentials of involved phases, which may bear uncertainties and can be significantly impacted by decision-making steps in the computational protocol. This study introduces a robust sensitivity analysis framework, exemplified through a detailed examination of the computational Pourbaix diagram of Ni, the oxides of which are used as high-activity and cost-friendly catalysts for many electrochemical reactions. Quantities of interest derived from the Pourbaix diagram include the appearance and stability domain of the catalytically active Ni oxide phases along with the onset electrochemical potentials of phase transitions. These metrics can guide the design of operational conditions for Ni oxide electrocatalysts. We find that the employed DFT exchange-correlation functional has the most significant influence on the computed Pourbaix diagram. Uncertainties on crystal structures, along with their related ab initio energetics, are also found to affect the size of the phase stability domain. Higher-order coupling among input parameters is found to play a crucial role in influencing the appearance and distribution of Ni phases in the diagram. Our findings suggest a need to consider variations and uncertainties associated with the computational procedures on predicted Pourbaix diagrams for materials design.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/er/9529659</link>
      <description>Konlayutt Punyawudho, Mariyappan Raja Pugalenthi, Xiong Shu, Satoshi Kaneco, Tanakorn Wongwuttanasatian, Amnart Suksri, Laksamee Payattikul, International Journal of Energy Research. 2024(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405195150

                Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology is vital for a cleaner and more sustainable future, offering high efficiency, quiet operation, fuel flexibility, and zero&#8208;emission energy production with versatile applications. The drawbacks of PEMFC include its high cost, susceptibility to degradation, and challenges in scaling up production for commercial use. The gas diffusion layer (GDL), the catalyst layer (CL), and the polymer electrolyte are all very important parts of fuel cell technology. Through the optimization of these components, researchers may strive to develop fuel cells that are more efficient, cost&#8208;effective, durable, and high&#8208;performing, therefore enabling the provision of clean and sustainable energy. In this article, we have reviewed the various components of GDL, CL, and polymer electrolyte materials and their impact on the performance of PEMFC. The various characteristics of the GDL such as porosity, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and carbon materials, are fully discussed in this review article. These topics also cover the CL&#8217;s properties, including the catalyst, carbon support, ionomer, and solvent. Explore the different polymer electrolytes that are based on aliphatic Nafion and aromatic hydrocarbons&#8208;based membrane. Finally, this review paper gives suggestions for the way forward in regard to creating electrodes and electrolytes for PEMFCs that are cost&#8208;effective, efficient, and durable.</description>

      <title>2D MOF Structure Tuning Atomic Ru Sites for Efficient and Robust Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202410657</link>
      <description>Jia Wang, De Wang, Zelin Zhao, Ganggang Chang, Wei Guo, Jun Xu, Yinyu Xiang, Junrui Li, Junsheng Li, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405200807

                Abstract Developing cost&#8208;effective ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts as alternatives to commercial Pt/C is crucial for the advancement of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, the strong hydrogen adsorption of Ru&#8208;based catalysts restricts its activity. Herein, a strategy is reported to tune the electronic structure and improve mass transfer by implanting Ru atoms onto the (002) facet of two&#8208;dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Ru@ L ZIF (002) ) to optimize the d &#8208;band center ( &#949; d ) of Ru and the hydrogen spillover behavior. Benefiting from the ultrathin nanosheet structure and optimized &#949; d of Ru, the over&#8208;strong H adsorption energy is weakened and the electron/mass transfer is facilitated. Ru@ L ZIF (002) exhibits an overpotential of 9.2 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a long&#8208;lasting stability of 35 days at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . The mass activity and price activity of Ru@ L ZIF (002) is 2.9 and 14.7 times higher than Pt/C, respectively. More impressively, Ru@ L ZIF (002) delivers a cell voltage of 2.01 V at a high current density of 4 A cm &#8722;2 in PEMWE. The excellent long&#8208;term durability of 1200 hours operating at 4 A cm &#8722;2 with an ultralow decay rate of 7.5 &#215; 10 &#8722;3 mV h &#8722;1 has been achieved, making it promising as a cost&#8208;effective alternative to Pt/C catalyst for PEMWE applications.</description>

                Abstract Rutile RuO 2 is recognized for its outstanding acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and notable cost advantage compared to iridium oxide for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). However, the unsatisfactory stability of RuO 2 hinders its practical application. Here, we report a lattice modulation strategy to enhance both the OER activity and stability of RuO 2 . Interestingly, the newly synthesized Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 &#8208;RuO 2 , with Mo doped first and then Nb, presents the greatest lattice spacing and possesses an overpotential of merely 205 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which significantly outperforms Nb 0.05 Mo 0.15 &#8208;RuO 2 (239 mV), where Nb was doped first followed by Mo, as well as the initial RuO 2 (323 mV). Remarkably, Mo 0.15 Nb 0.05 &#8208;RuO 2 requires only 1.76 V to achieve 1 A cm &#8722;2 and exhibits exceptional stability in PEMWE testing, with a voltage rise of only 58 mV at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 for more than 80 h.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Activity Trend of Metal&#8208;Loaded Metal Nitride Catalysts for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Synthesis by a First&#8208;Principles Microkinetic Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202408863</link>
      <description>Qianqian Yang, Qijun Gao, Jia Song, Anqi Cheng, Xinhe Wu, Pengfei Liu, Hua Yang, Haiyang Yuan, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405201888

                Abstract Ammonia (NH 3 ) is one of the most widely produced chemicals globally, primarily synthesized through the Haber&#8208;Bosch process, which requires high temperatures and pressures. Dual&#8208;site catalysts can activate N 2 and H 2 at spatially separated sites, enabling efficient NH 3 synthesis under milder conditions. Despite the rapid experimental progress of the dual&#8208;site catalysts (e.g., Ni&#8208;LaN), the feasibility and design of dual&#8208;site catalysts are challenged recently. Herein, the different metal&#8208;loaded metal nitride catalyst models are employed, and their activity map for NH 3 synthesis is explored by the first&#8208;principles microkinetic simulation. The optimum active region of this type of dual&#8208;site catalyst is identified in terms of the formation energy ( E v ) of nitrogen vacancy (N vac ) on metal nitride and the adsorption energy ( E H ) of hydrogen atom on metal cluster, with E v and E H ideally located around &#8776;1.50 and &#8776;&#8722;0.30 eV, respectively. This offers a framework for designing effective metal&#8208;loaded metal nitride catalysts for NH 3 synthesis. Importantly, this trend aligns with and rationalizes the current experimental observations of metal&#8208;loaded metal nitride reported for NH 3 synthesis. This theoretical work provides significant insights into NH 3 synthesis on dual&#8208;site mechanism, and provides a rational direction for designing metal&#8208;loaded metal nitride catalysts.</description>

                In the instantaneous global industrialisation, there has been an increase in the generalised waste, one of the major pollutants of wastewater. There should be advancements in the existing wastewater treatment technologies to cater for the current water demands. Wastewater treatment requires the oxidation and reduction of organic and drug molecules. Conventional wastewater technologies are expensive for such degradation, and the treatment efficiency is inadequate per the current demands. Hence microbial fuel cells, which are affordable, multi-applicability systems, should be considered for wastewater treatment technologies. This study analyses various country- and industry-wise wastewater production to demonstrate microbial fuel cell treatment technology requirements. According to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), this review also thoroughly discusses the Life Cycle Assessment of various types of Microbial Fuel Cells in order to observe which microbial fuel cells could be applied for different levels of wastewater accumulated geologically as well as industrially. For a thorough treatment of wastewater through MFCs, the review also economically analysed the microbial fuel cells both component-wise and unit-wise, especially towards scale-up. A comprehensive socioeconomic and technological perspective has also been portrayed in order to showcase the need to transition from conventional wastewater treatment technologies towards microbial fuel cells.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) utilization technology is of great significance for achieving carbon neutrality, in which the catalytic materials play crucial roles, and among them, single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) are of particular interests. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning are employed to assess the effectiveness of Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;host SAAs as catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH. The Gibbs free energies of 477 elementary reactions across 35 SAAs involved in CO 2 reduction are calculated, and by utilizing this dataset, a trained gradient boosting regression model is established with an excellent accuracy. Subsequently, the properties of 46 unknown SAAs are predicted, including their pathways, products, potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS), and corresponding Gibbs free energies of the PDS ( G PDS ). Three promising candidates, ZnCu, AuAg and MoNi, stand out due to their lowest G PDS among Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208; and Ni&#8208; hosted SAAs, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the increase of the melting temperature of water confined in one-dimensional nano-cavities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0239452</link>
      <description>Flaviano Della Pia, Andrea Zen, Venkat Kapil, Fabian L. Thiemann, Dario Alf&#232;, Angelos Michaelides, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405247918

                Water confined in nanoscale cavities plays a crucial role in everyday phenomena in geology and biology, as well as technological applications at the water&#8211;energy nexus. However, even understanding the basic properties of nano-confined water is extremely challenging for theory, simulations, and experiments. In particular, determining the melting temperature of quasi-one-dimensional ice polymorphs confined in carbon nanotubes has proven to be an exceptionally difficult task, with previous experimental and classical simulation approaches reporting values ranging from &#8764;180 K up to &#8764;450 K at ambient pressure. In this work, we use a machine learning potential that delivers first principles accuracy (trained to the density functional theory approximation revPBE0-D3) to study the phase diagram of water for confinement diameters 9.5 &amp;lt; d &amp;lt; 12.5 &#197;. We find that several distinct ice polymorphs melt in a surprisingly narrow range between &#8764;280 and &#8764;310 K, with a melting mechanism that depends on the nanotube diameter. These results shed new light on the melting of ice in one-dimension and have implications for the operating conditions of carbon-based filtration and desalination devices.</description>

                Abstract This review highlights recent advances in machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted design of energy materials. Initially, ML algorithms were successfully applied to screen materials databases by establishing complex relationships between atomic structures and their resulting properties, thus accelerating the identification of candidates with desirable properties. Recently, the development of highly accurate ML interatomic potentials and generative models has not only improved the robust prediction of physical properties, but also significantly accelerated the discovery of materials. In the past couple of years, ML methods have enabled high&#8208;precision first&#8208;principles predictions of electronic and optical properties for large systems, providing unprecedented opportunities in materials science. Furthermore, ML&#8208;assisted microstructure reconstruction and physics&#8208;informed solutions for partial differential equations have facilitated the understanding of microstructure&#8211;property relationships. Most recently, the seamless integration of various ML platforms has led to the emergence of autonomous laboratories that combine quantum mechanical calculations, large language models, and experimental validations, fundamentally transforming the traditional approach to novel materials synthesis. While highlighting the aforementioned recent advances, existing challenges are also discussed. Ultimately, ML is expected to fully integrate atomic&#8208;scale simulations, reverse engineering, process optimization, and device fabrication, empowering autonomous and generative energy system design. This will drive transformative innovations in energy conversion, storage, and harvesting technologies.</description>

      <title>Coaxial Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Boost Acid Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

                Abstract Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e &#8722; ORR) under acidic conditions is promising. However, constructing a highly efficient acid&#8208;resistant 2e &#8722; ORR electrocatalyst is critical but challenging. Herein, a coaxial cobalt single&#8208;atom catalyst on carbon nanotubes (Co SA &#8208;N&#8208;C/CNTs) is designed and synthesized by an ingenious separation chemical vapor deposition (SCVD) strategy, which achieves higher ORR activity, dominated 2e &#8722; selectivity, and superior stability in acid, compared to the counterpart nanoparticle catalyst prepared by traditional mixture pyrolysis. The as&#8208;assembled electrode using Co SA &#8208;N&#8208;C/CNTs catalyst demonstrates a high H 2 O 2 yield in excess of 2000 mmol g cat &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 with a Faraday efficiency of &gt;90% over 100 h without decay in a flow cell, as superior to the most reported acidic H 2 O 2 production catalysts. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that such excellent 2e &#8722; ORR performance of Co SA &#8208;N&#8208;C/CNTs originate from the combined advantages of strongly coupled coaxial core&#8211;shell structure and highly dispersed single&#8208;atom property. Most importantly, a series of other coaxial transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M SA &#8208;N&#8208;C/CNTs, M = Fe, Cu, or Ni) are prepared through this SCVD strategy, and they all show enhanced ORR performance, demonstrating universality.</description>
