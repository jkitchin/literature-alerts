      <title>Electrosynthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Waste Nitrates: History, Recent Progress, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202515635</link>
      <description>Yi-Fan Zhou, Gaoshan Xing, Chenghan Sun, Zekun Chen, Shuying Li, Rui Yang, Meng Chen, Pan Zhang, Changrui Feng, Abuliti Abudula, Guoqing Guan, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413337462

                Abstract Electrosynthesis of urea from carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and waste nitrates has gained increasing attention as a sustainable alternative to conventional urea production methods, offering a promising route to simultaneously convert CO 2 and waste nitrates into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, current urea electrosynthesis still faces challenges such as low Faradaic efficiency and ultralow urea yield rate, which hinder its practical application. To address these limitations, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing more effective electrocatalysts with high activity and high selectivity through various strategies. This review systematically covers the history of urea electrosynthesis, particularly highlighting recent advances, focusing on the development of electrocatalysts and electrolyzers for the electrosynthesis of urea from CO 2 and waste nitrates. Furthermore, catalysis mechanisms and the theoretical prediction for the catalyst design are discussed. In addition, the key challenges in this field, along with perspectives on future research directions, are outlined.</description>

                We report ground-state structures and phase transitions in $\mathrm{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}5[001]$ tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in body-centered-cubic (bcc) refractory metals Nb, Ta, Mo, and W. $\mathrm{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}5$ tilt GBs have been extensively investigated over the past several decades, with their ground-state structure---composed of kite-shaped structural units---previously thought to be well understood. By performing a rigorous GB structure search that optimizes the number of atoms in the boundary core, we predict different quasiaperiodic ``split kite'' phases analogous to those previously found in GBs in face-centered-cubic metals. Our results suggest that complex aperiodic phases of GBs appear to be a general phenomenon, as validated through density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the atoms in the split kite phase demonstrate distinct collective diffusion dynamics. Phase-contrast image simulations of split kites show better agreement with experimental observations, offering an alternative explanation for previous microscopy results and motivating future atomically resolved imaging of the GB structure.</description>

                CO 2 reduction catalyst corrosion and H 2 evolution remain challenging under the strongly acidic electrolyte. Here, Ga-modulated SnO x was investigated to achieve a good Sn &#948;+ oxidation state stability for durable (&gt; 4000 hours) acidic CO 2 reduction to HCOOH. Under pH 1.7, catalysts achieved a partial current density of 440 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;1.63 V RHE and the highest single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) of 91.9%. In a 10 cm 2 electrolyzer, a total current of ~986.3 milliampere is exhibited for more than 4000 hours with Faradaic efficiency of HCOOH (FE HCOOH ) higher than 82% and SPCE higher than 50%. Mechanism study indicates that lattice oxygen anchoring effect of Ga due to its strong oxygen affinity establishes a stable framework, reinforcing interface Sn&#9472;O bonds and protecting the Sn &#948;+ from the heavy self-reduction process. The robust structure of catalyst and modulated active Sn &#948;+ sites elevate the CO 2 reduction activity. The durable and highly efficient catalytic system exhibits the potential for industrial applications of the Ga-modulated SnO x .</description>

      <title>Accelerated Discovery of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c01616</link>

                Due to the outstanding thermal stability, inherent high melting points, and elevated temperature strengths, refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have been widely used for extreme environments in aerospace, nuclear energy, and advanced propulsion systems. Herein, we present an integrated design and simulation framework for RHEAs, combining machine learning potentials, supervised regression models, and multiobjective optimization algorithms. Utilizing a universal neuroevolution potential version 1 (UNEP-v1), the framework significantly enhances the accuracy of atomic-scale simulation while substantially reducing computational cost. High-throughput molecular dynamics simulations generate melting points and ultimate tensile strengths at 1000 K for various alloy compositions. Supervised regression models enable a rapid performance prediction. Integrating Shapley Additive exPlanations, Partial Dependence Plots, Accumulated Local Effects, and Individual Conditional Expectation analysis can provide a comprehensive interpretability toolkit. Validation of the proposed method in the TiVCrZrMo alloy system demonstrates its efficacy in designing high-strength, high-temperature resistant alloys. We not only develop a precise and interpretable predictive modeling paradigm but also establish procedural frameworks, promoting the integration of atomic-scale simulations with data-driven approaches for RHEAs in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Advances in Atomic Iron Catalysts for Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202513188</link>
      <description>Qiuyue Lu, Zhenl&#252; Wang, Jingqi Guan, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413373235

                Abstract The severe environmental issues triggered by the overuse of fossil energy have propelled the development of energy conversion and storage technologies. Oxygen electrocatalysis, including oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), has attracted widespread attention as the key reaction of many energy devices. Increasing research has demonstrated the exceptional potential of atomic iron catalysts in oxygen electrocatalysis, offering promising prospects for advancing these technologies. Building upon an analysis of the mechanisms underlying oxygen electrocatalysis and integrating insights from characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, this paper systematically summarizes the strategies for regulating the electronic structure of atomic iron catalysts, including coordination environment, metal active center, and substrate modulation. Then, given that the stability of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts remains a fundamental bottleneck hindering their development, optimization strategies including adjusting the Fe&#9472;N bond length, reducing H 2 O 2 attack, and improving the graphitization degree of the carrier are proposed. Furthermore, the applications in energy storage and conversion devices are reviewed. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities for atomic iron catalysts are discussed, offering insights for the development of more advanced Fe&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

                Atomically dispersed metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M-N-C) catalysts are regarded as ideal catalytic materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. Compared with other ORR catalysts, M-N-C catalysts exhibit notable advantages, including low cost, high atomic utilization efficiency, and considerable catalytic potential. We provide a systematic review of recent research advances in enhancing the ORR performance of M-N-C catalysts, focusing on catalytic activity and stability. First, the reaction mechanism of the ORR on the surfaces of the M-N-C catalysts is elucidated. Second, the primary strategies employed in recent years to improve their catalytic activity and stability are summarized. Finally, critical research directions that should be prioritized to expedite the commercialization of M-N-C catalysts are outlined.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Accelerated First-Principles Molecular Dynamics Reveals C&#8211;C Coupling Mechanisms toward Ethylene on Cu(100)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5c02726</link>
      <description>Timothy T. Yang, Wissam A. Saidi, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413381326

                The Cu(100) termination has been identified as the most effective facet for converting CO and CO2 into ethylene. To enhance both the activity and selectivity of ethylene production, we perform machine-learning-accelerated, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations at 298 K in an explicit solvent at pH 7 to elucidate the C&#8211;C coupling mechanism&#9472;the critical reaction step in forming C2+ products. Among the six potential C&#8211;C coupling pathways, the most feasible are CO* dimerization and CO &#8211; CHO* and CHO* &#8211; CHO* couplings. Using the computational hydrogen electrode method, we demonstrate that all three pathways are equally accessible at &#8722;0.6 V vs RHE. At a potential below &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE, the thermodynamic barriers for the CO &#8211; CHO* and CHO* &#8211; CHO* pathways become negligible. Our computational findings explain the experimental observations, particularly the absence of C2+ products above &#8722;0.4 V vs RHE and the peaks in ethylene production near &#8722;0.6 and &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE. Since CHO* acts as a key intermediate common to both C&#8211;C coupling and CH4 formation, we propose that suppressing CHO* hydrogenation would inhibit CH4 pathways, thereby maximizing ethylene selectivity.</description>

      <title>PtCo/C Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts on Various Carbon Supports: Synthesis, Structure, and Activity in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                This study is concerned with examining the effect of carbon support type on the properties of PtCo/C core&#8211;shell materials synthesized via a three-step method for use as catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in low-temperature fuel cells. The PtCo/C catalysts were examined using thermogravimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, total reflection X-ray fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption technique, cyclic voltammetry, and linear sweep voltammetry. The results revealed variations in the composition, structure, and ORR catalytic activity of the materials depending on the type of initial support. The PtCo/C core&#8211;shell materials synthesized on an N-doped KetjenBlack EC-300J support exhibited the largest active surface area (over 100 m2/g(Pt)), a high specific activity of approximately 500 A/g(Pt) at a potential of 0.9 V, and the most positive half-wave potential of 0.93 V. These characteristics significantly surpass those of a commercial Pt/C analogue. Testing of the synthesized PtCo/C catalyst on a doped carbon support within a membrane electrode assembly confirmed enhanced catalytic activity compared to that of its commercial counterpart. Thus, this study demonstrates that the use of an N-doped support for depositing bimetallic PtCo core&#8211;shell nanoparticles through multistage wet synthesis significantly improves the performance of cathode catalysts for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.</description>

                Structural dependability of Tokamak fusion reactors has to be taken into account while selecting reactor components. Heat- and energy-producing fusion events can change reactor walls. Reactions thus produce less efficiently the energy needed. For example, graphene is the fundamental building block used in fusion reactors to create their walls. Among the newest high-tech materials is graphene. We investigated the effect of tritium plasma ions with energy ranging from 5 to 35 keV on graphene walls using molecular dynamics simulations. To study the surface topology, we calculate the tritium retention count, since molecular dynamics gives a snapshot of the actual world in the molecular model setup. The surface tritium plasma atom retention calculation is completed by determining the graphene's Weibull distribution reliability based on the retention count assumption.</description>

                Abstract Developing durable ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) remains challenging due to irreversible Ru dissolution and lattice oxygen instability. Although elemental doping is a general method to improve stability, it inadvertently induces oxygen vacancies (V O s), which are randomly distributed in the nanocatalyst. Notably, the impact of V O distribution on the stability of Ru&#8208;based catalysts remains unresolved. Herein, we synthesized the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide via annealing the mixture of ruthenium (III) chloride and selenium (Se) in the air (Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuO x ) with the presence of urea, showing the V O s distributed away from Se dopants, which is significantly different from the Se&#8208;doped Ru oxide synthesized without urea (Se&#8208;RuO x ), showing V O s distributed relatively close to the Se dopants. The Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuO x demonstrates superior oxygen evolution reaction performance over Se&#8208;RuO x . Particularly, Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuO x delivers a low working voltage (1.62 V@1 A cm &#8722;2 ) and excellent durability (&gt;1000 h@200 mA cm &#8722;2 ) in PEMWE tests. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that V O s engage in long&#8208;range cooperation with spatially decoupled Se dopants in Ur&#8208;Se&#8208;RuO x , synergistically enhancing reaction kinetics via an intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism, while inhibiting the lattice oxygen mechanism and suppressing Ru dissolution, which demonstrates a new strategy to break the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off in promising Ru&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

                Abstract The successful commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) hinges on the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts capable of overcoming key performance limitations. In this study, the core&#8211;shell Au@Pd pentatwinned decahedral nanoparticles has been synthesized with controlled Pd shell thicknesses, varying in the average number of Pd monolayers over the Au core. This core&#8208;shell configuration promotes the epitaxial growth of Pd atoms with varying degrees of tensile strain. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that increasing tensile strain shifts the d&#8208;band center closer to the Fermi level. Notably, when the Pd shell is three monolayers, the upward shift of the d&#8208;band center is maximum, and this further amplified by the ligand effect from the underlying Au core. The synergistic influence of five twin boundaries, tensile strain, and ligand interactions collectively tunes the d&#8208;band center, resulting in the Au@Pd&#8208;3 catalyst achieving an exceptional mass activity of 25.67 A mg Pd &#8722;1 and a specific activity of 21.30 mA cm &#8722;2 , representing enhancements of 38.31&#8208;fold and 11.39&#8208;fold, respectively, over commercial Pd/C. This study highlights how the combined effects of strain and ligand interactions can be strategically harnessed to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts by tuning the position of d&#8208;band center.</description>

                The "crude oil exodus" and energy transition will finally hinge on the availability of hydrogen. Catalytic processes like the water&#8211;gas shift (WGS) reaction may significantly contribute to its production and become crucial for utilizing alternative feedstocks. This work demonstrates how thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters can be employed as precursors for single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts. The clusters serve as carriers of heteroatom dopants (Cu, Pd) while precisely maintaining 25 metal atoms per cluster (&lt;1 nm). Using the 2PET ligand during synthesis led to high yield and cluster stability, but ligand exchange was required to link clusters to a ZnO support efficiently. Introducing pMBA as a ligand enabled a homogeneous cluster distribution on the ZnO surface, creating a well-defined catalyst with dual functionality. This SAA catalyst, outperforming a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 benchmark in WGS, may get industrial relevance when upscaled while still serving as a well-defined model system in catalysis. Thereby, it bridges the gap between practical applications and fundamental research. Pre- and postreaction analysis by XPS proved the presence of the dopants in the catalysts in the expected stoichiometry, showed changes in the electronic structures, but also revealed sulfur migration from the clusters/ligands to the support, forming ZnS. Furthermore, XPS unveiled a pretreatment-induced SMSI decoration effect, stabilizing the small particles during catalysis. (S)TEM indicated a homogeneous cluster distribution on ZnO after synthesis and proved small particle sizes throughout the experiments. In situ DRIFTS confirmed the accessibility of the dopant atoms by the reactant CO and also detected adsorbed byproducts. The precise size and doping control of thiolate-protected SAA nanoclusters, together with their catalytic performance, demonstrate the potential for targeted future investigations in a wide range of industrial applications.</description>

                Reducing noble metal dependence in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is essential for achieving sustainable and scalable green hydrogen production. Bimetallic oxides, with their potential for high catalytic performance and reduced noble metal content, represent promising alternatives to traditional IrO 2 -based OER catalysts. However, optimizing these materials remains challenging due to the complex interplay of elemental selection, composition, and chemical ordering. In this study, we integrate density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Bayesian learning to accelerate the discovery of high-performance, low-Ir bimetallic oxides, identifying surface Ir-doped TiO 2 as an optimal catalyst. Guided by theoretically optimized surface compositions and oxygen vacancies, we synthesized atomically dispersed Ir on TiO 2 , achieving a 23-fold increase in Ir mass-specific activity and a 115-millivolt reduction in overpotential compared to commercial IrO 2 . This work exemplifies a sustainable, data-driven pathway for electrocatalyst design that minimizes noble metal usage while maximizing efficiency, advancing scalable solutions in renewable energy and hydrogen production.</description>

                Abstract We construct and employ a machine-learning potential to perform molecular dynamics simulations on BaTiO 3 nanoparticles. The potential constructed in this study successfully reproduce rhombohedral, orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases observed in bulk BaTiO 3 at different simulation temperatures, as well as surface properties. We consider cubic-shaped and spherical nanoparticles to study how the shape and surface structures influence the structural and dielectric properties. Based on our analysis of the displacement vectors of titanium atoms relative to the surrounding oxygen atoms (corresponding to dipole moments), the surface structure strongly affects the order of the displacement vectors even near the center of the particle. A tetragonal-like order appears in cubic-shaped nanoparticles around a diameter of 11.6 nm while a similar order cannot be seen in an 18 nm spherical nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>Understanding Strain Effects on IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                Understanding how strain influences the electronic and geometric properties of surface active sites and the activity and stability of the iridium oxide-catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has significant scientific and technological implications for designing next-generation electrocatalysts. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial surface strains on the OER activity and stability of the IrO2(110), IrO2(100), and IrO2(101) surfaces. Our results reveal significant changes in the adsorption free energies of the OER intermediates due to strain, which in turn influences the OER activity. Furthermore, we evaluate how the electronic structure of IrO2 surface atoms varies with strain, leading to a fundamental theoretical understanding of strain effects. Our theoretical analysis further accounts for the effects of strain in the presence of a nearby surface Ir vacancy and high surface oxygen coverage, representing realistic surfaces under OER conditions. This work expands the current understanding of strain-assisted activity and stability enhancements in OER catalysts, paving the way for the development of strain-engineered electrocatalysts.</description>

                NH3 is an efficient hydrogen carrier and a crucial chemical in various industrial various applications. In comparison to the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising green alternative technology. Therefore, exploring NRR electrocatalysts with excellent performance is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, density functional theory calculations were employed to explore the potential of transition metal (TM) atoms anchored on defective CuO surface formation TM@CuO catalysts. The thermodynamic stability of TM@CuO structures was confirmed through binding energy calculations. The high catalytic activity of Nb@CuO, Mo@CuO, Ru@CuO, and Ta@CuO was successfully determined by screening the free energy of the potential-determining step and comparing with the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. The simulation of the entire pathway showed that the limiting potentials of Mo@CuO and Ru@CuO were &#8722;0.358 and &#8722;0.540 V, respectively. Furthermore, the charge density difference, Bader charge, density of states, and crystal orbital Hamiltonian population of Mo@CuO and Ru@CuO were analyzed, and the reasons for their excellent catalytic activity were identified. The research result of this study is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the rational design of new NRR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>In Situ Structural Evolution and Activity Descriptor of Atomically Dispersed Catalysts During Nitrate Electroreduction</title>

                Abstract Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts (SAC) have emerged as a promising class of materials for various catalytic applications, including the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (eNO 3 RR) and consequently ammonia production. While the efficiency and selectivity of these materials have been extensively highlighted for the eNO 3 RR, the in situ evolution to their structure and composition during electrocatalysis is largely unexplored and lacks catalyst design principles. To solve this, we investigated a series of high utilization metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) SACs (M = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) for eNO 3 RR. Except for CuNC, which selectively produced nitrite, all catalysts exhibited Faradaic efficiencies (FE) for ammonia exceeding 50%. NiNC demonstrated the highest performance (FE of 78.0 &#177; 2.9% at &#8722;0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at pH 13 and maximum ammonia production rate of 615.7 &#177; 176.5 &#181;mol&#183;h &#8722;1 &#183;, corresponding to an energy efficiency of 15.1 &#177; 1.4% at &#8722;0.6 V RHE ), followed by CoNC. In situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray fluorescence (SXRF) mapping at various cathodic potentials (from open circuit potential to 0.0 V RHE and then &#8722;0.6 V RHE at 100 mV steps) revealed significant mobility of Ni within the carbon matrix, leading to the formation of metallic clusters from 0.0 V RHE . Similar in situ metal clustering is observed for CoNC. Structure&#8208;activity plots are generated from both MNC literature and results obtained here, finding a clear trend between OH binding energy and turnover frequency, with the high activity of NiNC and CoNC in this work explained by their stronger OH binding in the metallic structure compared to their SAC coordination. This work therefore, reveals the structure&#8208;activity&#8208;stability of MNCs for eNO 3 RR and provides a simple descriptor for identifying highly active eNO 3 RR catalysts and their in situ structural evolution.</description>

                Designing alternative OER catalysts to IrO2 has been a long-standing and compelling task in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEM-WE). Currently, the more active and less expensive RuO2 has attracted extensive attention, with the primary consideration being how to improve its long-term stability. Thus, disclosing the underlying factors and mechanisms contributing to its high activity and low stability is significant. Herein, we employ Grand Canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling (MKM) to comprehensively elucidate the potential-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms on the RuO2(110) facet. Our results confirm the dominant role of AEM and the less likely occurrence of LOM and OPM on the pristine RuO2(110) surface. This work not only deepens the mechanistic understanding of OER on RuO2 from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives but also provides a basis for achieving a rational design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Operando TEM Study of Partial Oxidation of Methane Over Pd Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202507303</link>

                Abstract Methane (CH 4 ), which constitutes over 95% of low&#8208;cost and abundantly available natural gas reserves, represents a key feedstock for producing syngas and other value&#8208;added chemicals. Developing catalysts capable of efficiently converting CH 4 into these chemicals is, therefore, crucial for reducing the dependence on limited crude oil resources. Despite the importance of these conversion reactions, the underlying details of catalyst activity remain elusive. Here, using operando gas&#8208;cell transmission electron microscopy, the nanoscale mechanisms of the catalytic partial oxidation of CH 4 over Pd nanoparticles (NPs) are explored. The observations show that the onset of the catalytic reaction directly coincides with the transformation of these NPs into robust fragmented Pd&#8211;PdO NPs. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Pd&#8211;PdO interface plays a pivotal role in optimizing the reaction pathway: metallic Pd facilitates CH 4 dehydrogenation, while PdO promotes C oxidation. These insights into the active structures of catalysts under working conditions provide a foundation for the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Induced Suppression of Singlet Oxygen in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries with Extended Cycle Life</title>

                Abstract Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O 2 ) batteries are perceived as a promising breakthrough in sustainable electrochemical energy storage, utilizing ambient air as an energy source, eliminating the need for costly cathode materials, and offering the highest theoretical energy density (~ 3.5 kWh kg &#8211;1 ) among discussed candidates. Contributing to the poor cycle life of currently reported Li&#8211;O 2 cells is singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) formation, inducing parasitic reactions, degrading key components, and severely deteriorating cell performance. Here, we harness the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of chiral cobalt oxide nanosheets (Co 3 O 4 NSs) as cathode materials to suppress 1 O 2 in Li&#8211;O 2 batteries for the first time. Operando photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a 3.7-fold and 3.23-fold reduction in 1 O 2 during discharge and charge, respectively, compared to conventional carbon paper-based cells, consistent with differential electrochemical mass spectrometry results, which indicate a near-theoretical charge-to-O 2 ratio (2.04 e &#8722; /O 2 ). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that chirality induces a peak shift near the Fermi level, enhancing Co 3 d &#8211;O 2 p hybridization, stabilizing reaction intermediates, and lowering activation barriers for Li 2 O 2 formation and decomposition. These findings establish a new strategy for improving the stability and energy efficiency of sustainable Li&#8211;O 2 batteries, abridging the current gap to commercialization.</description>

                This work reports the synthesis and electropolymerization of 4&#8208;aminophenoxy&#8208;substituted Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine to prepare a phenazine (PNZ)&#8208;bridged Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine polymer as a durable catalyst for heterogeneous electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECO 2 R). At &#8211;1.19 V versus normal hydrogen electrode, the ECO 2 R under catalysis of the target polymer effectively produces CO with 94% faradaic efficiency (FE CO ), CO partial current density of 5.5 mA cm &#8722;2 , and turnover frequency of 1.1 s &#8722;1 over 2 h. Moreover, the polymeric system exhibits remarkably higher stability than the monomeric one by achieving average FE CO , current density and a turnover number of up to 93%, 7 mA cm &#8722;2 and 5.3 &#215; 10 5 , respectively, along 120&#8208;h electrolysis. Variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry indicates efficient electron transfer within polymeric bulk through the PNZ linkage, while in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals a higher proportion of electrochemically active Co I species in the polymer film than the monomer one. In addition, density functional theory calculations using the real&#8208;space GPAW framework are conducted to investigate charge penetration in the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer network in comparison to that in the monomeric counterpart. These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of the robust Co II &#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based catalyst and contribute to the progress of an efficient CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.</description>

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrocatalysts due to their unique structural features and superior physicochemical properties. A key breakthrough in this field is the development of ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials (&lt;5 nm), which establish HEAs as sufficiently advanced catalysts with extremely superior performance. Despite rapid progress, a comprehensive review of the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;activity relationships of sub&#8208;5 nm HEA nanomaterials is still absent. This review provides the first systematic overview specifically focusing on sub&#8208;5 nm ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials for electrocatalytic applications. In particular, this review comprehensively summarizes recent research on ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials, focusing on their synthesis strategies, characterization methods, unique properties, and electrocatalytic applications, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR), and formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Furthermore, this work originally proposes some unique advantages of ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials, including the enhanced utilization of metal atoms, optimal binding energy, and remarkable nano&#8208;size effects. Meanwhile, it discusses the challenges and future directions for ultrasmall HEA nanomaterials. This work aims to offer valuable insights for advancing the field and the development of efficient electrocatalysts for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Surface Defects on WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Photoelectrodes for Catalyzing Chloride Oxidation in Water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.5c01806</link>

                Tungsten oxide (WO3) is an n-type semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies (&#9633;O&#8226;&#8226; in Kroger-Vink notation) or surface protonation as HxWO3. It is one of the few acid-stable oxides under large positive bias, which makes WO3 ideal for interrogating the mechanism of the chloride oxidation reaction (COR). The large, positive valence band edge of &#8764;3 eV provides the overpotential necessary to carry out the COR, but the reaction competes with the oxygen-evolution reaction in water. The &#9633;O&#8226;&#8226; defect density can be controlled by the atmosphere under which the material is annealed, so WO3 films were prepared by a spin-coating method from an ammonium metatungstate precursor annealed at 500 &#176;C under air, flowing O2, and flowing argon. Annealing the films in a flowing O2 atmosphere hinders the formation of &#9633;O&#8226;&#8226;, and annealing in Ar leads to greater surface W6+, likely due to expelling intercalated H+. The saturated photocurrent density (jph) is highest in films with the greatest concentration of W5+ and greatest concentration of oxide defects: (0.66 mA/cm2 annealed in air, 0.58 mA/cm2 annealed in Ar, and 0.49 mA/cm2 annealed in O2, reported at 1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, pH 3 (before the onset of a dark reaction). The defect concentrations are determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In all cases the Faradaic efficiency for the COR is near unity. Finally, we demonstrate that W 5d states can be probed by ligand K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy via pre-edge (Cl 1s &#8594; W 5d) transitions, lower in energy than the ligand-centered (Cl 1s &#8594; 4p) transition. We use this analysis to show the presence of W&#9472;Cl covalent bonds on the WO3 films post-COR, corroborated by DFT calculations. This result stands in contrast to the commonly assumed mechanistic proposal invoking outer-sphere electron transfer to a physisorbed chloride ion.</description>

                Two-dimensional (2D) S-scheme heterojunctions have garnered significant interest, owing to their remarkable redox capability and excellent potential in solar energy harvesting. In the work, a 2D/2D S-scheme heterojunction consisting of monolayer Bi2O2Se and Bi2WO6 was designed, and its performance in photocatalytic water splitting was comprehensively investigated using first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction features well-aligned electronic band structures and generates an intrinsic built-in electric field directed from Bi2O2Se toward Bi2WO6. The internal electric field promotes effective charge separation via the S-scheme mechanism, significantly reducing carrier recombination and improving the dissociation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Furthermore, Gibbs free energy calculations indicate that solar energy can drive spontaneous water splitting of the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction. Owing to its efficient S-scheme charge migration and strong light-harvesting capability across a wide spectral range, the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 heterojunction exhibits an impressive solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency that reaches 23.48%. These findings demonstrate that the Bi2O2Se/Bi2WO6 S-scheme heterojunction is a highly promising and stable photocatalyst for efficient solar-driven hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Surface local strain and diatomic iron doping synergistically promote the plasmonic photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0281781</link>
      <description>Tai-Rui Wu, Ziwei Ma, Jiazheng Wang, Jian&#8208;Zhang Zhou, De&#8208;Yin Wu, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(8)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413600242

                Utilizing single/dual atom catalysts as well as the crystallographic plane effect to promote the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted extensive attention. However, there are few works to combine the two effects with the surface plasmon resonance effect based on the first-principles periodic slab models. Our calculated results can be summarized as three points. First, we investigated the adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) of *N2 and *NNH on Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) facets with single or dual Fe atoms doped. The strongest end-on and side-on adsorption occur at single and dimer Fe atoms doped Au(100) surfaces, respectively. More importantly, the N2 side-on adsorption configuration significantly reduces the &#916;G of the first hydrogenation step. Second, we investigated the reason why there is a lower adsorption &#916;G for the N2 side-on adsorption on dimer-Fe-doped Au(100). It was discovered that the interatomic distance of the Fe dimer exhibits a strong correlation with adsorption strength. When the Fe dimer is doped on the Au(100) surface, the dimer will relax due to local strain, enabling a stronger N2 side-on adsorption. Finally, we compared the photon absorption capacity between side-on and end-on nitrogen adsorption configurations, revealing that the latter exhibits enhanced light absorption capability at lower photon energies and across broader wavelength ranges. This theoretical research highlights the superiority of the N2 side-on adsorption configuration in plasmonic photoelectrochemical NRR and shows the influence of surface local strain and dynamic relaxation for side-on adsorption, which could be referenced to design efficient side-on adsorption catalysts.</description>
