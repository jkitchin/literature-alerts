      <title>Nitrogen-Passivated germanium carbide nanomeshes as potential catalysts for photocatalytic water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-11711-6</link>
      <description>Sarah Gamal, Ghada E. Khedr, M. Nashaat, L.M. Salah, Ahmed A. Maarouf, Nageh K. Allam, Scientific Reports. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412499951

                Nitrogen-passivated germanium carbide (GeC) nanomeshes have been systematically investigated as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The nanomesh, characterized by a lattice constant of 19.3 &#197; and a pore diameter of 7.3 &#197;, maintains a planar architecture with optimized N-Ge and N-C bond lengths of 1.8 &#197; and 1.3 &#197;, respectively. Partial density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that the conduction band is predominantly governed by Ge states, while C states dominate the valence band. Nitrogen incorporation critically alters the electronic structure near the band edges, significantly influencing photocatalytic behavior. Notably, introducing porosity reduces the bandgap from 2.04 eV (pristine GeC) to 1.33 eV in the N-passivated configuration. The calculated band edge positions straddle the redox potentials of water, indicating thermodynamic feasibility for overall water splitting. Several favorable sites were identified for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with nearly thermoneutral &#916;G values, suggesting high catalytic efficiency. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the formation of OH* was determined to be the rate-limiting step with a &#916;G1 = 1.84 eV. Bader charge analysis confirmed electron transfer from the OH* species to the adjacent Ge atom, resulting in a net gain of 0.39 |e| by Ge. These findings demonstrate that N-passivated GeC nanomeshes exhibit a favorable electronic structure and catalytic surface characteristics for photocatalytic water splitting.</description>

      <title>Graph&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Framework for Screening Selective Propane Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>

                Abstract High&#8208;throughput computational screening is a powerful approach in accelerating the identification of highly selective and stable catalysts. However, it is often hindered by lack of generalized descriptors and the complexity of handling numerous multidentate adsorption configurations. In this study, we propose a computational framework integrating graph theory and python&#8208;based databasing tools with robust catalytic descriptors to enable high&#8208;throughput screening of alloys for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. We derive mechanistic Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Evans&#8208;Polanyi (BEP) correlations for C&#9472;H and C&#9472;C bond breaking, highlighting the role of metastable binding configurations in transition states involving more than three surface atoms. Although activity and stability descriptors exhibit strong scaling, these descriptors are uncorrelated, enabling construction of a pareto&#8208;optimal line identifying alloys with the best balance between activity and selectivity. Known optimal catalysts, including PtZn, PdZn, PtSn, and PdIn, lie on this pareto&#8208;optimal line validating the framework. Furthermore, Ir and Rh, typically known for hydrogenolysis, can be engineered for high selectivity by site&#8208;isolating active ensembles with high promoter compositions. Experimental validation confirms that Ir 1 Sn 1 remains highly stable and selective over 15 h. Overall, our approach highlights the power of generalized descriptors combined with high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental benchmarking to extract key mechanistic insights and computationally design novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Behavior of Complex Aqueous Electrolytes Using Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: The Case of Sodium Sulfate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.5c02306</link>
      <description>Ademola Soyemi, Tibor Szilv&#225;si, The Journal of Physical Chemistry B. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412506428

                Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in the 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M), which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns-long simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Performance on Metal Foam Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202516242</link>
      <description>Yongkang Li, Rundong Zhao, Qiuyu Yan, Ling Lu, Zhenhua Wu, Lihong Yu, Le Liu, Jingyu Xi, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412510389

                Abstract Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable ammonia (NH 3 ) synthesis and the remediation of nitrate&#8208;contaminated wastewater. However, the catalytic pathways for NO 3 RR vary across different catalyst surfaces, which in turn affects the kinetics and selectivity of product formations. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a unified performance quantification for NO 3 RR among commonly used catalysts. In this work, transition metal&#8208;based foam electrodes&#8212;iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper, which are widely used as catalysts or substrates due to their excellent conductivity, high specific surface area and catalytic activity are systematically evaluated and compared to enable quantitative comparison of catalytic performance. Through comprehensive characterization of NO 3 RR performance metrics, a standardized evaluation framework is established. Furthermore, advanced in situ optical imaging reveals the dynamic evolution of NH 3 , intermediate nitrite, and hydrogen bubbles during NO 3 RR, uncovering critical mechanistic insights and guiding the subsequent targeted loading and modification of catalysts. In addition, the zinc&#8208;nitrate battery performance based on foam electrodes is also standardized and unified.</description>

      <title>Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster Riveted by Uneven Charged Traps toward Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5c01922</link>
      <description>Zhaodi Wang, Wenyan Sun, Wenyan Li, Ya&#8208;Kun Lv, Yingying Wang, Peng Peng, Inorganic Chemistry. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412524051

                Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) possessed promising potentials for catalytic applications but were hindered by the intrinsic charge-carrier mobility and the exposure of active sites. To this point, our work developed the uneven charged traps strategy to realize the homogeneous dispersion and immobilization of atomically precise silver nanoclusters (Ag6) and obtained an Ag cluster-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst with enhanced performance. As expected, the uneven charged traps derived by graphitized nitrogen-doped carbon (NDC) extended the effective catalytic active area, tuned the electrical environment, and facilitated the binding between ORR intermediates and the active sites. Compared with pure Ag6 nanoclusters, Ag6@NDC possessed nearly 160 times higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and dramatically decreased electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In alkaline media, the overall catalytic performance of Ag6@NDC with only 3.64 wt % Ag was even superior to commercial 20 wt % Pt/C. This work not only offered a successful showcase to enhance the catalytic performance of atomically precise MNCs but also provided highly efficient alternatives for both electrocatalytic applications and mechanism studies.</description>

      <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient and Scalable Joule Heating Synthesis of Self&#8208;Standing Transition Metal Phosphide Electrodes for Full Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) show promise as low&#8208;cost (pre)electrocatalysts for water splitting and other energy&#8208;related applications. However, their traditional synthesis methods face challenges in energy consumption, stability, and reproducibility due to the reaction at high temperatures. Here, the Joule heating (JH) method for the scalable synthesis of TMPs (Ni, Cu, and In) as self&#8208;standing electrodes and powders is presented. The JH synthesis demonstrates substantial economic efficiency and significantly reduces energy consumption and environmental impacts while enhancing reproducibility due to fast processing times. Large&#8208;scale nickel phosphide&#8208;based electrodes are synthesized with various transition metal dopants and assembled into an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer as anode and cathode, maintaining a cell potential of a maximum of 1.8 V at 200 mA cm&#8315; 2 under 55 &#176;C for 7 days. These results highlight the JH synthesis as a promising approach for the scalable production of high&#8208;performance self&#8208;standing electrodes for energy&#8208;related devices.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced dynamics of CO on Ru(0001): Understanding experiments by simulations with all degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0278850</link>
      <description>Bruno Mladineo, J. I. Juaristi, M. Alducin, Peter Saalfrank, Ivor Lon&#269;ari&#263;, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 163(4)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4412578065

                Real-time pump&#8211;probe experiments are powerful tools for monitoring chemical reactions but often need parallel theoretical modeling to disentangle different contributions. Monitoring x-ray spectra of photoinduced dynamics of CO on Ru(0001) provided a strong indication for a transient &#8220;precursor state&#8221; of unidentified nature to various subsequent outcomes. So far, the precise nature of the postulated precursor has also remained elusive in state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics models, including single-moving CO molecules. In the present work, we have constructed a density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential energy surface that is valid for all ionic degrees of freedom of the system, comprising many molecules at various coverages and moving surface atoms. Our Langevin dynamics with electronic friction based on the new potential energy surface identified the precursor state as dynamically trapped molecules around 6 &#197; from the surface that arise from adsorbate&#8211;adsorbate interactions. We have compared our results to experimental observations and calculated the dependence of reaction probabilities on pump laser fluence and initial surface coverage.</description>

      <title>Innovative Strategies for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Layered Double Hydroxide&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/slct.202502680</link>

                Abstract Layered double hydroxides (LDH) catalysts are widely used in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but are limited by their low conductivity, few active sites, and poor stability. For this reason, various modification strategies have emerged. In this review, the mechanistic explanation direction of the OER performance enhancement of modified LDH was elaborated from a mechanistic point of view, which mainly includes the heterostructure&#8208;dominated synergistic effect, doping&#8208;induced lattice distortion and multi&#8208;element electronic interaction. The substantial improvements in OER performance achieved through LDH modification can be considered by focusing on the above three mechanisms. Subsequently, a detailed exploration of the existing shortcomings in the explanation of LDH modification mechanisms for OER was conducted. By addressing these gaps, we aim to offer more effective guidance for the rational design and broad application of LDH&#8208;based catalysts in OER processes in the future.</description>
