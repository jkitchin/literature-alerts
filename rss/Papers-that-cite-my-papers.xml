      <title>Applied electric field induced the change of spin-electron of the Fe3GeTe2 to improve its oxygen evolution reaction performance</title>

                Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the influence of the external electric field on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of monolayer Fe3GeTe2. Monolayer Fe3GeTe2 has ferromagnetic metal properties and displays excellent electrocatalytic activity. The magnetism mainly comes from FeI atoms, owing to the strong Fe-Te orbitals hybridization, and FeI atoms have great effect on the active site Te atoms. The electric field induces the change of spin-electron and promotes charge redistribution in the Fe3GeTe2, resulting in the changes of the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE). Simultaneously, the applied electric field shifts the energy band and decreases the work function which facilitates carrier migration to the surface. Therefore, the OER overpotential is reduced and the catalytic performance is improved. These valuable findings can serve as vital references for the design of 2D magnetic electrocatalysts.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial semireaction in water electrolysis and rechargeable metal-air batteries, is vital for carbon neutrality. Hindered by a slow proton-coupled electron transfer, an efficient catalyst activating the formation of an O-H bond is essential. Here, we proposed a straightforward one-step hydrothermal procedure for fabricating PO</description>

      <title>Carbon Corrosion Induced by Surface Defects Accelerates Degradation of Platinum/Graphene Catalysts in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract Graphene supported electrocatalysts have demonstrated remarkable catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, their durability and cycling performance are greatly limited by Oswald ripening of platinum (Pt) and graphene support corrosion. Moreover, comprehensive studies on the mechanisms of catalysts degradation under 0.6&#8211;1.6 V versus RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) is still lacking. Herein, degradation mechanisms triggered by different defects on graphene supports are investigated by two cycling protocols. In the start&#8211;up/shutdown cycling (1.0&#8211;1.6 V vs. RHE), carbon oxidation reaction (COR) leads to shedding or swarm&#8211;like aggregation of Pt nanoparticles (NPs). Theoretical simulation results show that the expansion of vacancy defects promotes reaction kinetics of the decisive step in COR, reducing its reaction overpotential. While under the load cycling (0.6&#8211;1.0 V vs. RHE), oxygen containing defects lead to an elevated content of Pt in its oxidation state which intensifies Oswald ripening of Pt. The presence of vacancy defects can enhance the transfer of electrons from graphene to the Pt surface, reducing the d&#8722;band center of Pt and making it more difficult for the oxidation state of platinum to form in the cycling. This work will provide comprehensive understanding on Pt/Graphene catalysts degradation mechanisms.</description>

                In this study, nickel ferrite (NiFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles were synthesized using the hydrothermal method at various pH values. The objective was to investigate the influence of pH variation on particle size and electrocatalytic activity. The formation of cubic phase nanoparticles was confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. To characterize the electrochemical properties, the nickel ferrite nanoparticles were coated onto a stainless steel substrate using the doctor blade technique. The microstructural analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were further analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The average crystallite size, determined from the XRD pattern, was approximately 40 nm. SEM images revealed a conversion from nanoplates to a granular morphology. The synthesized electrode exhibited an overpotential of 392 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and demonstrated good stability for 5 hours. These findings highlight the excellent electrocatalytic activity of nickel ferrite nanoparticles for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</description>

                Abstract It is still a challenge to develop electrocatalyst for the efficient adsorption and conversion of organic molecule in aqueous media. Herein, a hetero&#8208;interface structure based on CuO@Ni(OH) 2 is rationally designed to enhance the performance of benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzoic acid. A high Faradaic efficiency of 99% and the yield of 3.09 mmol cm &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 are achieved at 1.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming the previously reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free flow electrolyzer was assembled based on CuO@Ni(OH) 2 hetero&#8208;interface, exhibiting a much high yielding of benzoic acid (6.73 mmol cm &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 ) and hydrogen (0.35 L cm &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 ) with excellent stability. Both experimental data and density functional theory calculations verify that the electron is tend to accumulate at the hetero&#8208;interface, thus accelerating the adsorption of reactant and intermediate and reducing the energy barrier of the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid.</description>

                Abstract The proactive exploration of electrocatalytic conversion for renewable energy valorization is of tremendous significance in addressing the issues of fossil energy exhaustion, among which the critical challenge of electrocatalysis lies in the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts that are rich in the earth. Among electrocatalysts, the design of heterostructured materials exhibits immense potential for the optimization of noble metals and elaboration of non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts with durability. In this review, a systematic overview of modern advances in heterostructured electrocatalysts for a range of energy conversion reactions is described, and special interfacial design brings additional functional effects. Subsequently, various synthesis methods and characterization techniques for heterostructured electrocatalysts are also summarized. The innovative classification of heterostructures in methods of interfacial junction, crystal structure, structural morphology, and properties of the components is presented in this review. Finally, the possible challenges and outlooks of heterostructured electrocatalysts in the future are further discussed, including how to develop more sophisticated synthesis, characterization, and theoretical calculation methods, which will serve as the guiding direction for a more rational interface design. This review aims to set the trajectory for providing meaningful inspiration and references in energy conversion by heterostructured electrocatalysts, advancing the process of carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Tuning Two-Dimensional Phthalocyanine Dual Site Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c02229</link>

                Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer an interesting opportunity for catalysis, particularly for metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) motifs by providing an organized porous structural pattern and well-defined active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a key need for hydrogen fuel cells and related sustainable energy technologies. In this work, we leverage electrochemical testing with computational models to study the electronic and structural properties in the MOF systems and their relationship to ORR activity and stability based on dual transitional metal centers. The MOFs consist of two M1 metals with amine nodes coordinated to a single M2 metal with a phthalocyanine linker, where M1/M2 = Co, Ni, or Cu. Co-based metal centers, in particular Ni&#8211;Co, demonstrate the highest overall activity of all nine tested MOFs. Computationally, we identify the dominance of Co sites, relative higher importance of the M2 site, and the role of layer M1 interactions on the ORR activity. Selectivity measurements indicate that M1 sites of MOFs, particularly Co, exhibit the lowest (&lt;4%), and Ni demonstrates the highest (&gt;46%) two-electron selectivity, in good agreement with computational studies. Direct in situ stability characterization, measuring dissolved metal ions, and calculations, using an alkaline stability metric, confirm that Co is the most stable metal in the MOF, while Cu exhibits notable instability at the M1. Overall, this study reveals how atomistic coupling of electronic and structural properties affects the ORR performance of dual site MOF catalysts and opens new avenues for the tunable design and future development of these systems for practical electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Improving NiFe Electrocatalysts through Fluorination&#8208;Driven Rearrangements for Neutral Water Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Neutral electrolysis to produce hydrogen is prime challenging owing to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for the electrochemical reduction of water to molecular hydrogen. An ion&#8208;enriched electrode/electrolyte interface for electrocatalytic reactions can efficiently obtain a stable electrolysis system. Herein, we found that interfacial accumulated fluoride ions and the anchored Pt single atoms/nanoparticles in catalysts can improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of NiFe&#8208;based hydroxide catalysts, prolonging the operating stability at high current density in neutral conditions. NiFe hydroxide electrode obtains an outstanding performance of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 at low overpotential of 218 mV with 1000 h operation at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the interfacial fluoride contributes to promote the adsorption of Pt to proton for sustaining a large current density at low potential, while the Pt single atoms/nanoparticles provide H adsorption sites. The synergy effect of F and Pt species promotes the formation of Pt&#9472;H and F&#9472;H bonds, which accelerate the adsorption and dissociation process of H 2 O and promote the HER reaction with a long&#8208;term durability in neutral conditions.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Binary Covalent Alloy Space to Pursue Superior Nitrogen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>

                Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has the potential to decarbonize industrial ammonia production. However, NRR has poor activity and selectivity versus the competing hydrogen evolution reaction for catalysts that adhere to scaling relations. Overcoming the limitations imposed by scaling relations requires more complex catalyst materials, however, evaluating materials beyond simple metal systems is a large combinatorial problem that requires an improved understanding of the electrocatalyst surface to rationally guide the discovery of superior catalysts. The study uses grand canonical density functional theory to uncover NRR trends on a large and disparate set of binary covalent alloys (BCA) with variable compositions and active&#8208;site geometries. The studied BCAs generally follow scaling relations, albeit with larger variance and several systems that significantly break scaling. BCAs with early&#8208; to mid&#8208;transition metals tend to lie near the volcano peak and activate the N 2 triple bond via a side&#8208;on binding configuration. Trends in the BCA space cannot be readily predicted using simple electronic descriptors, which is ascribed to the large geometric variability of the BCA surfaces. It is anticipated that these findings will provide a foundation for the rational design of superior NRR electrocatalysts with increasing material complexity.</description>

      <title>Towards non-blinking perovskite quantum dots</title>

                Abstract Surface defect-induced photoluminescence blinking is ubiquitous in lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Despite efforts to passivate the defects on perovskite QDs by chemically engineering ligand binding moieties, blinking accompanied by photodegradation still poses barriers to studying and implementing quantum-confined perovskite QDs in quantum emitters. We posited that the intermolecular interaction between ligands can affect the QD surface passivation. In the solid state, steric repulsions among bulky ligand tails prevent adequate QD surface ligand coverage. Alternatively, attractive &#960;-&#960; stacking between low-steric phenethylammonium (PEA) ligands promotes the formation of a nearly epitaxial surface ligand layer. Here, we demonstrate that single CsPbBr3 QDs covered by these PEA ligands are nearly non-blinking, with single photon purity reaching 98%. Moreover, these QDs exhibited no spectral shifting and photodegradations, and they remained blinking-free after 12 hours of continuous operation. Free of interferences from blinking and photodegradation, we present size-dependent exciton radiative rates and emission line widths of single CsPbBr3 QDs ranging from strongly to weakly confined regimes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the effect of solvent for hydrogen evolution in Pt-doped MXenes and corresponding high-entropy phase</title>

                Effect of solvent at the water/solid interface plays a non-negligible role in chemical reactions. Explicit solvation has been proved for its important effect on thermodynamics and kinetics of catalytic reactions. However, systematic studies about this perspective are still absence. In this work, using the model of single platinum atom immobilized on the metal vacancies of a series of MXenes, we systematically investigate the implicit/explicit solvent effect on their catalytic performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that the solvent effect plays a significant role in affecting the calculation results for some systems. For TiNbC-PtNb, the value of &#916;GH* decreases from -0.121 to -0.511 (-0.583) eV when considering implicit (explicit) correction, implying the decisive role of solvent effect for calculating HER in this system. Bader charge analysis and AIMD simulations reveal that TiNbC-PtNb surface is sensitive to H2O, thus causing this abnormal case. Surprisingly high-entropy phases of MXene overall are less sensitive to solvent compared to the pure phases, which could be due to their alloyed lattice with a strong ability against electronic and lattice fluctuations induced by solvent. Several systems like V2C-PtV, TiMoC-PtMo, and VNbC-PtV are predicted to be excellent electrocatalysts for alkaline HER with the appropriate Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and kinetic barrier of water. The perspective exemplified in this work highlights that more feasible operando should be considered, e.g., influence of water, to better simulate the reaction process. Our work suggests that Pt-doped MXenes are perfect systems for hosting atomic catalyst as well.</description>

                In this work, we investigate how exploiting symmetry when creating and modifying structural models may speed up global atomistic structure optimization. We propose a search strategy in which models start from high symmetry configurations and then gradually evolve into lower symmetry models. The algorithm is named cascading symmetry search and is shown to be highly efficient for a number of known surface reconstructions. We use our method for the sulfur-induced Cu (111) (43&#215;43) surface reconstruction for which we identify a new highly stable structure that conforms with the experimental evidence.</description>

                This chapter examines alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) electrolysis, exploring both its advantages and challenges. A comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of water electrolyzers is provided. This is followed by a detailed discussion on the advantages and challenges faced by AEM electrolyzers in comparison to alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE) and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMWE). AEM chemistry and degradation mechanism was reviewed. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis is discussed in terms of the activity descriptors, mechanism, and performance across a wide range of pH levels. Conclusion and recommendation were made on the advancement required in AEM water electrolyzers performance, durability and scale up challenges to enable rapid deployment and competitive green hydrogen production to meet global NetZero hydrogen ambitions.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2R) is a promising approach for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels using renewable energy sources. We investigated the mechanism of eCO2R for a small Cu8 cluster placed on SnO2 containing O vacancies using density functional theory and predicted current density and selectivity by microkinetics simulations within the computational hydrogen electrode model. Low and high H coverages were modeled by Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x models, using statistical methods to identify their most stable structures. Different CO2 adsorption modes on Cu8/SnO2-x and Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface models, all containing an O vacancy, resulted in distinct reaction pathways, leading to either HCOOH or CO. The preferred formation of HCOOH occurred upon CO2 adsorption on an O vacancy on the Cu8H6/SnO2-x surface, followed by sequential hydrogenation to HCOO and HCOOH. Adsorption of CO2 on Cu8/SnO2-x opened a facile pathway to CO. Electronic structure analysis revealed that differences in charge donation of Cu to the antibonding orbitals of CO2 can explain the predicted selectivity differences. The preferred adsorption mode of CO2 is bidentate at the Cu-SnO2-x interface. Our findings emphasize the role of H coverage on Cu on the selectivity of eCO2R for Cu/SnOx catalysts.</description>

      <title>A First-Principles and Machine Learning Study on Design of Graphitic Carbon Nitride-Based Single-Atom Photocatalysts</title>

                Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation offers an efficient, environmentally friendly, and energy-saving approach for ammonia synthesis. In this study, semiconductor materials, particularly graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) combined with single metal atoms, were theoretically investigated to identify promising candidates as nitrogen fixation photocatalysts. Initially, six different single 3d transition-metal atoms, i.e., V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, were loaded onto g-C3N4, and the optimal single-atom catalyst, Fe@g-C3N4, was selected through reaction energy calculations. This catalyst demonstrated excellent performance in terms of the electronic structure and light absorption properties. Furthermore, machine learning methods were applied to a limited sample set to predict a catalyst with a superior performance beyond the computational samples. Utilizing a backward elimination method and sure independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) training, the key descriptors correlated with the target properties of the catalysts were identified. The SISSO descriptors, consisting of structural and electronic characteristic parameters, are interpretable and provide meaningful insights. Importantly, a catalyst, Ru@g-C3N4, with outstanding performance was predicted and verified by density functional theory calculations. This catalyst design strategy demonstrates promising results with limited computational data, highlighting the potential of combining theoretical simulations with machine learning methods for catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Recent developments of single atom alloy catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.152072</link>
      <description>Zehua Jin, Yuting Xu, Manjeet Chhetri, Joseph Wood, Brian Torreon, Fanglin Che, Ming Yang, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396721231

                This review discusses the recent developments of single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts toward CO2, CO, N2, and NO3&#8211; hydrogenation reactions in the electrocatalysis context, a natural expansion from the thermal catalysis origin where the concept of SAA was born and validated. Electrocatalytic hydrogenations of CO2, CO, NO3&#8211;, and N2 into value-added chemicals offer an attractive general route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions using renewable energy without H2 feed stream. These reactions typically involve multiple electron-transfer-coupled elementary reaction steps that are of broad relevance to many electrocatalytic applications, making them well-positioned for translational fundamental studies relevant to other emerging electrochemical reactions. While there has been exciting progress in SAA research for various thermal catalytic reactions in the last decade, the design, application, and characterization of SAA catalysts in electrocatalysis remain nascent with intriguing uncertainties and ample opportunities. We highlight the recent research findings in this growing area, where the SAAs, owing to their unique doped metal properties and atomically precise bimetallic synergies, promote selective reaction pathways by tuning binding energies and distributions of adsorbates/intermediates.

      <title>Boron-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating as an efficient electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                The Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have demonstrated remarkable durability. Enhancing the Ir-based electrocatalytic activity still remains crucial owing to the scarcity of iridium. Here, a high-temperature sintering technique is employed to fabricate a boron (B)-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating with an almost perfect rutile-type crystal structure on a corrosion-resistant titanium substrate, ensuring exceptional stability for the acidic OER. The B-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode fabricated in a mixed solution of 0.6 M H3BO3, exhibits an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a lower Tafel slope of 34.2 mV dec&#8722;1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is far lower than the 272 mV overpotential and the 45.3 mV dec&#8722;1 of the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode. The electrode possesses a minimal potential increase even after undergoing continuous OER for 400 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of B species into IrO2-Ta2O5 effectively fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ir active sites, leading to a substantial enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study provides promising prospects for reducing the energy consumption of noble IrO2-based electrocatalysts in the practical application of electrochemical industry for the acidic OER.</description>

                In the application of renewable energy, the oxidation&#8211;reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two crucial reactions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6&#8211;x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.</description>

      <title>The Bell-Evans-Polanyi relation for hydrogen evolution reaction from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-024-01244-3</link>

                Abstract The versatile Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relation stipulates the kinetics of a reaction in terms of thermodynamics. Herein, we establish the BEP relation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from fundamental electrochemical principles leveraging the Butler-Volmer relation for a one-step, one-electron process and the transition state theory. Based on first-principles investigations of HER mechanisms on fourteen metal electrodes, we firmly justify the BEP relation solely using an easy-to compute hydrogen adsorption free energy and universal electrochemical constants.</description>
