      <title>Comprehensive Approach to Carbon Capture Value Chain Development Challenges and Cost-Effective Solutions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/226810-ms</link>
      <description>Lu&#237;s Ferreira Pires, Satyajeet Kawathekar, Peter Dewar, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413897401

                Abstract This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the carbon capture and storage value chain, focusing on cost optimization strategies and frameworks for successful development. Through systematic evaluation of capture-transport-storage components, we identify critical cost drivers and demonstrate methodologies for economic optimization in early-stage project development. Carbon capture technologies constitute the primary cost component, accounting for 60-80% of total chain (IEA 2024), with post-combustion systems exhibiting energy penalties of 25-35% compared to 15-20% for advanced solvents (Environmental Science &amp; Technology 2024). Transportation costs range from 0.25-55.82 euros per tonne depending on distance and flowrate, while storage costs demonstrate significant variability based on geological conditions and monitoring requirements (MDPI 2024). Cost optimization analysis confirms that cluster and hub models achieve 30-40% cost reductions compared to standalone facilities when maintaining utilization rates above 80% (World Economic Forum 2025). The Northern Lights and Porthos projects early implementation results provide encouraging indicators of successful multi-stakeholder collaboration approaches (Equinor. 2024; Port of Rotterdam. 2024). Digital cost estimation methodologies enable progressive accuracy improvement until final investment decision, supporting systematic project optimization throughout development phases.</description>

      <title>Modeling water using multipole response tensors fitted to the monomer geometry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0279764</link>

                The water molecule&#8217;s electronic Cartesian multipole moment and polarizability tensors have been fitted with Gaussian process regression to the internal coordinates and are used to evaluate accurate electrostatic, induction, and dispersion energy components between flexible molecules. The model yields a handful of damping and scaling parameters that were adjusted for the energy components to agree with 2-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory decomposition and then fine-tuned in order for the total energy to agree with CCSD(T) for small clusters. We present a simple algorithm for rotating symmetric Cartesian tensors and employ a dispersion potential based on multipole polarizabilities. At short range, the 2- and 3-body potential energy was corrected to CCSD(T) accuracy using Gaussian approximation potentials. The radial distribution function and self-diffusion coefficient obtained with molecular dynamics simulations agree well with experiments.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Electrocatalytic Pathways: A Comparative Review of the Electrolyte&#8217;s Effects on Five Key Energy Conversion Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal15090835</link>
      <description>Goitom K. Gebremariam, Khalid Siraj, Igor A. Pa&#353;ti, Catalysts. 15(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413915142

                The advancement of efficient energy conversion and storage technologies is fundamentally linked to the development of electrochemical systems, including fuel cells, batteries, and electrolyzers, whose performance depends on key electrocatalytic reactions: hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction (NRR). Beyond catalyst design, the electrolyte microenvironment significantly influences these reactions by modulating charge transfer, intermediate stabilization, and mass transport, making electrolyte engineering a powerful tool for enhancing performance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of how fundamental electrolyte properties, including pH, ionic strength, ion identity, and solvent structure, affect the mechanisms and kinetics of these five reactions. We examine in detail how the electrolyte composition and individual ion contributions impact reaction pathways, catalytic activity, and product selectivity. For HER and OER, we discuss the interplay between acidic and alkaline environments, the effects of specific ions, interfacial electric fields, and catalyst stability. In ORR, we highlight pH-dependent activity, selectivity, and the roles of cations and anions in steering 2e&#8722; versus 4e&#8722; pathways. The CO2RR and NRR sections explore how the electrolyte composition, local pH, buffering capacity, and proton sources influence activity and the product distribution. We also address challenges in electrolyte optimization, such as managing competing reactions and maximizing Faradaic efficiency. By comparing the electrolyte&#8217;s effects across these reactions, this review identifies general trends and design guidelines for enhancing electrocatalytic performance and outlines key open questions and future research directions relevant to practical energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Constructing Monolayer Fe Clusters as Model Catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c05325</link>
      <description>Hengpan Yang, Huizhu Cai, Kai Song, Shijie He, Shangzhao Feng, Zhi Chen, Xue Zhang, Qi Hu, Chuanxin He, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413930379

                Constructing model catalysts to clarify the active sites and elucidate structure&#8211;activity relationships represents a bottleneck issue in electrocatalytic reactions. For instance, Fe-based materials have been widely investigated for various electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR). However, the precise role of Fe in the catalytic mechanism remains debated and is under extensive investigation due to the complex properties of those catalysts. Herein, we successfully construct a series of monolayer Fe clusters (ML-Fe) on a single-crystal Au(111) substrate via vapor deposition under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, which serve as model catalysts for CO2RR. Notably, the size of Fe clusters can be tuned at the atomic scale (&#8764;2 nm) as observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ML-Fe achieves &gt;60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO production during CO2RR. When the Fe layer further increases to form nanoparticles, Fe sites exhibit stronger electron interaction and binding strength with *CO intermediates, consequently shifting the dominant reaction pathway from CO2RR to hydrogen evolution (HER). This work could provide valuable insights into designing model catalysts with well-defined active sites to investigate the structure&#8211;activity relationships in diverse electrocatalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the activity and stability of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based catalyst &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; nano-confinement effect for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reaction in acid electrolyte</title>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a pivotal process in electrochemical water splitting, directly determines energy conversion efficiency. Ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their decent intrinsic activity in acidic media. Previous studies have demonstrated that while Ru exhibits superior OER activity compared to RuO2 in acidic environments, its operational stability remains markedly inferior. This performance dichotomy, coupled with the persistent challenges of active species dissolution and catalyst particle aggregation during prolonged operation, significantly hinders their practical implementation in electrochemical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a carbon nanotube (CNT)/Fe-Ni@RuO2@PANI-350 composite catalyst composed of RuO2 nanoparticles supported on bimetallic Fe-Ni modified CNTs (CNT/Fe-Ni) and encapsulated with polyaniline (PANI). This catalyst utilizes the anchoring effect of bimetallic Fe-Ni sites and the spatial confinement effect of PANI coating layer, effectively inhibiting the dissolution and agglomeration of RuO2 during both high-temperature processing and electrochemical operation, thereby significantly enhancing electrochemical stability. The anchoring strength of RuO2 nanoparticles on CNT/Fe-Ni support via the nano-confinement effect, as well as the microscopic mechanisms underlying the performance enhancement, are revealed by density functional theory calculations and experimental characterizations. The composite catalyst demonstrates fascinating OER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4, exhibiting a low Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec-1 as well as low overpotentials of 188 and 225 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Remarkably, the composite catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced stability, exhibiting only ~30 mV overpotential increase during 150 h continuous operation at 10 mA cm-2. This study highlights a simple yet effective nano-confinement strategy to address the challenges of Ru-based catalysts, and provides a practical paradigm for designing and preparing highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with enhanced stability.</description>

                Abstract The secure and efficient delivery of energy demands advanced solutions, such as protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). Despite their promise, challenges including sluggish oxygen electrode kinetics and phase instability in humid or CO 2 &#8208;rich environments hinder their widespread adoption. Herein, a novel high&#8208;entropy double perovskite oxide (HEDPO), Pr 0.2 La 0.2 Nd 0.2 Na 0.2 Ca 0.2 Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 1.5 Fe 0.5 O 5+&#948; (PLNNCBSCF), engineered to leverage the stabilizing effects of high configurational entropy while delivering superior electrochemical performance is developed. Physicochemical characterization confirms the successful formation of a high&#8208;entropy matrix, providing enhanced structural stability and a high density of catalytically active defects. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the dynamic atomic configurations and heterogeneous electronic distributions within PLNNCBSCF facilitate improved electrochemical reaction kinetics. PCECs incorporating PLNNCBSCF oxygen electrodes demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a peak power density of 1.77 W&#183;cm &#8722;2 in fuel cell mode and a current density of 4.42 A&#183;cm &#8722;2 at 1.3 V in electrolysis cell mode at 650 &#176;C. These findings highlight the potential of HEDPOs as robust, high&#8208;performance oxygen electrodes, paving the way for sustainable energy technologies in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>Reactive Active Learning: An Efficient Approach for Training Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Reacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00920</link>
      <description>Siddarth K. Achar, Priyanka B. Shukla, Chinmay V. Mhatre, Leonardo Bernasconi, Caitlyn Y. Vinger, J. Karl Johnson, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4413942145

                Discovering chemical reaction pathways using quantum mechanics is impractical for many systems of practical interest because of unfavorable scaling and computational cost. While machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained on quantum mechanical data offer a promising alternative, they face challenges for reactive systems due to the need for extensive sampling of the potential energy surface in regions that are far from equilibrium geometries. Unfortunately, traditional MLIP training protocols are not designed for comprehensive reaction exploration. We present a reactive active learning (RAL) framework that is designed to efficiently train MLIPs to achieve near-quantum mechanical accuracy for reactive systems for situations where one may not have prior knowledge of the possible transition states, reaction pathways, or even the potential products. Our method combines automated reaction exploration, uncertainty-driven active learning, and transition state sampling to build accurate potentials. We demonstrate RAL's effectiveness across three different systems: uncatalyzed ammonia synthesis (gas-phase), methanimine hydrolysis (solution phase), and methane activation on titanium carbide surfaces (heterogeneous). The resulting MLIPs accurately predict reaction barriers and transition states. For catalysis, we show that RAL-trained MLIPs identify Ti2C as the most active methane activation surface (90% decomposition at 1000 K) through C-vacancy mediated mechanisms. The framework's ability to simulate large systems (&#8764;900 atoms) over nanosecond time scales provides previously inaccessible insights into surface poisoning and reaction networks. We show that reactive exploration is essential for adequately capturing the potential energy surface, with chemical and configurational sampling working synergistically to improve model accuracy. Our results establish general guidelines for training robust reactive potentials and open new possibilities for computational discovery of catalysts and reaction mechanisms.</description>

                Abstract Cobalt spinel (Co 3 O 4 ) is a dynamically restructuring catalyst under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. So far, little is known about the mechanistic complexity of the OER at different active sites of Co 3 O 4 at the atomic level. Using the A&#8208; and B&#8208;terminations of a single&#8208;crystal Co 3 O 4 (001) model electrode, we apply a combination of density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to identify three main types of active sites of Co 3 O 4 under OER conditions. In addition to tetrahedral and octahedral surface sites, we report the formation of pseudo&#8208;octahedral sites due to a change in the local environment upon adsorption of intermediate species. For all these active sites, we analyze the elementary steps of the OER by descriptor&#8208;based analysis and the concept of degree of span control. While octahedral and pseudo&#8208;octahedral sites are catalytically more active than tetrahedral sites, we show structural sensitivity with respect to the key limiting reaction step, which ranges from O&#9472;O bond formation to O 2 desorption and *OH oxidation. Our modeling strategy, which captures changes in the local environment, elementary steps of the OER, and the contribution of different reaction steps to the current density, provides an integrated and comprehensive framework for describing complex oxide materials under applied bias.</description>

                ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing sustainable materials science, yet a comprehensive and timely evaluation of the rapidly evolving AI techniques applied across the entire materials lifecycle remains lacking. This work reviews AI&#8208;driven advances in sustainable materials, specifically focusing on battery materials, thermal management materials, energy conversion materials, and catalysts. The key patterns, capabilities, and limitations of AI are identified across three interconnected phases: sustainable materials design (leveraging predictive and generative models for accelerated discovery), green processing (integrating adaptive synthesis optimization and autonomous experimentation), and extending to lifecycle management (encompassing real&#8208;time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and intelligent recycling). Then, the persistent challenges, including data sparsity, domain&#8208;specific knowledge integration, and limited model generalizability, are investigated, followed by an exploration of emerging solutions such as federated learning for privacy&#8208;preserving data sharing, physics&#8208;informed neural networks for knowledge integration, and multimodal AI for cross&#8208;modal knowledge transfer. Finally, the computational sustainability challenges of AI methods themselves are also discussed. This review highlights key bottlenecks impeding scalable adoption and discuss pathways for realizing the full potential of AI in sustainable materials development.</description>

                High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently emerged as promising electrocatalysts for complex reactions owing to their tunable electronic structures and diverse, unique binding sites. However, their vast compositional space, in terms of both elemental variety and atomic ratios, presents a major challenge to the rational design of high-performance catalysts, as experimental efforts are often hindered by ambiguous element selection and inefficient trial-and-error methods. In this work, a bottom-up research strategy using machine learning-assisted first-principles calculations was applied to accelerate the design of quinary HEAs toward efficient multielectron transfer reactions. Here, we report the design of PtPdRhRuMo, which exhibits key physicochemical properties favoring the methanol oxidation reaction. Notably, the incorporation of Mo as the fifth element significantly activates specific binding sites on HEA surfaces, enhancing methanol adsorption and, in particular, the water dissociation ability. This facilitates hydroxyl species formation, which effectively mitigates CO intermediate adherence while promoting the complete oxidation of CH3OH to CO2 via alternative reaction pathways. Guided by theoretical predictions, experimental samples with different morphologies of mesoporous PtPdRhRuMo catalyst (m-HEANP(Mo) nanoparticles and m-HEAF(Mo) thin film) were then synthesized, demonstrating superior electrocatalysis with a large current density of up to 18.20 mA cm-2 and a mass activity of 9.89 A mgPt-1, alongside the long-term durability for efficient methanol electrooxidation applications.</description>

      <title>What formate electro-oxidation can teach us about CO poisoning on Pt during biomass oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7263225/v1</link>

                Abstract Catalyst deactivation due to *CO poisoning is a persistent challenge in the electrochemical oxidation of biomass-derived molecules such as glycerol and glucose. On platinum catalysts, *CO forms readily as a reaction intermediate, blocking active sites and requiring high overpotentials for removal&#8212;often leading to undesired overoxidation of valuable products. Understanding the fundamental origins of *CO formation is thus critical for designing more selective and stable catalysts. Since biomass oxidation can be extremely complex and involve a multitude of adsorbates and products, here we use a simplified model system, formate oxidation, to investigate *CO formation on Pt in alkaline pH . Starting from operando surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy, we show that the adsorption configuration of formate determines if the surface will be poisoned by *CO. Oxygen-bound formate (*OOCH) undergoes direct and stable oxidation to CO&#8322;, while carbon-bound formate (*COOH) disproportionates to form *CO&#8211;*OH, initiating poisoning. These insights offer a mechanistic foundation for designing Pt-based catalysts that resist *CO formation by selectively stabilizing *OOCH over *COOH intermediates, with broader implications for improving biomass electrooxidation performance.</description>

                Abstract Fenton&#8208;like systems utilizing micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;engineered catalysts have emerged as a promising technology for water remediation, demonstrating distinctive advantages via their efficient electron transport networks. This innovative approach not only significantly reduces oxidant consumption but also enables thorough mineralization of contaminants. However, current research faces critical challenges in fundamental mechanistic understanding, particularly regarding reactor scale&#8208;up strategies and biological synergy mechanisms, where a cohesive theoretical framework remains to be established. This comprehensive review systematically addresses four pivotal aspects: i) Mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer dynamics and pollutant transformation pathways in micro&#8208;electric field&#8208;enhanced Fenton systems; ii) Development of structure&#8208;activity relationship models for system optimization; iii) Implementation of modular scale&#8208;up methodologies with pilot&#8208;scale validation for engineering feasibility assessment; iv) Quantitative environmental impact evaluation using full lifecycle assessment under carbon neutrality objectives. By methodically analyzing technical bottlenecks and advancement pathways, this work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing micro&#8208;electric field regulation in environmental remediation applications. The insights presented are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable water treatment solutions, offering innovative approaches for pollution control aligned with global carbon emission reduction targets.</description>

      <title>Pb-Induced Electronic Structure Modification Enhances Formic Acid Electrooxidation on Pd&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c04219</link>

                The efficiency of formic acid electrooxidation (FAEO) is often hindered by CO poisoning via the indirect pathway, underscoring the need for catalysts that promote the direct (CO-free) oxidation route. Pd-based catalysts are promising, but a limited understanding of surface interactions and catalytic behavior restricts further development. Density functional theory (DFT) combined with Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis was employed to investigate the FAEO on Pd3Pb(111) and Pd(111) surfaces, revealing a key insight into their electronic and catalytic behavior. Incorporation of Pb into the Pd lattice enhances the catalytic performance by modifying the electronic structure and introducing new active sites. This study revealed the role of the subsurface Pb atom, which enhances HCOO binding at Pd&#8211;Pd bridge sites and strengthens CO and H adsorption at hexagonal closest packed (hcp) hollow sites over face-centered cubic (fcc) sites. The FAEO process proceeds more efficiently on Pd3Pb via O&#8211;H bond cleavage, forming an HCOO intermediate with a lower activation energy (0.29 eV) than on Pd (0.35 eV). Pd3Pb favors the HCOO-mediated pathway, while Pd prefers the COOH-mediated route. Additionally, Pb significantly lowers the energy barrier for HCOO rotation (0.51 vs 0.84 eV), enhancing CO-free oxidation.</description>

      <title>Effects of Charge, Dopant, and H Saturation on the Hydrogen Evolution Activity of Au&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Thiolate-Protected Nanoclusters</title>

                This study examines the effects of charge, dopant type, and hydrogen saturation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of thiolate-protected Au25-based nanoclusters using density functional theory (DFT). By extending the analysis to include up to 10 hydrogen atoms, this work captures the behavior of these nanoclusters under realistic HER reaction conditions, providing a broader understanding of the catalytic properties. Our findings, supported by Pourbaix diagrams, reveal that high hydrogen coverages dominate under HER-relevant potentials. Pt- and Pd-doped clusters exhibit remarkable structural stability, retaining their icosahedral core even at high hydrogen coverage. The detachment of thiol (HSR) and HAu-S(R)H molecules creates more accessible active sites enhancing catalytic efficiency. These clusters also support low H (2H) coverage states at less negative potentials, further contributing to their promising catalytic activity reported in the experimental literature. In contrast, Cu-, Ag-, Zn-, Cd-, and Hg-doped clusters undergo structural collapse of the icosahedral core as hydrogen coverage increases and stabilize only high coverage clusters (&gt;7H), correlating with their lower reactivity observed experimentally. These results highlight the critical role of dopant-induced structural and electronic dynamics in governing HER pathways and provide new insights into designing efficient nanocluster catalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Cone-Shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton Method: Efficient and Robust Single-Ended Transition State Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c01015</link>

                Efficient transition state location is a central challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. While single-ended methods are more efficient than double-ended methods, their convergence is often highly sensitive to the quality of the initial guess. Here, we propose a Cone-shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton (CCQN) method, which introduces a cone-shaped constraint to restrict the search direction, thereby effectively guiding the system from potential well regions toward saddle regions. After crossing the inflection curve, the optimization switches to the partitioned rational function optimization algorithm for further refinement. This curvature partitioned optimization strategy reduces the sensitivity to the quality of the initial guess while maintaining the efficiency of single-ended methods. Across 150 transition state optimization tasks with varying initial guess qualities, CCQN achieves an overall success rate of 93.3%, requiring only approximately 50 energy-force evaluations on average. The method exhibits strong robustness and convergence efficiency, offering a new tool for high-throughput transition state searches and mechanistic studies of complex catalytic reactions.</description>

                Precise modulation of the electronic structure in transition metals, particularly the d-band center position and spin state, remains a critical challenge to expediting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. Herein, we report a NiPt/Ni-heterostructured catalyst enabling simultaneous optimization of the d-band electronic structure and spin state of Ni through regulation of the NiPt and Ni bridge sites. Combining operando spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, density functional theory, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we establish that the coordination environment and spin states of Ni at the bridge sites were effectively modulated by altering the Pt content, achieving a transition of Ni centers from the low-spin to high-spin state, and optimized intermediate adsorption/desorption behaviors. The resulting NiPt/Ni catalyst exhibits an exceptional HER performance in acidic media, achieving a benchmark current density of -10 mA cm-2 at a mere 9.8 mV overpotential and delivering an industrial-scale 1.0 A cm-2 current density in PEM electrolysis at 1.75 V.</description>

                Abstract Many high-entropy oxides exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting. In this study, a coating of oxide-carbide composites containing Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, and Mo was electrodeposited in a C 2 H 6 SO (DMSO)-based solution. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the presence of carbides, oxides, and oxygen vacancies. Except for some metallic nickel, most metals exist in the oxidized or hydroxide states. Aqua- and chloro-complexes of metal ions have been proposed to form oxides and carbides on copper via the reduction of hydrated water and organic molecules. The coating exhibited high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline solution, achieving an overpotential of 216 mV, corresponding to a current density of 10 mA cm. The long-term stability at the current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 was investigated for 50 h, with a stable overpotential and minor surface dissolution. The catalytic activity was determined using density functional theory, and the unsaturated oxidation number of the metal atoms was calculated to depict the relationship between the binding state and the overpotential of the active sites.

      <title>MatterGPT: A Generative Transformer for Multi-Property Inverse Design of Solid-State Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7463697/v1</link>
      <description>Lei Wang, Yan Chen, Xueru Wang, Xiaobin Deng, Yilun Liu, Xi Chen, Jun Zhang, Yunwei Zhang, Hang Xiao, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024291

                Abstract Inverse design of solid-state materials with desired properties remains a central challenge in materials science, requiring exploration of vast chemical spaces containing potentially 10100 possible structures. Current generative approaches face limitations in computational efficiency, multi-property targeting precision and mechanistic interpretability. Here, we introduce MatterGPT, an autoregressive Transformer-decoder architecture that leverages SLICES (Simplified Line-Input Crystal-Encoding System) representation to generate novel crystals through conditional next-token prediction. Trained on 306,533 crystal structures, MatterGPT achieves &gt; 99% structural validity, &gt; 99% structural uniqueness and &gt; 50% novelty rates while targeting both specific lattice-insensitive and lattice-sensitive properties. Critically, MatterGPT enables direct multi-property generation without post-generation filtering. Interpretability analysis reveals clear property-guided generation mechanisms and systematic chemical space exploration. The comprehensive open-source release, including MatterGPT Hub integration platform, establishes sequence-based autoregressive generation as a computationally efficient and interpretable paradigm for inverse crystal design, accelerating materials discovery across energy storage, electronics, and functional applications.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Modeling of Rare Earth Ions in Photonic Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bio.70297</link>
      <description>Dennis Delali Kwesi Wayo, Mohd Zulkifli Bin Mohamad Noor, Masoud Darvish Ganji, Leonardo Goliatt, Luminescence. 40(9)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414024557

                ABSTRACT Rare&#8208;earth ions (REIs), especially trivalent lanthanides (Ln), are central to photonic technologies due to sharp intra&#8208;4f transitions, long lifetimes, and host&#8208;insensitive emission. However, modeling REIs remains challenging due to localized 4f orbitals, strong electron correlation, and multiplet structures. This review summarizes atomistic modeling strategies combining quantum chemistry and machine learning (ML). Traditional methods, DFT+, hybrid functionals (HSE06), , and DMFT, are benchmarked; for example, hybrid DFT reproduces 4f&#8211;5d gaps in Ce:YAG within 0.1&#8211;0.2 eV. Wavefunction methods like CASSCF and CASPT2 capture Stark splittings and transition strengths in Eu:Y SiO. ML models trained on DFT data predict bandgaps with 0.2 eV error and aid inverse design of Ce&#8208;doped phosphors with 505 nm emission and 60% retention at 640 K. Unlike prior reviews, this work bridges high&#8208;level quantum modeling with ML&#8208;driven screening across key applications: upconversion (Yb&#8211;Er:NaYF), lasers (Nd:YAG), quantum memories (Pr:Y SiO), and sensors (SrAl O:Eu, Dy). Covering over 20 REI&#8211;host systems, it integrates insights from DFT, Monte Carlo, MD, and ML potentials. The review thus provides both a methodological guide and a resource for designing next&#8208;generation REI&#8208;based photonic materials.</description>

                Abstract Platinum and non&#8208;precious metal (PtM) alloy multimetallic catalysts have been developed to address the kinetically sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurring at the cathodes of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, these catalysts inevitably suffer from poor lot&#8208;to&#8208;lot consistency of chemical compositions and structures during production, and the transition metal leaching in practical applications. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance monometallic Pt catalysts using innovative nanoarchitectures has become important to address the technical challenges that hinder the widespread deployment of the PEMFCs. Here, a monometallic Pt catalyst is developed, which composes of self&#8208;hole&#8208;confined Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;anchored Pt single&#8208;atoms. The monometallic Pt catalyst exhibits high ORR activity and durability, which is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multimetallic PtM alloy catalysts. A membrane electrode assembly utilizing the monometallic Pt catalyst as a cathode demonstrated a mass activity of 0.87 A mg Pt &#8722;1 @ 0.9 V iR&#8208;free . After undergoing 30000 square&#8208;wave cycles, the assembly exhibited a 23% decline in mass activity and a potential drop of 16 mV at 0.8 A cm &#8722;2 . The results of this study would lead to a critical breakthrough in the performance of monometallic Pt catalysts utilized in PEMFCs.</description>

                The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis lead to high overpotentials, limiting cost-effective green hydrogen production. Ni-based catalysts, recognized as promising OER electrocatalysts, require electronic structure modulation to enhance performance. However, under oxidizing conditions, Ni-based materials undergo surface reconstruction with significant electronic alterations, rendering bulk-phase studies less practical. Recent efforts focus on regulating reconstructed surface electronic structures for improved efficiency, underscoring the need for a systematic review on this critical topic. This review highlights the fundamental progress regarding the electronic structure regulation of reconstructed surface of Ni-based OER electrocatalysts for better understanding the surface reconstruction process and the structure-activity relationship, including the basic understanding of OER mechanism and surface reconstruction of Ni-based materials, the principles and practical applications of key electronic structure descriptors with their respective advantages and limitations, and recent advancements and developing bottle-necks in surface reconstruction chemistry across diverse Ni-based OER catalyst systems. Finally, the challenges facing surface reconstruction of Ni-based OER catalysts are summarized, and several future prospects are proposed to guide the in-depth analysis of the reconstruction mechanism and the rational design of Ni-based OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Correction to the Adsorption Free Energy of Oxygen-Containing Intermediates on Pt(111) by Machine-Learned Force Field-Based Thermodynamic Integrations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.5c03465</link>
      <description>Thanh-Nam Huynh, Bassim Mounssef, Dmitry Sharapa, Felix Studt, Tom&#225;&#353; Bu&#269;ko, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4414039479

                Accurate and efficient descriptions of adsorption free energy are of fundamental importance to bringing theoretical findings closer to experiments. The present study introduced a robust combination of machine learning and (un)constrained molecular dynamics-based &#955;-path thermodynamic integration methods to accurately estimate the anharmonic correction to the free energy of adsorbing systems and, thus, the adsorption free energy. The approach was demonstrated for the adsorptions of the oxygenated species exhibiting different anharmonic behaviors, namely, atomic oxygen (O), hydroxyl (OH), and hydroperoxyl (OOH), on the Pt(111) surface. The corrected adsorption free energies reveal the significant influence of anharmonic effects, which could account for up to 39% of the entropy loss estimated by the conventional harmonic approximation, even at near room temperature. This highlights the limitations of the current harmonic approximation and underscores the need to account for anharmonicity for better descriptions of the adsorption processes. The present method paves the way for the accurate adsorption of free energy calculations to be performed routinely toward more powerful theoretical predictions of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions.</description>

      <title>Repurposing polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste to capture carbon dioxide</title>

                Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a ubiquitous polymer with a lack of viable waste management solutions besides mechanical recycling, incineration, and landfilling. Herein, we demonstrate a chemical upcycling of PET waste into materials for CO2 capture via aminolysis. The aminolysis reaction products-a bis-aminoamide (BAETA) and oligomers-exhibit high CO2 capture capacity up to 3.4 moles per kilogram as a stand-alone organic solid material. BAETA shows strong chemisorption featuring high selectivity for CO2 capture from flue gas (5 to 20% CO2) and ambient air (~400 parts per million CO2) under humid conditions. Our thermally stable material (&gt;250&#176;C) enables CO2 capture at high temperatures (up to 170&#176;C) for multiple cycles. Scalability of the material production was demonstrated by performing aminolysis of untreated consumer waste PET of 1 kilogram. Our approach introduces a simple and straightforward solution that can address both plastic waste and carbon dioxide, offering a potential pathway toward net negative emissions.</description>
