With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.

The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site‐driven C‐C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal‐acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce‐HY catalysts at 300 °C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure‐performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably‐improved adsorption capability towards short‐chain intermediates.

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2–7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C–C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well‐defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum‐oxide‐supported nano‐Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram‐scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano‐Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano‐Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid‐phase organic reactions.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon–neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm−2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH–, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into γ-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/γ-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that ‧OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu–MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu–MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1–MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1–MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4•−), hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide radical (O2•−), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC‒MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu–MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO−) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content – TPh (87.5 ± 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon – DOC (63.8 ± 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand – COD (87.7 ± 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium–organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst – the MOF – with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.

Abstract Organic peroxides (ROOR′), solid or liquid with the bivalent OO structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen–oxygen linkage. The oxygen–oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self‐accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical‐specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t ‐butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0527.3630</link>
      <description>Serhat Uzan, Ey&#252;p Ba&#351;aran, Turkish Journal of Chemistry. 47(6)] 2023.
The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</description>

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</description>

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2&#8211;7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C&#8211;C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Ionic liquid dopant induced 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructures with doped heteroatoms and highly dispersed Ag for electrochemical upgrading of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</title>

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon&#8211;neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH&#8211;, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.</description>

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into &#947;-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/&#947;-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/&#947;-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.</description>

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.</description>

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that &#8231;OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.</description>

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu&#8211;MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu&#8211;MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4&#8226;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography&#8210;mass spectrometry (LC&#8210;MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu&#8211;MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.</description>

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO&#8722;) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content &#8211; TPh (87.5 &#177; 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon &#8211; DOC (63.8 &#177; 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand &#8211; COD (87.7 &#177; 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.</description>

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium&#8211;organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst &#8211; the MOF &#8211; with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.</description>

Abstract Organic peroxides (R&#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743;R&#8242;), solid or liquid with the bivalent &#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743; structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen&#8211;oxygen linkage. The oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self&#8208;accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical&#8208;specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t &#8208;butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.</description>

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.

The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (ΔG↓ = ΔH – TΔS↑), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., <10 m2 g–1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50–100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 °C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 °C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 °C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 °C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. > 96%, CO2 Conv. > 99%, H2/CO ≈ 0.98), long-time stability (>100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 °C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. < 3%, CO2 Conv. < 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.

The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site‐driven C‐C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal‐acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce‐HY catalysts at 300 °C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure‐performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably‐improved adsorption capability towards short‐chain intermediates.

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2–7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C–C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well‐defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum‐oxide‐supported nano‐Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram‐scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano‐Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano‐Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid‐phase organic reactions.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon–neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm−2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH–, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into γ-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/γ-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that ‧OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu–MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu–MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1–MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1–MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4•−), hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide radical (O2•−), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC‒MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu–MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO−) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content – TPh (87.5 ± 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon – DOC (63.8 ± 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand – COD (87.7 ± 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium–organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst – the MOF – with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.

Abstract Organic peroxides (ROOR′), solid or liquid with the bivalent OO structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen–oxygen linkage. The oxygen–oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self‐accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical‐specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t ‐butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0527.3630</link>
      <description>Serhat Uzan, Ey&#252;p Ba&#351;aran, Turkish Journal of Chemistry. 47(6)] 2023.
The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</description>

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</description>

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2&#8211;7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C&#8211;C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303573</link>

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Ionic liquid dopant induced 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructures with doped heteroatoms and highly dispersed Ag for electrochemical upgrading of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148580</link>

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon&#8211;neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH&#8211;, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.</description>

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into &#947;-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/&#947;-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/&#947;-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.</description>

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Construction of novel surfactant-modified metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 with enhanced piezocatalytic degradation of diclofenac sodium</title>

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that &#8231;OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] A heterogeneously activated peroxymonosulfate with a Co and Cu codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework efficiently degrades tetracycline in water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcat.2023.113817</link>
      <description>Qianyuan Mo, Haoyuan Zheng, Guishang Sheng, Molecular Catalysis. 553(None)] 2024.
In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu&#8211;MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu&#8211;MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4&#8226;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography&#8210;mass spectrometry (LC&#8210;MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu&#8211;MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.</description>

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO&#8722;) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content &#8211; TPh (87.5 &#177; 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon &#8211; DOC (63.8 &#177; 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand &#8211; COD (87.7 &#177; 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.</description>

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium&#8211;organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst &#8211; the MOF &#8211; with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.</description>

Abstract Organic peroxides (R&#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743;R&#8242;), solid or liquid with the bivalent &#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743; structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen&#8211;oxygen linkage. The oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self&#8208;accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical&#8208;specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t &#8208;butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.</description>

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.

The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (ΔG↓ = ΔH – TΔS↑), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., <10 m2 g–1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50–100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 °C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 °C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 °C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 °C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. > 96%, CO2 Conv. > 99%, H2/CO ≈ 0.98), long-time stability (>100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 °C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. < 3%, CO2 Conv. < 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.

The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site‐driven C‐C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal‐acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce‐HY catalysts at 300 °C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure‐performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably‐improved adsorption capability towards short‐chain intermediates.

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2–7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C–C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well‐defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum‐oxide‐supported nano‐Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram‐scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano‐Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano‐Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid‐phase organic reactions.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon–neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm−2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH–, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into γ-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/γ-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that ‧OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu–MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu–MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1–MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1–MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4•−), hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide radical (O2•−), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC‒MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu–MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO−) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content – TPh (87.5 ± 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon – DOC (63.8 ± 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand – COD (87.7 ± 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium–organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst – the MOF – with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.

Abstract Organic peroxides (ROOR′), solid or liquid with the bivalent OO structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen–oxygen linkage. The oxygen–oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self‐accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical‐specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t ‐butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter.

      <title>[liquid-metal] Intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2</title>

      <description>Serhat Uzan, Ey&#252;p Ba&#351;aran, Turkish Journal of Chemistry. 47(6)] 2023.
The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</description>

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</description>

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2&#8211;7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C&#8211;C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Ionic liquid dopant induced 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructures with doped heteroatoms and highly dispersed Ag for electrochemical upgrading of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148580</link>

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon&#8211;neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH&#8211;, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.</description>

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into &#947;-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/&#947;-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/&#947;-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Uncovering the Synergy between Gold and Sodium on ZrO2 for Boosting the Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction: In-Situ Spectroscopic Investigations</title>

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.</description>

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that &#8231;OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] A heterogeneously activated peroxymonosulfate with a Co and Cu codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework efficiently degrades tetracycline in water</title>

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu&#8211;MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu&#8211;MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4&#8226;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography&#8210;mass spectrometry (LC&#8210;MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu&#8211;MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.</description>

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO&#8722;) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content &#8211; TPh (87.5 &#177; 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon &#8211; DOC (63.8 &#177; 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand &#8211; COD (87.7 &#177; 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.</description>

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium&#8211;organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst &#8211; the MOF &#8211; with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.</description>

Abstract Organic peroxides (R&#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743;R&#8242;), solid or liquid with the bivalent &#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743; structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen&#8211;oxygen linkage. The oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self&#8208;accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical&#8208;specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t &#8208;butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.</description>

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.

The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (ΔG↓ = ΔH – TΔS↑), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., <10 m2 g–1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50–100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 °C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 °C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 °C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 °C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. > 96%, CO2 Conv. > 99%, H2/CO ≈ 0.98), long-time stability (>100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 °C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. < 3%, CO2 Conv. < 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.

The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site‐driven C‐C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal‐acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce‐HY catalysts at 300 °C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure‐performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably‐improved adsorption capability towards short‐chain intermediates.

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2–7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C–C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well‐defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum‐oxide‐supported nano‐Ni3C (nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano‐Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram‐scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano‐Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano‐Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid‐phase organic reactions.

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon–neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm−2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH–, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into γ-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/γ-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/γ-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that ‧OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu–MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu–MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1–MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1–MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4•−), hydroxyl radical (•OH), superoxide radical (O2•−), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometry (LC‒MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu–MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO−) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content – TPh (87.5 ± 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon – DOC (63.8 ± 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand – COD (87.7 ± 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium–organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst – the MOF – with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.

Abstract Organic peroxides (ROOR′), solid or liquid with the bivalent OO structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen–oxygen linkage. The oxygen–oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self‐accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical‐specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t ‐butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2</title>

      <description>Serhat Uzan, Ey&#252;p Ba&#351;aran, Turkish Journal of Chemistry. 47(6)] 2023.
The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</description>

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</description>

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2&#8211;7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C&#8211;C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.</description>

Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Ionic liquid dopant induced 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructures with doped heteroatoms and highly dispersed Ag for electrochemical upgrading of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148580</link>

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon&#8211;neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH&#8211;, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.</description>

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into &#947;-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/&#947;-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/&#947;-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.</description>

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.</description>

Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that &#8231;OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] A heterogeneously activated peroxymonosulfate with a Co and Cu codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework efficiently degrades tetracycline in water</title>

In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu&#8211;MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu&#8211;MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4&#8226;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography&#8210;mass spectrometry (LC&#8210;MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu&#8211;MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.</description>

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO&#8722;) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content &#8211; TPh (87.5 &#177; 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon &#8211; DOC (63.8 &#177; 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand &#8211; COD (87.7 &#177; 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.</description>

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium&#8211;organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst &#8211; the MOF &#8211; with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.</description>

Abstract Organic peroxides (R&#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743;R&#8242;), solid or liquid with the bivalent &#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743; structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen&#8211;oxygen linkage. The oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self&#8208;accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical&#8208;specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t &#8208;butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.</description>

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.

The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (ΔG↓ = ΔH – TΔS↑), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., <10 m2 g–1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50–100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 °C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 °C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 °C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 °C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. > 96%, CO2 Conv. > 99%, H2/CO ≈ 0.98), long-time stability (>100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 °C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. < 3%, CO2 Conv. < 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.</description>

The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (&#916;G&#8595; = &#916;H &#8211; T&#916;S&#8593;), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., &lt;10 m2 g&#8211;1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50&#8211;100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 &#176;C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 &#176;C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 &#176;C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 &#176;C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. &gt; 96%, CO2 Conv. &gt; 99%, H2/CO &#8776; 0.98), long-time stability (&gt;100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 &#176;C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. &lt; 3%, CO2 Conv. &lt; 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.</description>
