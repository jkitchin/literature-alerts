#+title: Literature alerts

Eventually this will do something on a schedule to pull new alerts from openalex.org

But first:

* TODO Figure out how to run an action on a schedule

* TODO Figure out how to have an action create an artifact

probably a file, and maybe also a GH issue

* TODO Figure out how to have an OpenAlex API key as a GH secret used in a script

* TODO write a Python script using OpenAlex to get new articles
